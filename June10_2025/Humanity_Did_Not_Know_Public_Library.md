# Humanity Did Not Know 

Humanity did not know this was a world-wide common problem, that hate and other isues were problems not only in some religions, some cultures, some societies, but kept re-appearing throuout the world.

James Joyce articulated this crisis in his body of work, his ficiton writings and commentary / lectures.

&nbsp;

## Public Library / Education

MLK Jr's # The1954Equation required vast public library. # NotGoodEnoughMLKjr

Until better printing machines, powered shipping, book transfers, radio communications, airports - it was not easy to recognize and understand the scope of the problem was global and all time periods. MLK Jr articulated both geography and **time periods** this was a common human brain problem, a common education probelms, a common 'History is a nightmare" (James Joyce) passed-down value that we msut stop with the the technological changes and understandings we had demonstrated with World War Two (ten years before 1954).

# "The 1954 Equation"

&nbsp;

"Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong. It's wrong to throw our lives away in riotous living. No matter if everybody in Detroit is doing it, it's wrong. It always will be wrong, and it always has been wrong. It's wrong in every age and it's wrong in every nation. Some things are right and some things are wrong, no matter if everybody is doing the contrary. Some things in this universe are absolute." - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
