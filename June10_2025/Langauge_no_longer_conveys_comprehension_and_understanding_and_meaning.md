James Joyce is a great author at drawing circles around this crisis of metaphor not being understood.

"The Fiction NonFictiono Equation" of Joseph Campbell    

Language no longer conveys meaning.   
Language no longer conveys understanding.    
Language no longer conveys comprehension.   

War of words, Battles of John 1:1 

Propeganda, marketing, advertising, public relations, mind-fuck, Cambridge Anlytica, Students of Vlad Surkov, Students of Edward Bernays.

Banksy was one of the few to articulate this to the masses, but not good enough for people.

Malala has conveyed what James Joyce was saying about Dublin, Malala about Swat Valley.   

Super Wikpedia, Series of Wikis, serious effort on Wiki is about buidling relationships between meaning / comrephension / understanding and not just sweet sounding popular "well written" Prose.

I am sickened by well written prose and well crafted movies / films / Television / content that deeaches us into Eden and Heaven without our own desire to progress / construction / authoring it.

I have experienced what Marshall McLuhan described in 1968 book (year before my 1969 birth) "War and Peace in the Global Village" with the Ten Thunders of Finnegans Wake, and all the other combined things Marshall McLuhan (died in 1980) and Joseph Campbell (died in 1987) have said about James Joyce (Finnegans Wake).

I have seen how people feel and react towards black and white films.  
I have witnessed and exepreinced peers responding to 1980's films vs 1990's films.   
What McLuhan emphasizes about clothing / fashion / Prankqueen in Joyce.

Fashion changes, cosmetic changes, color themes. Music style changes. Music technology changes (analog tape, digital, multi-track recording, live broadcasting, in-pocket device to access online library when wanting to share some clip). The over-writing of Dr. Who and other shows, the days of TV before it was even recorded and always live. Langauge shifts across time.

I have experienced this when so many have not seem to recognize it other than in a lot of chiche ways. We do not cheery pick goodness from the past, we declare a whole time period good or bad, and we are not progressively cherry-picking and carrying-forward good.

Why since 2013 is Malala not a constant emphasis and assertion on social media? Not good enough Malala. 

Language no longer conveys.

Campbell described this in 1987: "Ortega y Gasset talks about the environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a mechanistic interpretation of the world came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive to the hero. The hero is today running up against a hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need."

Marshall McLuhan is correct, people driven to Bluesky in 2024, new technology - new medium - and not addressing the Twitter problem Neil Postman 1985 and Carl Sagan 1995 both articulated about length.

Why after decades of Twiter / SMS, have we not shifted back towards Wikipedia. Siple Wikipedia to complex, and multiple Wiki Values systems of inclusive (beyond scope of Wikipedia itself). Every Subreddit had a wikipedia, but the streaming recency bias of latest 12 hours defines communities. We abandoned the precursor to Wiki systems, the Internet FAQ on topics.
