Weapon systems and technology advancement, everything from biological to chemical and remote drones / remote video feeds and independently intelligent devices that can navigate around defenses and such... keep growing.  Our love and compassion faith of every person declaring hate and war bad seems to decline.

Where would we really be if we had put more effort into building homes, having stable education, building a stable Super Wiki systems of shared open free knowledge contributed by all.
