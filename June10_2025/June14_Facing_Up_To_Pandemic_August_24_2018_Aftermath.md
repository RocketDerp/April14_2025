My mind started to ponder the August 24, 2018 world-wide disclosure about manipulation to argue and debate insincerely regarding a pandemic / disease outbreak.  Part of "Operation Matthew 4:19" evidence going back to Twitter year 2014. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192  - this story was covered all over the world on news sites, including Fox News.

# June 14 - Facing Up Now

&nbsp;

The way people in USA debate and argue the goodness of Donald Trump, the way people debate and argue the goodness of RFK Jr, the way people argue and debate goodness of people is very difficult and complex.

But the pandemic was arguing about networks of spreading a virus, peer to peer spreading, the shutting down of airports (like after September 11, 2001 airport shutdowns). There are military biological warfare! We aren't debating the dynamics of a human soul and spirit like debating the minds of RFK Jr and Donald Trump and Vlad Putin... we are debating ALL of humanity against science interpretation and anti-science known defects.

Like Homeopathy, like "Horse Paste" solutions, like snake oil. 

Measuring the goodness of Donald Trump's leadership is a far more tricky and subjective debate than if an invisible to the eye virus actually spreads and that staying at home saves lives / changing behavior regarding crowds and airports and such.

But people were mind-fucked beyond all belief by Operation Matthew 4:19 since 2014 to debate this. Almost nobody brought up these Russia disclosures of 2018 when February 2020 Wuhan-originated airport-delivered COVID-19 Pandemic was world topic!

For almost all people, it was a matter of information systems. ELIZA effect of media choices. People were not getting microscopes and studying the vaccine themselves, it was a matter of information flow and information mills / amusement mills / rumor mills / clickbait mills / fiction vs. non-fiction favoring.

And it was a total shitshow.  And that wasn't dealing with much subjectivity! This was hard science! This was hard morality values of egoism / egomania vs. saving strangers who might not get infected for 10 more days by another intermediate person that got infected!

I saw very little educational focus on 1918 pandemic. Very little of how vaccinations are made, what a factory looked like, what it looked like under microscope and animation models. I saw very little university-style education, and a lot of "talking heads" debating with each other who were more about sounding good on media systems than it was about cram-session of science and network effects of how computer virus (Internet Research Agency) or a biological virus (COVID-19) spreads peer to peer, person to person.

## Harsh to realize

Just how bad this was, we had 10 months before the vaccine was made and started to be available in December 2020, and there was little *response of education* to teach about what was to come, and anticipating, and providing excellent high-quality education material to predictable resistance (conditioned by Russia via social media since March 2013).

Military biological warfare, NSA - they have to grasp meme warfare and just didn't take mind-fucking as a problem.

Now since January 2024 it's gotten so much worse and into *subejective* complex things about Donald Trump's mental health. Very hard to debate.  But SCIENCE of a virus and the negative side-effects of prevention - that isn't subjective, it is all the scientists of the world - all science thinking systems of humanity - against a microscopic virus that has evolved on our Earth. A predator that spreads by living creatures, including humans, getting on airplanes and on ships.

What I'm saying is that I haven't fully processed all this realization in June 2025 and I'm just now becoming self aware of just how bad a "less spiritual" war against a virus debates went in USA - and how there has been no positive spiritual follow up (a world wide funeral service for all those we lost, common bond, thank-you parties for all the workers and medical people who served during the war against disease)...
