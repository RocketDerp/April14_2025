"Why is the media ignoring growing resistance to Trump?"    
Margaret Sullivan   

"Protest actions like ‘Hands Off’ and ‘No Kings’ are sweeping across the US. But the media is barely paying attention"

## How did We as a Nation get here?

1. We have forgotten **art teaching, symbolism teaching tool** of the Great Seal of the United States of America for over 100 years, since about 1910 we stopped teaching it. A revival by Joseph Campbell in the middle 1980's has been largely ignored.

2. We have forotten Neil Postman in the pbulic mind since year 2005. Even though his son Andrew Postman brought him to public attention in February 2017, rather quickly forgotten again. Same with stories taht appear here and there. But it impacts everyone.

Both of these impact everyone over age 12.

## Social Meddia users are the core concern

Every classic news story covers social media reactions. Yet, there isn't an organized campaign of social media resistance.

Bitching and complaining without self-awareness of "The Media" is a constant Social Media behavior. 

Fox News HDTV was built upon bad-mouthing "The Media" using Electric Media. Social Media users have adopted this same Fox News / Rupert Murdoch technique without self-awarenes.

This is a core point of Marshall McLuhan:

“One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in.”
― Marshall McLuhan, War and Peace in the Global Village, 1968

One thing social media users, even POPULAR successful money-making social media users don't grasp, is social media.

Grasping the concepts of Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman in year 2025 is probably as important as a religion, if not more so. The monomyth has run amock. Religions have run amock. Religions are media empires and media systems, media platforms, media venues (Church is a media venue, Mosque is a media venue, Synagogoe is a media venue, Temple is a media venue, we need to take this all very seriously and stop not loading it into our brain.)

The motivation to hate. The motivation to war. The motivation to terrorism comes from our common metaphors and interpretation. Our science fiction story telling. Be it Star Wars, Mohammad's Quran, The Bible, etc.

“Public education does not serve a public. It creates a public. And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens? Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools. The right answer depends on two things, and two things alone: the existence of shared narratives and the capacity of such narratives to provide an inspired reason for schooling.”
― Neil Postman, The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School, September 1995 (Eternal September)

## Actions / What to Do?

### Make Peter P a household name in USA

Admit we lost an information war. Admit faith in Twitter was a mistake. Sharon Stone was correct in 2024. Admit we made a mistake and don't be hateful and chalk it up to electric media growing pain. If we had focused on Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan more, we could have prevented it, but we did not prevent it. Operation Matthew 4:19 since March 2013 wrecked us, our own smartphone media addictions / iPad addictions wrecked us. And we went on an electric media binge until black out drunk for 15 years. Admit we failed and start rebuilding.

## Outcomes: World Peace

We are overdue on facing up to the bad side of our brains and minds. If we don't take world peace seriously, we will not get world peace.

We have the ability to entertain ourselves with computer systems, sports, games. But we continue to wage wars, promote hate, teach warfare, build webapon systems, orginate hate, glorify violence and glorify hate.

Like climate change science and other long-term damage from a population of 8 billion people, if we don't actually take seriously the limits of freedom and limits of liberty on a world of 10 billion people future - then we are going to run into large systemic planet-wide stress factors caused by the aggregated behavior of 10 billion people!

Lifestyles change because 10 billion people, the Earth is still the same size! The number of fish the ocean produces hasn't grown, but the number of humans consuming fish has grown. Lifestyles of freedom and liberty and cutting down trees and mining only last so long with 10 billion people all wanting to gather up what is very often one-time resources... that used to be spread among 1 billion people or 2 billion people.

Hating other people, out-group hate, has been foundation of our socialigialy oriented religions. Joseph Campbell in Power of Myth summerizes this pretty well. Out-group hate, love only for the in-group, is foundation to our past concepts of brotherhood. And we have outgrown this in a world of 10 billion people capable of rockets and ICBM mutually assured destruction and remote-controlled weapon systems.
