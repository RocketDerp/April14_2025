Sustained, focused, persistent, repeating.

What I see and witness


1. "They are Nazi Germanys"
2. "They are Hitler"
3. "They are in Germany 1933, they are Nazi Germans"

What I do not see and witness:

1. "MLK Jr was correct, what he had to say on topic x"
2. "Neil Postman was correct, what he had to say on topic y of Twitter and Facebook and Fox News"

## Recency Bias Abounds

People can repeat 1933 Nazi Germany, can repeat hollocaust, can repeat genocide, but can not assert goodness or cite causes an solutions.

## That is aspects of the simulacra

Avoidance of goodness. As if declaring Nazi Germany 1933 is all that is needed and someone else should fix it, like D-Day Normaady Beach Landing to rescue the USA.

There isn't a focus on:

1. Morality teaching. What is good, what is bad, understanding goodness itself.
2. Clergy's job being to teach God above the WHOLE Earth, compassion and goodness. And no more out-group hate ( The 1954 Equation )
3. Without love, without compassion, relationships are not very good. If all people care about is "made in USA" label on consumerism goods, without love, without compassion - what's the point?
4. Isrel year 2024 (all year) has had the attitude that "we do not need the love and compassion of Palstine people, it is not worth the trouble" - and this attitude is the USA attitude - that love and compassion are non-essential to society and living as a human person.
5. The Flag, The Constituion does not have "love thy neighbor" (Mexico, Liberal, Conservative, other states), "love thy enemy" (Russia, which in this case love means teaching them morality lessons, being serious about teaching them Malala and MLK Jr, call to intellectual arms).

Practical social media observations absent, sillloute void:

1. Too much hate, not enough love. Love is important.
2. Too much dehumanization, focus on systemic processe, not enough compassion for human persons.
3. Too much technology and speed, not enough compassion and love. (1940 Great Dictator Speech expresses this, for example)
