# Social Media Did Not June 2025

Sustained, focused, persistent, repeating.

What I see and witness


1. "They are Nazi Germany"
2. "They are Hitler"
3. "They are in Germany 1933, they are Nazi Germans"

What I do not see and witness:

1. "MLK Jr was correct, what he had to say on topic x"
2. "Neil Postman was correct, what he had to say on topic y of Twitter and Facebook and Fox News"

&nbsp;

## Recency Bias Abounds

People can repeat 1933 Nazi Germany, can repeat holocaust, can repeat genocide, but can not assert goodness or cite causes an solutions.

## That is aspects of the simulacra

Avoidance of goodness. As if declaring Nazi Germany 1933 is all that is needed and someone else should fix it, like D-Day Normandy Beach Landing to rescue the USA.

There isn't a focus on:

1. Morality teaching. What is good, what is bad, understanding goodness itself.
2. Clergy's job being to teach God above the WHOLE Earth, compassion and goodness. And no more out-group hate ( The 1954 Equation )
3. Without love, without compassion, relationships are not very good. If all people care about is "made in USA" label on consumerism goods, without love, without compassion - what's the point?
4. Israel year 2024 (all year) has had the attitude that "we do not need the love and compassion of Palestine people, it is not worth the trouble" - and this attitude is the USA attitude - that love and compassion are non-essential to society and living as a human person.
5. The Flag, The Constitution does not have "love thy neighbor" (Mexico, Liberal, Conservative, other states), "love thy enemy" (Russia, which in this case love means teaching them morality lessons, being serious about teaching them Malala and MLK Jr, call to intellectual arms).

&nbsp;

Practical social media observations absent, silhouette void:

1. Too much hate, not enough love. Love is important.
2. Too much dehumanization, focus on systemic process, not enough compassion for human persons.
3. Too much technology and speed, not enough compassion and love. (1940 Great Dictator Speech expresses this, for example)

Social media could do...

1. Repeat Dr. Bandy X Lee name and her Bluesky account link over and over until she has 10 million followers instead of 3,000

2. Repeat this link more than "Epstein" name over and over. quote sentences from the story.

"Isn’t Trump’s Obvious Mental Illness a National Emergency?"

More Monday night:

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1q54vk8/dont_stop_talking_about_the_epstein_files/

It is as if people can't make a real "copypasta", a copy-mix of critical important topics. From 2 to 5 topics in one paragraph.

EXAMPLE: Epstein abusing girls, Dr. Bandy X. Lee on organizing mental health workers. Internet Research Agency has manipulated minds. Jen Senko's film about right-wing media. Every 47 hours "Brainrot 47" group meets online to organize intellectual education and teaching instead of just complaining about Fox News and WWE Education. Please don't stop avoiding the root causes of problems.
