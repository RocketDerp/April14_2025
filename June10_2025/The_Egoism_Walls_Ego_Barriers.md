# The Egoism Walls

The Egoism barriers. Ego walls. Egoism walls. Egomania defensive.
Defensive for egomania. 

&nbsp;

The 1954 Equaiton from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Is it fun to watch others suffer across the world?  

Marshall McLuhan's equation about civil war.

"The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own."

&nbsp;

Is it enjoyable that people suffer on the *bad side of town*, the *bad side of the tracks* metaphors? Fun, enjoyable the compeittive one-upmanship? Not just wealth, but also: red tape, paperwork, complexity systems that prevent people from having goodness itself.

Is sharing not rewarding to people? Is sharing not fun?

Neil Postman: "Public education does not serve a public. It creates a public. And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens?" - September 1995, already into Eternal September
