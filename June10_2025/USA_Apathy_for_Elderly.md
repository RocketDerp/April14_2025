Symptoms and signs since March 2013 start of "Operation Matthew 4:19"

1. "Too Much Fox News", "Things like Fox News are bad", "Neil Postman was Correct in 1985", "Andrew Post confirmed the crisis in February 2017 about Fox News". "We need a sustained focused contuing society discussion abut the Fox News and Rush Limbaugh Problem", "Jen Senko raises good points".

2. Pandemic outbreak and all the anti-science was EVERYONE in USA facing the crisis, seeing the evidence. Elon Musk predicting it would be over in April 2020 (March 19, 2020 prediction), Donald Trump saying it was short-term and over. Nobody quoting books or discussing 1918 pandemic being skipped in schools, common knowledge, re-asserting books. Horse paste. Nobody re-assering the August 24, 2018 Russian information warfare from John Hopkins Unversity & George Washington Unversity.

# Small Time media voice

Stand up for the Little Guy, the Little Gal. The elderly crisis.

Social media has acted like Jen Senko is not good enough, Michael Moore not good enough. Al Gore too. There isn't admitting to failure to take what is good and build upon it, amend it.

# Media Ecology Corps / Goodness Corps

Those trained on Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan have not made this a "call to arms", "repeating alarm", "repeating and repeating cries for help".

Emphasis on context: This is BEFORE Joe Biden dropped out, Donald Trump assisnation attempt at campaign public podium, before Kamala Harris became POTUS candidate.

People are not standing up for this, recognizing it. It is a tree tree tree and no recognizition of the Neil Postman articulated forest.

# Media Educated, Media Practitioner Corps

## Media Defense Comprehension

1. James Joyce (Dublin Ireland) perspective, "History is a Nightmare"

2. Marshall McLuhann (University of Toronto) on James Joyce

3. Bill Moyers (White House) and Joseph Campbell (Sarah Lawrence College) persctive on world history of religions. Campbell marriage on James Joyce (Jean and Joseph both Joyceans). Summer of 1987 statement on Levant religions (Torah, Bible, Quran clergy as there were) disqualified for the future. Harsh owning up to the crisis of media ecology, fiction vs. nonfiction metaphor crisis.

The lack of perspective on Japan 1943 and Germany 1933 mind-sets, media interpreattion, values, and morality. Psychology of mass psychosis. Mob mentality.

# Outbreaks of mob mentality

# Fire drills, disaster drills, response drills of mobs

It could be said that the pandemic would inspire outing mobs, and one such happened on the world stage for Halloween

Why did the entire world not make education on how to prevent this? Why doesn't Saudi Arabis with Mecca crush?

This is Malala's point - what fucking good is the religon when we can't actually use organized religion to promote compassion, love, **goodness itself**?
