Symptoms and signs since March 2013 start of "Operation Matthew 4:19"

1. "Too Much Fox News", "Things like Fox News are bad", "Neil Postman was Correct in 1985", "Andrew Post confirmed the crisis in February 2017 about Fox News". "We need a sustained focused contuing society discussion abut the Fox News and Rush Limbaugh Problem", "Jen Senko raises good points".

2. Pandemic outbreak and all the anti-science was EVERYONE in USA facing the crisis, seeing the evidence. Elon Musk predicting it would be over in April 2020 (March 19, 2020 prediction), Donald Trump saying it was short-term and over. Nobody quoting books or discussing 1918 pandemic being skipped in schools, common knowledge, re-asserting books. Horse paste. Nobody re-assering the August 24, 2018 Russian information warfare from John Hopkins Unversity & George Washington Unversity.

Stand up for the Little Guy, the Little Gal. The elderly crisis.

Social media has acted like Jen Senko is not good enough, Michael Moore not good enough. Al Gore too. There isn't admitting to failure to take what is good and build upon it, amend it.
