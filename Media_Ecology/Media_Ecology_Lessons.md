### Year 2013 capability of audio engineering

### Politics is fiction games 

Fiction outsells nonfiction. By adding more fiction to government, more adventure and "choose your own reality", popularity increases. Popularity yields more name recognition and voting and power, both soft power (celebrity fame) and hard power. [Everything is media ecology](Everything_is_ME.md).

ToDo: Look for postings in other subreddits that might get more engagement.

&nbsp;

### The comedy venue

The late-night after-hours forbidden anti-Church.   
Well, the Church speaks of Hell and sin, which is dark, and Church promotes that Heaven and Eden are good and Earth is bad (media ecology of planets, outer space).  
Truth to power. Avoidance of truth. Egoism. 
Getting fired for criticizing those in power, getting paid and popularity for criticizing (the comedian).

August 2, 2025 front page of Reddit social media    
Title: "Bill Burr goes after Billionaires, ‘Horrible racist‘ Conservatives, ‘Treasonous idiot‘ Ben Shapiro, and ‘Disease‘ Fox News"     
https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1mfe87g/bill_burr_goes_after_billionaires_horrible_racist/

Does this create a simulacra of resistance?   
Proxy of saying what people will not stand up in democracy (population, We The People) and say?   
Is he CALLING on the audience to have bravery and courage to repeat what is being said, or just satiating the inner desire and creating spectators / passive office (See Rick Roderick "Self Under Siege" lectures which touches on this media ecology topics of spectacle media consumers)

&nbsp;

### Pleasing to audience, animals 

Animal content is huge in modern audiences. Kitten and puppy photos. In the 1970's posting wtih an automobile was hot, but now it is posing in a photograph with an animal.

### Sports Mentality

Reddit posting front page top: Michelle Obama cooks ESPN: "If I watch ESPN for an hour it's like watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It's the same drama, they're yelling at each other, they don't get along. Stephen A. Smith would be a great Real Housewife. What's the difference? It's just drama."

Media ecology discussion assignment: Rectangle simulacra, armies of medical doctors servicing the ultra rich for entertainment. They could be traveling the world building hospitals, these athletic supermen, but people want fiction framed rectangle screens and rectangle FIFA / NBA / NFL. Why not watch children play in the neighborhood and have exercise and make real world friendship, why are people only interested in rich people's lives? Mythological gods?

&nbsp;

### Faulty Notification Technology?

https://old.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1mftfz5/terrible_notification_to_get_on_take_off/

Media ecology discussion topic: Study the comments here about experiences getting faulty notifications.  Deeper... did the person spreading this on Reddit just want a discussion, have flight anxiety or lost bag anxiety, and wanted to share... did they likely know that the indicator may be faulty? Is it like car drivers complaining about weather or traffic, despite being a routine topic, just as conversation starters?

&nbsp;

### Ban / Block

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mfwflr/trumps_media_takeover_isnt_about_bias_its_about/

**"Trump's Media Takeover Isn't About Bias, It's About Silencing Dissent"**

Social media has given every person a taste of leveraged machine power: banning people, blocking people. No need to burn physical books on paper like 1930's Nazi Germany... the block button doesn't require flame and paper. Egoism / egomania / echo chambers / [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble). Silencing and grey-rocking those who dissent.  Since October 8, 2013 - Malala has been routinely grey-rocked by social media users - she provides non-fiction content of progressive reformation. Malala's sincere non-fiction is popular in the rise of Donald Trump / MAGA / Putin invasion of Ukraine (February 2014 onward). What's wrong with what Malala Yousafzai has to say? It doesn't go with the flow of using powerful machines to dehumanize and block and silence those in "the others" groups. Donald Trump and [Radio Mullah media behavior](https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/Malala%2038-65.pdf) follow the same year 2012 onward trajectory. People are not willing to face up that what Donald Trump is doing, blocking and silencing people he disagrees with, is commonplace in Bluesky social media year 2024, Reddit social media, etc. Marshall McLuhan educated society about this, such as [this 1977 interview on television: "all forms of violence are a quest for (Text sourced from https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus) identity. When you live out on the frontier, you have no identity. You’re a nobody. Therefore, you get very tough. You have to prove that you are somebody. And so you become very violent. And so identity is always accompanied by violence. This seems paradoxical to you? That ordinary, ordinary people find the need for violence as they lose their identities. So it’s only the threat to people’s identity that makes them — terrorists, hijackers: these are people minus identity. They are determined to make it somehow, to get coverage, to get noticed."](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus)

If people can not even share Unicode messages on computer without burning books / blocking each other, what hope does humanity have for traveling in the same airports together, sharing a cinema together, sharing a sports stadium, sharing a city, eating next to each other ([breaking bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_us_break_bread_together) together). People praise the block button (book burning, silencing of what they disagree with in modern digital forms) as "fixing" the egomania and aggression issues. Machines are not fixing the human problems, people are blocking it out, a form of psychological denial that world peace is not *optional*.

* "The wise saying, "The pen is mightier than sword” was true. **The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them**." - July 12, 2013. Malala Yousafzai: 16th birthday speech.

Highlight 1: the experience of waiting two full months to get corrections to a mistake in the printing / instructions... and having to pay money for the magazine issue with corrections.  

Highlight 2: YouTube community comments such as "Typing in programs like this is why I can type so fast and accurately today. It was the BEST typing tutor! :)" are worth a glance.

Is he (Charles Cornell) [gullible how much](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/19/musk-ackman-election-misinformation) wealth goes into Superbowl media advertising? Is this how earworms are implanted, older target demographic with wealth who knows the song would have it lodged in their mind. That's the themes of Media Ecology of Finnegans Wake, ("Earwicker" is the name of the character, "Earworm" meme themes, Bible verse John 1:1 earworms).

Is this a form of mental exploit. to subconsciously lodge it into the minds? Isn't that the very foundation of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake story... *Wake Up, Woke, Woke to media ecology*? "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

### Neil Postman on technology

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbAPtGYiRvg

0:12

um the tendency in uh American culture to turn over to technology sovereignty command control uh over all of our social institutions in other words the book is about how um America has uh developed a new religion as it were uh and the religion is its faith in U that uh human progress and technological innovation are the same thing and that paradise can be achieved through greater and greater commitment uh to technology 

0:55 

what is technology well I have to Define it in the book or rather broadly because not only do I include Machinery like television and uh computers and all that
but also techniques uh I call them invisible Technologies because most people don't
think of them as a a sort of Machinery but things like statistics and polling
and um uh uh bureaucratic forms
any um uh systematic and repeatable
technique that tends to cause people to
uh constrain their thinking about the
world we talked a number of years ago
about
television um what impact is technology

1:50
having on television and what's what's
1:52
the impact on the
1:54
country well one of the reasons Brian
1:57
that I I felt I did this but is that the
2:00
the last time we talked as you suggest
2:04
uh was about a book that was almost
2:06
wholly devoted to television and when I
2:09
started to uh think about that issue I
2:13
realized that you couldn't get a a an
2:16
accurate handle on uh what we Americans
2:20
were all about by focusing on one medium
2:23
that that you had to see television as
2:27
part of a kind of um
2:30
system of techniques and technologies
2:34
that are giving the shape uh to our
2:37
culture for instance um if one wants to
2:40
think about what has happened to public
2:42
life in
2:43
America uh and U one has to think of
2:47
course first about television but also
2:50
about CDs and also about um
2:55
uh all sorts of faxes and telephones and
3:01
all of the Machinery that that takes
3:03
people out of public
3:06
Arenas and keeps them fixed in their
3:09
homes so that we have a kind of
3:12
privatization of American life and one
3:15
here is people say with some
3:18
considerable enthusiasm that in the
3:20
future uh putting television computers
3:23
and the telephone together people will
3:26
be able to shop at home vote at home
3:29
home uh do every Express uh political
3:33
preferences in in many ways at home so
3:36
that they never have to go out in the
3:38
street at all and never have to meet their fellow citizens in any context because we'd have this Ensemble of Technologies uh that keep us private away from from citizens in fact I think uh Ry Peru's idea of a town meeting uh is a new kind of definition of town meeting because it doesn't imply co-presence uh of people he wants to do it via Electronic media so that uh television and as well as other

4:17

Technologies redefine all sorts of things I mean television uh has redefined uh as I think we talked about last time what we mean by a public debate that uh we used to use uh the Lincoln Douglas debates as an example as kind of model or metaphor of what we mean by uh political debate uh these debates would go on for hours television has redefined it so now the two or possibly three candidates stand in front of the television camera and each one is given two minutes to respond to a very difficult question and uh the opponent is given 60 seconds

5:03

to reply now we still call this a debate uh but it's a redefinition of of that term and uh uh Rose perau suggestion that we use television as a form of uh a town meeting is another redefinition of what we once met by town meeting so that the one of the most interesting things about technology is that it redefines our language it it gives us different meanings uh of older words and very often we're not quite uh as aware as we should be of how that process is working good or bad well in this book I mostly emphasize

5:53

the bad part uh I've done that in most of my books but I owe I I admit and uh happily at the beginning of the book that anyone who um uh looks at technology as an either or development

Is use of the Internet causing us to lose the ability to concentrate and think deeply? Drawing from philosophy, neuroscience, and history, "The Shallows" explores how the Internet may be rerouting neural pathways."

### Work Media Ecology of Information Age

I personally have worked from home since August 1999. Home has included home office in South America, Africa, Middle East, Malaysia, Indonesia and RV all over the USA (8 different RV sizes and shapes). With my wife and solo after divorce.    
Lesson focus:   
1. Is work office culture the same in 1975 vs. 1995 vs 2025?
2. pandemic COVID-19 changes
3. Is work office same in different nations, rural vs. city, other geographic differences.
4. Work hours culture, work days culture. Muslims have their Friday night on Thursday night and do not work on Friday and start week on Sunday in several nations I have lived in.  In Chile in South America, people were used to long work hours and staying up late was more routine.  Japan is famous for after-work obligations for salarymen.
5. Contractors vs. employees and expectations.
6. Jobs that can't possibly be work from home: delivery person, repair person, installation, construction, waiters, drivers, pilots, cleaners, physical labor in factory, fresh food preparations, etc, etc.
7. Working with your spouse and children around during summer school breaks.
8. Vacations and working 'on call' even when on paid holiday.

### Propietary Hardware

The Steam Deck isn't open hardware (confirm that claim?).

Android vs. Apple devices. Apple own't allow Apple operating system to run on non-apple software in almost all cases and has found huge success in selling hardware and software married into a single package. Consumers often try to think of content/software as "free" and selling it inside a "gadget" with specific buttons tends to make more sales / profit. Long history of this in the elctronics industry from the very start. General purpose tools confuse people.

Hardware DRM / anti-piracy / unique hardware such as Nintendo 64 console cartridges that were not compatible with any of existing system.

Microsoft had plenty of anti-compettive issues in the software, the argument can be made that they sabotaged their parterm IBM with OS/2 while developing Windows NT (IBM PC-DOS, Microsot MS-DOS had two companies with source code rihts. IBM OS/2 and Microsoft OS/2 would have been two companies with source code more like how hardware chips are often fabricated by competing companeis to have second-source).... starting sentence over. The one thing Microsoft DID give us compared to Apple - was a far more open chocie of personal computer hardware. Things like supporter printers, supported optical drives, support WiFi hardware, Ethernet network adapters, graphics ccards (GPU chips), etc that Apple's more closed sysem didn't encourage. You can get Windows laptops with every size screen and keyboard imaginable, where with Apple that choice is much more limited. nd you can't run Apple apps on a Windows system easily (or run into legal restrictions / licensing restrictions with the app store). NEEDS EDITING. As does everything. 

Nintendo is really bit on propritary hardware married to their game software. Also on their use game ROM on software emulators. Although there are somteimes open standards used, such as the Nintendo Wii remotes working with Linux Bluetooth conventions.

"But some people did not love Elvis — older people who did not appreciate his hip-swigging new music. Parker began to sell “I Hate Elvis” buttons so he could make money either way. The only button he didn’t sell was something saying, “I feel ambivalent about Elvis.” In a book titled ‘Colonel (The True Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley),’ author Alanna Nash mentions the badges."

### The Message Crashes Your Brain

Being able to fake voice calls and text messages to loved ones to declare someone was killed. Especially if some labor goes into matching it up to a airport trip or train trip or ocean crossing where a lot of conditoined society anxiety media exists.

Being able to fake evidence of an affair / cheating at a job or in a intimate relationshp.

A music video going vial from South Korea, which was not known for world music industry like "The Brish Invasion" of The Beatles world wide or Michael Jackson USA world wide, etc.

Content that alters states of mind.

Questions for media ecology students to ponder:

1. What year was the song published?
2. What year was the video recorded?
3. What year was the upload to YouTube video platform?
4. What year was YouTube well known and recognized by media experts in music publishing?
5. How many backup copies of the recording of the video did they keep?

Ponder: How much money the music publisher makes vs. artist... and they let the copies corrupt and nobody had a backup copy?

Pay attention to the YouTube upload dates of famous acts. Songs not published for years and years after YouTube was famous. It cost next to nothing to upload the song to YouTube, a couple hours of labor. Why not until December 4, 2018? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnEBSY3leQQ "℗ 1978 Geffen Records.

“Joyce is, in the Wake, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its **basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology**. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of tribal institutions can return in the electric age, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.”
— Marshall McLuhan, see also “Address at Vision 65” , p. 7

### Information scams

Telephone and text message scams. The phone networks are regulated by the government for a hundred years, but predatory businesses and money making scemes can't be stopped. There are not that many telecom companies at the back-end (many branding front-ends for marketing and pricing) - this is not impossible to regulate. Yet it goes on for decade after decade. Creating a peer to peer hostility in society. Absuve information system usage. People who tolerate abusive relationships, predators, manipulators, "settle for", who would criticize in a personal romance relationship at family / friends level - entirely allow it at the soiety-wide national level.

Measuring and numbers.  Tower of Babel tower climbing conflict experiences.

Language of time is 60 minutes is a full hour. Language of USA currency is that 25 cents is one quarter, one of four, to 100 cents, one full dollar. So mixing one quarter of an hour with one quater of a dollar exposes a mental junction of thnking. The measurement of time units vs. measurement of money.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HEjeMBNcm8

A business, The Eagles bussinessmen, that has a reputaiton for copyright abuse and in-fighting over wealth and royalty and credits and greed over publication. Which is the very topic of the song itself, "water into wine", no - turning songs into cash and keeping it off youtube for HOW MANY YEARS? Since year 1974, it took until year 2025 LATE, LATE YEAR 2025, to offically upload to YouTube?

"39,130 views  August 29, 2025    
Official Audio for "On the Border" performed by the Eagles. Original song from 'On the Border' (1974)."

"All the royalty and copyright fighting - took you from 1974 to LATE August 2025 to finally upload to YouTube. How many lawyers argued and argued and argued and argued. Lyrics: "change this water into wine", sure turning your song into lawyer wealth. Corporate America businessmen at their worst.  Don't make music for fans, make music to argue and debate with your fellow businessmen over logic of sharing wealth and copyright fame. You are not turning water into wine with that egoism. Your lawyers copyright law and order, yha. Go read Bible verse "1 John 3:17", you old men."

1995 review from Roger Ebert (when he was still alive)    
https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/scream-1996    
Today 2025-11-02

1. "they went to the movies in “TheLast Picture Show” and the heroes"

2. "Insteadof leaving it to the audience to anticipate the horror clichés"

3. "But those movies were about the \*act\* ofgoing to the movies."

Regarding number 3, are the asterisks intentional or supposed to be italic / underline? There are a huge number of spacing problems in this story. "Roger Ebert's estate was worth approximately
$9 million at the time of his death in 2013." Were these old 1990's reviews published on the website when he was still alive in year 2013 or earlier? 

Also consider that halloween films tend to get passed down for holiday rewatch... and people may pass down their favorite reviewer. So there is sill an audience for a 1996 film review. Somewhat sad that such glaring publishing mistakes are not cleaned up for Halloween 2025.

### You can't photograph the monster

I made a horror game that's IMPOSSIBLE to SCREENSHOT!        
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNhiT-SmR1Q

Motion itself being often how humans and other animals on planet Earth detect a threat / predator. Camouflage in fur / feathers / clothing / fish colour and shapes... and without movement, a still photograph, people can't spot the movement of the threat. Ambush or "sit-and-wait" predators, where immobility is key to their hunting strategy.

"Terrestrial examples include leopards and jaguars, whose spotted coats blend into dappled light; owls with mottled feathers mimicking tree bark; the masquerading praying mantis and crab spider that resemble flora; chameleons that alter their appearance to match surroundings; and vine snakes that mimic branches. In aquatic environments, mastery of camouflage is evident in octopuses and cuttlefish, which dynamically change their skin pattern and texture; the highly venomous stonefish and scorpionfish that blend perfectly with the seafloor; frogfish that use a lure while remaining hidden; the well-camouflaged alligator snapping turtle; and the flattened, fringed tasselled wobbegong shark. All these species rely heavily on immobility and effective disguise to facilitate their ambush hunting strategies."

"It's a relatively common thing in media that "reality is unrealistic." Accurately showing Nazi criminals verges so far into absurdly, insanely, obviously evil and horrible actions that it comes off as a parody of how you'd criticize your enemies rather than an accurate depiction of their crimes. You risk breaking suspension of disbelief because the horrors inflicted on people by Nazi Germany were so beyond the pale that they go into cartoonish self-parody."

"You said what I meant more clearly. Movie Amon already comes close to cartoonishly evil, but good acting and writing keeps his normal human qualities in view. In my opinion, this makes the character even more sinister, because it allows the possibility that "anyone" could be like Amon, given the "wrong" circumstances and choices.

At the same time, Schindler's character shows how, even if your whole life you've basically been a crook, that you can choose to be good and do good things. A spying, womanizing, drunk, corrupt war profiteer like Schindler ends up crying while giving the literal clothes from his back to the people he risked his life to protect through the war? I've seen the move probably 10 times by now, that last scene still gets me."

### F.M. Radio

F.M. Radio for music, sports, entertainment.

The range is not very long. Typically 80 miles or less on a car radio / portable radio. Often only 40 miles in expereince. Even worse inside houses / office buildings. They would cut out.

You would not be able to listen in USA to London F.M. radio. Same with broadcast television. The antenna built into a portable television set, "rabit ears", could not pick up teleivision from a city 150 miles away.

What this means for this lesson: a radio made in Japan and sold to the USA consumer in year 1971 would have channels / frequencies that are not the same all across the world. So carrying that radio on a vacation or business trip could result in it being useless to listen to music or such in other nations.

The inner world is the world of your requirements and your energies and your structure and your possibilities that meets the outer world. And the outer world is the field of your incarnation. That’s where you are. You’ve got to keep both going. As Novalis said, “The seat of the soul is there where the inner and outer worlds meet.” - age 83 Sarah Lawrence College professor

# USA values: Confusing the elderly with messages

Predatory marketing, agressive messaging targeting people with money.

https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1pjco79/they_never_stop/

The young people in society do not vote to protect the elderly and use technology to track down these predators. The mobile phone networks have the money to identify it, but they don't do it. Same with junk mail and postal system in USA society. Profit-seeking with scams and exploitation are encouraged by media networks of postal delivery and telephone delivery an even YouTube, etc. "Elsa Gate" on YouTube, for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsagate

# Year 1776 language reading

Language has changed dramatically since year 1776

https://old.reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/1pmlpx2/youve_read_the_entire_thing/

"left" and "right", very basic English words used daily by people to indicate direction, have entirely changed meaning since year 1789. And monoarcy supporters would not be the USA, which was anti-monarchy intetionally. "monarchist supporters preferring tradition sitting to the right"

So declaring "it is remarkably short" and "I have read it" does not demonstrate comprehension or understanding of the langauge issues. This is why the Great Seal of the United States of America was created - about *interprtation and understanding* sklls. Printed all over the place on the Dollar Bill currency. The pyramid with the eye at top. The pyramid on the Nile river, and intentional references to the Library of Alexandria at higher steps of the pyramid. Without knowing the history of Tower of Babel and langauge itself in Bible verse John 1:1 - understanding and comprehension via The Great Seal of the Untied States of America age 21 art and metaphor literacy education. Without that, reading words is likely to yeild substanial errors and misunderstandings.

# White Supremacy Body Types   

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1pomtnm/what_happened_to_real_faces_on_screen/

The issue was articulated and identified in 1985 as trending

The video clip on Reddit mentions "white supremacy", a valid topic in December 2025 Reddit USA / Hollywood USA.

* “Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they **argue with good looks, celebrities** and commercials.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985

* "been sucked into this system of images and so on. Now this sounds extreme but think of how we are **socialised** – all of us – **continually bombarded with images** from magazines, TVs, newspapers, videotapes." - Rick Roderick 1993 https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

* "I think that one of the greatest examples of this – for me – is the discourse concerning body weight in women; bulimia, anorexia and so on. It’s as though a male dominant society was able in the Middle Ages to, you know, put a chastity belt on a woman, to put, you know, to… keep food away from her and starve her if she misbehaved. But today we accomplish the same feat **through images that are constantly bombarded** into the conscious and into the unconscious of women, and they perform the wonderfully humanistic task of starving themselves to death while male therapists teach them how to get on twelve step programs to eat." - Rick Roderick 1993 https://rickroderick.org/306-foucault-and-the-disappearance-of-the-human-1993/

USA health care system favors wealthy competition over appearances. Not inclusion for all people. This is the underlying reason so many billionaires are investing in artificial intelligence capable of generating images. The demand for "good looks" exceeds any demand for normalcy. Ugly people are considered worthless in such a society. Ugly people are treated almost as if another kind of animal / species on Earth. Images and every social device having a camera / photographs with touch-up enhancement digital abilities.

The whole change to be famous - is also somethings not always looked at. These women would not be world famous / staring roles if they did not do everything they could to compete on superficial and shallow beauty standard. Audiences and popularity / attraction to selling their content and images.

# Bitpattern Purple

https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1pvnncw/themoreyouknow/

It is Christmas day as I do this Git Commit. December 25, 2025 Thursday.  

My my reckoning, Reddit society (the link context here in this media ecology lesson authored on Christmas Day in USA). doesn't memorialize goodness much at all.

"Aaron Swartz, a co-founder of Reddit and a prominent internet activist, died by suicide on January 11, 2013, at the age of 26. He was found in his Brooklyn apartment by his girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman." - Copyright is Brain Damage Ted Talk by Nina Paley came out not much longer. ""Copyright is Brain Damage" is a 2015 TEDxMaastricht talk by Nina Paley, an American cartoonist, animator, and free culture activist." ... "Swartz’s focus: He fought against "paywalls" for human knowledge and political censorship (like SOPA)."

Good news is I'm here to stir the pot of Christmas metaphors and wonder if the Bible had copyright and paywalls how popular that story would be? 

* "The Trash Stratum: The protagonist, Horselover Fat (a fictionalized version of Dick himself), believes that the "Empire" (the repressive Roman reality he believes we are still living in) hides the divine from us. He concludes that God communicates through "junk"—low-level pop culture, discarded items, and profane imagery."

*  The phrase "THE VIRGIN MARY HAD STRETCH MARKS" is the opening sentence of Philip K. Dick's 1981 novel The Divine Invasion.

The Word of Jesus is out now, that's a media ecology study.

* Rick Roderick 1993: "a book in the sixties called “The Society of the Spectacle“. And what it was about, was about how when capitalism reached a certain level of accumulation, commodities began to **detach themselves and become images**. And citizens who formerly had played roles as political actors began to **detach themselves from their own lives and become spectators**." https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

* NYU Neil Postman's 1985 book: “In courtrooms, classrooms, operating rooms, board rooms, churches and even airplanes, Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, **they exchange images**. They do not argue with propositions; **they argue with good looks**, celebrities and commercials.” ― [Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

# Celebration of Jargon

The 1978 film "Convoy" is a celebration of language jargon. Street gangs of machine transportation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy_(1978_film)    
Wednesday, June 28, 1978   
Japan got film release weeks before USA, they loved USA content and **wild west** Arizona opening themes.   
"The truckers drive across Arizona and New Mexico"   

I was so inspired by this movie at age 9, I got a CB Radio in Fort Wayne, Indiana - my first social media communications system at age 13 / Christmas 1982 Radio Shack with a 2-story high base antenna on the side of my upstairs bedroom. Fort Wayne is a trucking hub. *International Harvester (IH) plant, North American Van Lines*

The film really celebrates the common medium of channel 19 public messaging. You had to have a license back then in 1978 (my license is "KBRV0896") to use social media. They deregulated and opened social media up to anyone. My 40 channel citizen band radio experience inspired me to program an original from-scratch BBS (Bulletin Board System, Public Messaging) system for the Commodore 128 computer with "subreedits" like categories for the "40  public channels" over telephone dial-up modems. I sold the software commercially in 1985. "ZBBS", "The Fortress", "219 area code".

I also had a battery-operated Walkie Talkie, also a Radio Shack. Adults in the Fort Wayne area where nice to me as a child, helped me out with radio hardware (my family knew nothing). Traded equipment / used deals at times. My username was "Big Red" because my father worked in soda business and I liked that style of soda. Some of the adults thought it meant I was a red-head child, but that was my older brother, I was blonde and blue eyed.
