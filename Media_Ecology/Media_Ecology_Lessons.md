### Politics is fiction games 

Fiction outsells nonfiction. By adding more fiction to government, more adventure and "choose your own reality", popularity increases. Popularity yields more name recognition and voting and power, both soft power (celebrity fame) and hard power. [Everything is media ecology](Everything_is_ME.md).

ToDo: Look for postings in other subreddits that might get more engagement.

&nbsp;

### The comedy venue

The late-night after-hours forbidden anti-Church.   
Well, the Church speaks of Hell and sin, which is dark, and Church promotes that Heaven and Eden are good and Earth is bad (media ecology of planets, outer space).  
Truth to power. Avoidance of truth. Egoism. 
Getting fired for criticizing those in power, getting paid and popularity for criticizing (the comedian).

August 2, 2025 front page of Reddit social media    
Title: "Bill Burr goes after Billionaires, ‘Horrible racist‘ Conservatives, ‘Treasonous idiot‘ Ben Shapiro, and ‘Disease‘ Fox News"     
https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1mfe87g/bill_burr_goes_after_billionaires_horrible_racist/

Does this create a simulacra of resistance?   
Proxy of saying what people will not stand up in democracy (population, We The People) and say?   
Is he CALLING on the audience to have bravery and courage to repeat what is beinng said, or just satiating the inner desire and creating spectators / passive office (See Rick Roderick "Self Under Siege" lectures which touches on this media ecology topicc of spectacle media consumers)

&nbsp;

### Pleasing to audience, animals 

Animal content is huge in modern audiences. Kitten and puppy photos. In the 1970's posting wtih an automobile was hot, but now it is posing in a photograph with an animal.

### Sports Mentalty

Reddit posting front page top: Michelle Obama cooks ESPN: "If I watch ESPN for an hour it's like watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It's the same drama, they're yelling at each other, they don't get along. Stephen A. Smith would be a great Real Housewife. What's the difference? It's just drama."

Media ecology discussion assignment: Rectangle simulacra, armies of medical doctors servicing the ultra rich for entertainment. They could be traveling the world building hospitals, these athletic superment, but people want fiction framed rectangle screens and rectangle FIFA / NBA / NFL. Why not watch children play in the neighborhood and have exercise and make real world friendship, why are people only interested in rich people's lives? Mhythological gods?

&nbsp;

### Faulty Notification Technology?

https://old.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1mftfz5/terrible_notification_to_get_on_take_off/

Media ecology discussion topic: Study the comments here about experiences getting faulty notifications.  Deeper... did the person spreading this on Reddit just want a discussion, have flight anxiety or lost bag anxiety, and wanted to share... did they likley know that the indicator may be faulty? Is it like car drivers complaining about weather or traffic, despite being a routine topic, just as conversation starters?

&nbsp;

### Ban / Block

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mfwflr/trumps_media_takeover_isnt_about_bias_its_about/

**"Trump's Media Takeover Isn't About Bias, It's About Silencing Dissent"**

Social media has given every person a taste of leveraged machine power: banning people, blocking people. No need to burn physical books on paper like 1930's Nazi Germany... the block button doesn't require flame and paper. Egoism / egomania / echo chambers / [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble). Silencing and grey-rocking those who dissent.  Since October 8, 2013 - Malala has been routinely grey-rocked by social media users - she provides non-fiction content of progressive reformation. Malala's sincere non-fiction is popular in the rise of Donald Trump / MAGA / Putin invasion of Ukraine (February 2014 onward). What's wrong with what Malala Yousafzai has to say? It doesn't go with the flow of using powerful machines to dehumanize and block and silence those in "the others" groups. Donald Trump and [Radio Mullah media behavior](https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/Malala%2038-65.pdf) follow the same year 2012 onward trajectory. People are not willing to face up that what Donald Trump is doing, blocking and silencing people he disagrees with, is commonplace in Bluesky social media year 2024, Reddit social media, etc. Marshall McLuhan educated society about this, such as [this 1977 interview on television: "all forms of violence are a quest for (Text sourced from https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus) identity. When you live out on the frontier, you have no identity. You’re a nobody. Therefore, you get very tough. You have to prove that you are somebody. And so you become very violent. And so identity is always accompanied by violence. This seems paradoxical to you? That ordinary, ordinary people find the need for violence as they lose their identities. So it’s only the threat to people’s identity that makes them — terrorists, hijackers: these are people minus identity. They are determined to make it somehow, to get coverage, to get noticed."](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus)

If people can not even share unicode messages on computer without burning books / blocking each other, what hope does humanity have for traveling in the same airports together, sharing a cinema together, sharing a sports stadium, sharing a city, eating next to each other ([breaking bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_us_break_bread_together) together). People praise the block button (book burning, silencing of what they disagree with in modern digital forms) as "fixing" the egomania and agression issues. Machines are not fixing the human problems, people are blocking it out, a form of phychological denial that world peace is not *optional*.

* "The wise saying, "The pen is mightier than sword” was true. **The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them**." - July 12, 2013. Malala Yousafzai: 16th birthday speech.

Highlight 1: the experience of waiting two full months to get corrections to a mistake in the printing / instructions... and having to pay money for the magazine issue with corrections.  

Highlight 2: YouTube community comments such as "Typing in programs like this is why I can type so fast and accurately today. It was the BEST typing tutor! :)" are worth a glance.

### Intentional earworm via distortion / bug

"They Ruined One Of The Greatest Songs Ever Written"   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQcymjDarNs   

Is he (Charles Cornell) [gullible how much](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/19/musk-ackman-election-misinformation) wealth goes into Superbowl media advertising? Is this how earworms are implanted, older target demographic with wealth who knows the song would have it lodged in their mind. That's the themes of Media Ecology of Finnegans Wake, ("Earwicker" is the name of the character, "Earworm" meme themes, Bible verse John 1:1 earworms).

Is this a form of mental exploit. to subconsciously lodge it into the minds? Isn't that the very foundation of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake story... *Wake Up, Woke, Woke to media ecology*? "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

Title: TIL that in 1984, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith heard a song on the radio. Tyler liked it and told Perry that they should do a cover version. Perry turned to Tyler and said "That's us, fuckhead." Tyler's didn't remember writing or performing their '75 song "You See Me Crying"

### Neil Postman on technology

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbAPtGYiRvg

0:12

um the tendency in uh American culture to turn over to technology sovereignty command control uh over all of our social institutions in other words the book is about how um America has uh developed a new religion as it were uh and the religion is its faith in U that uh human progress and technological innovation are the same thing and that paradise can be achieved through greater and greater commitment uh to technology 

0:55 

what is technology well I have to Define it in the book or rather broadly because not only do I include Machinery like television and uh computers and all that
but also techniques uh I call them invisible Technologies because most people don't
think of them as a a sort of Machinery but things like statistics and polling
and um uh uh bureaucratic forms
any um uh systematic and repeatable
technique that tends to cause people to
uh constrain their thinking about the
world we talked a number of years ago
about
television um what impact is technology

1:50
having on television and what's what's
1:52
the impact on the
1:54
country well one of the reasons Brian
1:57
that I I felt I did this but is that the
2:00
the last time we talked as you suggest
2:04
uh was about a book that was almost
2:06
wholly devoted to television and when I
2:09
started to uh think about that issue I
2:13
realized that you couldn't get a a an
2:16
accurate handle on uh what we Americans
2:20
were all about by focusing on one medium
2:23
that that you had to see television as
2:27
part of a kind of um
2:30
system of techniques and technologies
2:34
that are giving the shape uh to our
2:37
culture for instance um if one wants to
2:40
think about what has happened to public
2:42
life in
2:43
America uh and U one has to think of
2:47
course first about television but also
2:50
about CDs and also about um
2:55
uh all sorts of faxes and telephones and
3:01
all of the Machinery that that takes
3:03
people out of public
3:06
Arenas and keeps them fixed in their
3:09
homes so that we have a kind of
3:12
privatization of American life and one
3:15
here is people say with some
3:18
considerable enthusiasm that in the
3:20
future uh putting television computers
3:23
and the telephone together people will
3:26
be able to shop at home vote at home
3:29
home uh do every Express uh political
3:33
preferences in in many ways at home so
3:36
that they never have to go out in the
3:38
street at all and never have to meet their fellow citizens in any context because we'd have this Ensemble of Technologies uh that keep us private away from from citizens in fact I think uh Ry Peru's idea of a town meeting uh is a new kind of definition of town meeting because it doesn't imply co-presence uh of people he wants to do it via Electronic media so that uh television and as well as other

4:17

Technologies redefine all sorts of things I mean television uh has redefined uh as I think we talked about last time what we mean by a public debate that uh we used to use uh the Lincoln Douglas debates as an example as kind of model or metaphor of what we mean by uh political debate uh these debates would go on for hours television has redefined it so now the two or possibly three candidates stand in front of the television camera and each one is given two minutes to respond to a very difficult question and uh the opponent is given 60 seconds

5:03

to reply now we still call this a debate uh but it's a redefinition of of that term and uh uh Rose perau suggestion that we use television as a form of uh a town meeting is another redefinition of what we once met by town meeting so that the one of the most interesting things about technology is that it redefines our language it it gives us different meanings uh of older words and very often we're not quite uh as aware as we should be of how that process is working good or bad well in this book I mostly emphasize

5:53

the bad part uh I've done that in most of my books but I owe I I admit and uh happily at the beginning of the book that anyone who um uh looks at technology as an either or development

### Nicholas Carr book on concentration

"Nicholas Carr: The Shallows - What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains"   
"Technology commentator Nicholas Carr discusses his book, "The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains," presented by Harvard Book Store. Is use of the Internet causing us to lose the ability to concentrate and think deeply? Drawing from philosophy, neuroscience, and history, "The Shallows" explores how the Internet may be rerouting neural pathways."
