### Year 2013 capability of audio engineering

### Politics is fiction games 

Fiction outsells nonfiction. By adding more fiction to government, more adventure and "choose your own reality", popularity increases. Popularity yields more name recognition and voting and power, both soft power (celebrity fame) and hard power. [Everything is media ecology](Everything_is_ME.md).

ToDo: Look for postings in other subreddits that might get more engagement.

&nbsp;

### The comedy venue

The late-night after-hours forbidden anti-Church.   
Well, the Church speaks of Hell and sin, which is dark, and Church promotes that Heaven and Eden are good and Earth is bad (media ecology of planets, outer space).  
Truth to power. Avoidance of truth. Egoism. 
Getting fired for criticizing those in power, getting paid and popularity for criticizing (the comedian).

August 2, 2025 front page of Reddit social media    
Title: "Bill Burr goes after Billionaires, ‘Horrible racist‘ Conservatives, ‘Treasonous idiot‘ Ben Shapiro, and ‘Disease‘ Fox News"     
https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1mfe87g/bill_burr_goes_after_billionaires_horrible_racist/

Does this create a simulacra of resistance?   
Proxy of saying what people will not stand up in democracy (population, We The People) and say?   
Is he CALLING on the audience to have bravery and courage to repeat what is being said, or just satiating the inner desire and creating spectators / passive office (See Rick Roderick "Self Under Siege" lectures which touches on this media ecology topics of spectacle media consumers)

&nbsp;

### Pleasing to audience, animals 

Animal content is huge in modern audiences. Kitten and puppy photos. In the 1970's posting wtih an automobile was hot, but now it is posing in a photograph with an animal.

### Sports Mentality

Reddit posting front page top: Michelle Obama cooks ESPN: "If I watch ESPN for an hour it's like watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It's the same drama, they're yelling at each other, they don't get along. Stephen A. Smith would be a great Real Housewife. What's the difference? It's just drama."

Media ecology discussion assignment: Rectangle simulacra, armies of medical doctors servicing the ultra rich for entertainment. They could be traveling the world building hospitals, these athletic supermen, but people want fiction framed rectangle screens and rectangle FIFA / NBA / NFL. Why not watch children play in the neighborhood and have exercise and make real world friendship, why are people only interested in rich people's lives? Mythological gods?

&nbsp;

### Faulty Notification Technology?

https://old.reddit.com/r/Wellthatsucks/comments/1mftfz5/terrible_notification_to_get_on_take_off/

Media ecology discussion topic: Study the comments here about experiences getting faulty notifications.  Deeper... did the person spreading this on Reddit just want a discussion, have flight anxiety or lost bag anxiety, and wanted to share... did they likely know that the indicator may be faulty? Is it like car drivers complaining about weather or traffic, despite being a routine topic, just as conversation starters?

&nbsp;

### Ban / Block

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mfwflr/trumps_media_takeover_isnt_about_bias_its_about/

**"Trump's Media Takeover Isn't About Bias, It's About Silencing Dissent"**

Social media has given every person a taste of leveraged machine power: banning people, blocking people. No need to burn physical books on paper like 1930's Nazi Germany... the block button doesn't require flame and paper. Egoism / egomania / echo chambers / [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble). Silencing and grey-rocking those who dissent.  Since October 8, 2013 - Malala has been routinely grey-rocked by social media users - she provides non-fiction content of progressive reformation. Malala's sincere non-fiction is popular in the rise of Donald Trump / MAGA / Putin invasion of Ukraine (February 2014 onward). What's wrong with what Malala Yousafzai has to say? It doesn't go with the flow of using powerful machines to dehumanize and block and silence those in "the others" groups. Donald Trump and [Radio Mullah media behavior](https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/Malala%2038-65.pdf) follow the same year 2012 onward trajectory. People are not willing to face up that what Donald Trump is doing, blocking and silencing people he disagrees with, is commonplace in Bluesky social media year 2024, Reddit social media, etc. Marshall McLuhan educated society about this, such as [this 1977 interview on television: "all forms of violence are a quest for (Text sourced from https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus) identity. When you live out on the frontier, you have no identity. You’re a nobody. Therefore, you get very tough. You have to prove that you are somebody. And so you become very violent. And so identity is always accompanied by violence. This seems paradoxical to you? That ordinary, ordinary people find the need for violence as they lose their identities. So it’s only the threat to people’s identity that makes them — terrorists, hijackers: these are people minus identity. They are determined to make it somehow, to get coverage, to get noticed."](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus)

If people can not even share Unicode messages on computer without burning books / blocking each other, what hope does humanity have for traveling in the same airports together, sharing a cinema together, sharing a sports stadium, sharing a city, eating next to each other ([breaking bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_us_break_bread_together) together). People praise the block button (book burning, silencing of what they disagree with in modern digital forms) as "fixing" the egomania and aggression issues. Machines are not fixing the human problems, people are blocking it out, a form of psychological denial that world peace is not *optional*.

* "The wise saying, "The pen is mightier than sword” was true. **The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them**." - July 12, 2013. Malala Yousafzai: 16th birthday speech.

Highlight 1: the experience of waiting two full months to get corrections to a mistake in the printing / instructions... and having to pay money for the magazine issue with corrections.  

Highlight 2: YouTube community comments such as "Typing in programs like this is why I can type so fast and accurately today. It was the BEST typing tutor! :)" are worth a glance.

Is he (Charles Cornell) [gullible how much](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/19/musk-ackman-election-misinformation) wealth goes into Superbowl media advertising? Is this how earworms are implanted, older target demographic with wealth who knows the song would have it lodged in their mind. That's the themes of Media Ecology of Finnegans Wake, ("Earwicker" is the name of the character, "Earworm" meme themes, Bible verse John 1:1 earworms).

Is this a form of mental exploit. to subconsciously lodge it into the minds? Isn't that the very foundation of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake story... *Wake Up, Woke, Woke to media ecology*? "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

### Neil Postman on technology

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbAPtGYiRvg

0:12

um the tendency in uh American culture to turn over to technology sovereignty command control uh over all of our social institutions in other words the book is about how um America has uh developed a new religion as it were uh and the religion is its faith in U that uh human progress and technological innovation are the same thing and that paradise can be achieved through greater and greater commitment uh to technology 

0:55 

what is technology well I have to Define it in the book or rather broadly because not only do I include Machinery like television and uh computers and all that
but also techniques uh I call them invisible Technologies because most people don't
think of them as a a sort of Machinery but things like statistics and polling
and um uh uh bureaucratic forms
any um uh systematic and repeatable
technique that tends to cause people to
uh constrain their thinking about the
world we talked a number of years ago
about
television um what impact is technology

1:50
having on television and what's what's
1:52
the impact on the
1:54
country well one of the reasons Brian
1:57
that I I felt I did this but is that the
2:00
the last time we talked as you suggest
2:04
uh was about a book that was almost
2:06
wholly devoted to television and when I
2:09
started to uh think about that issue I
2:13
realized that you couldn't get a a an
2:16
accurate handle on uh what we Americans
2:20
were all about by focusing on one medium
2:23
that that you had to see television as
2:27
part of a kind of um
2:30
system of techniques and technologies
2:34
that are giving the shape uh to our
2:37
culture for instance um if one wants to
2:40
think about what has happened to public
2:42
life in
2:43
America uh and U one has to think of
2:47
course first about television but also
2:50
about CDs and also about um
2:55
uh all sorts of faxes and telephones and
3:01
all of the Machinery that that takes
3:03
people out of public
3:06
Arenas and keeps them fixed in their
3:09
homes so that we have a kind of
3:12
privatization of American life and one
3:15
here is people say with some
3:18
considerable enthusiasm that in the
3:20
future uh putting television computers
3:23
and the telephone together people will
3:26
be able to shop at home vote at home
3:29
home uh do every Express uh political
3:33
preferences in in many ways at home so
3:36
that they never have to go out in the
3:38
street at all and never have to meet their fellow citizens in any context because we'd have this Ensemble of Technologies uh that keep us private away from from citizens in fact I think uh Ry Peru's idea of a town meeting uh is a new kind of definition of town meeting because it doesn't imply co-presence uh of people he wants to do it via Electronic media so that uh television and as well as other

4:17

Technologies redefine all sorts of things I mean television uh has redefined uh as I think we talked about last time what we mean by a public debate that uh we used to use uh the Lincoln Douglas debates as an example as kind of model or metaphor of what we mean by uh political debate uh these debates would go on for hours television has redefined it so now the two or possibly three candidates stand in front of the television camera and each one is given two minutes to respond to a very difficult question and uh the opponent is given 60 seconds

5:03

to reply now we still call this a debate uh but it's a redefinition of of that term and uh uh Rose perau suggestion that we use television as a form of uh a town meeting is another redefinition of what we once met by town meeting so that the one of the most interesting things about technology is that it redefines our language it it gives us different meanings uh of older words and very often we're not quite uh as aware as we should be of how that process is working good or bad well in this book I mostly emphasize

5:53

the bad part uh I've done that in most of my books but I owe I I admit and uh happily at the beginning of the book that anyone who um uh looks at technology as an either or development

Is use of the Internet causing us to lose the ability to concentrate and think deeply? Drawing from philosophy, neuroscience, and history, "The Shallows" explores how the Internet may be rerouting neural pathways."

### Work Media Ecology of Information Age

I personally have worked from home since August 1999. Home has included home office in South America, Africa, Middle East, Malaysia, Indonesia and RV all over the USA (8 different RV sizes and shapes). With my wife and solo after divorce.    
Lesson focus:   
1. Is work office culture the same in 1975 vs. 1995 vs 2025?
2. pandemic COVID-19 changes
3. Is work office same in different nations, rural vs. city, other geographic differences.
4. Work hours culture, work days culture. Muslims have their Friday night on Thursday night and do not work on Friday and start week on Sunday in several nations I have lived in.  In Chile in South America, people were used to long work hours and staying up late was more routine.  Japan is famous for after-work obligations for salarymen.
5. Contractors vs. employees and expectations.
6. Jobs that can't possibly be work from home: delivery person, repair person, installation, construction, waiters, drivers, pilots, cleaners, physical labor in factory, fresh food preparations, etc, etc.
7. Working with your spouse and children around during summer school breaks.
8. Vacations and working 'on call' even when on paid holiday.

### Propietary Hardware

The Steam Deck isn't open hardware (confirm that claim?).

Android vs. Apple devices. Apple own't allow Apple operating system to run on non-apple software in almost all cases and has found huge success in selling hardware and software married into a single package. Consumers often try to think of content/software as "free" and selling it inside a "gadget" with specific buttons tends to make more sales / profit. Long history of this in the elctronics industry from the very start. General purpose tools confuse people.

Hardware DRM / anti-piracy / unique hardware such as Nintendo 64 console cartridges that were not compatible with any of existing system.

Microsoft had plenty of anti-compettive issues in the software, the argument can be made that they sabotaged their parterm IBM with OS/2 while developing Windows NT (IBM PC-DOS, Microsot MS-DOS had two companies with source code rihts. IBM OS/2 and Microsoft OS/2 would have been two companies with source code more like how hardware chips are often fabricated by competing companeis to have second-source).... starting sentence over. The one thing Microsoft DID give us compared to Apple - was a far more open chocie of personal computer hardware. Things like supporter printers, supported optical drives, support WiFi hardware, Ethernet network adapters, graphics ccards (GPU chips), etc that Apple's more closed sysem didn't encourage. You can get Windows laptops with every size screen and keyboard imaginable, where with Apple that choice is much more limited. nd you can't run Apple apps on a Windows system easily (or run into legal restrictions / licensing restrictions with the app store). NEEDS EDITING. As does everything. 

Nintendo is really bit on propritary hardware married to their game software. Also on their use game ROM on software emulators. Although there are somteimes open standards used, such as the Nintendo Wii remotes working with Linux Bluetooth conventions.

"But some people did not love Elvis — older people who did not appreciate his hip-swigging new music. Parker began to sell “I Hate Elvis” buttons so he could make money either way. The only button he didn’t sell was something saying, “I feel ambivalent about Elvis.” In a book titled ‘Colonel (The True Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley),’ author Alanna Nash mentions the badges."

### The Message Crashes Your Brain

Being able to fake voice calls and text messages to loved ones to declare someone was killed. Especially if some labor goes into matching it up to a airport trip or train trip or ocean crossing where a lot of conditoined society anxiety media exists.

Being able to fake evidence of an affair / cheating at a job or in a intimate relationshp.

A music video going vial from South Korea, which was not known for world music industry like "The Brish Invasion" of The Beatles world wide or Michael Jackson USA world wide, etc.

Content that alters states of mind.

Marshall McLuhan saying LSD drug users at his unversity said Finnegans Wake poetry, oral reading of The Wake...

Animation triggering known defects in the mind. Is a specific genetic disorder identified on this now?

Questions for media ecology students to ponder:

1. What year was the song published?
2. What year was the video recorded?
3. What year was the upload to YouTube video platform?
4. What year was YouTube well known and recognized by media experts in music publishing?
5. How many backup copies of the recording of the video did they keep?

Ponder: How much money the music publisher makes vs. artist... and they let the copies corrupt and nobody had a backup copy?

Pay attention to the YouTube upload dates of famous acts. Songs not published for years and years after YouTube was famous. It cost next to nothing to upload the song to YouTube, a couple hours of labor. Why not until December 4, 2018? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnEBSY3leQQ "℗ 1978 Geffen Records.

### Internet Origins

Study the comments of this video on Reddit about people who created the Internet. Are they household names? Everywhere in the world? 

Is this video a repost, did the person on Reddit record the video or is it a repost? Can you locate on the World Wid Web any other previous postings or the name and date of when it was recorded? The location of this room, geography?

### Parents feed handed down

Your parents choose your housing location, your school feed, your Mosque or Church feed. The collected assembly of stories known as the Torah / Quran / Bible / Upanishads / etc. People favor fiction poetry passed down from elders / grandparents / parents to child.

“Joyce is, in the Wake, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its **basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology**. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of tribal institutions can return in the electric age, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.”
— Marshall McLuhan, see also “Address at Vision 65” , p. 7

### Media ecology of recorded images

Humanity did not have recorded images. Look at how people behave toward children and young people, the shock and turning away from people outside their current comfort zone.

ToDo: find less spammy site with that list?

Are there books named after Duey decimal system or other public library category systems? ISBN?

YouTube songs named after their YouTube song ID? "The 11-character alphanumeric YouTube video ID system (e.g., dQw4w9WgXcQ) allows for approximately 73 quintillion unique combinations."

### Alternate Reality Games

When fiction media reaches out beyond the cinema screen, television screen, video screen games.

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_telephone_number
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_(telephone_number)
3. Year Zero (2007): This ARG was a marketing campaign for the Nine Inch Nails album of the same name. Players discovered phone numbers hidden in the spectrograms of songs, which led to recordings, websites, and other clues that fleshed out the dystopian plot.

### Information scams

Telephone and text message scams. The phone networks are regulated by the government for a hundred years, but predatory businesses and money making scemes can't be stopped. There are not that many telecom companies at the back-end (many branding front-ends for marketing and pricing) - this is not impossible to regulate. Yet it goes on for decade after decade. Creating a peer to peer hostility in society. Absuve information system usage. People who tolerate abusive relationships, predators, manipulators, "settle for", who would criticize in a personal romance relationship at family / friends level - entirely allow it at the soiety-wide national level.

### Languages of numbers

Measuring and numbers.  Tower of Babel tower climbing conflict experiences.

Language of time is 60 minutes is a full hour. Language of USA currency is that 25 cents is one quarter, one of four, to 100 cents, one full dollar. So mixing one quarter of an hour with one quater of a dollar exposes a mental junction of thnking. The measurement of time units vs. measurement of money.

### How many years to get on YouTube?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HEjeMBNcm8

A business, The Eagles bussinessmen, that has a reputaiton for copyright abuse and in-fighting over wealth and royalty and credits and greed over publication. Which is the very topic of the song itself, "water into wine", no - turning songs into cash and keeping it off youtube for HOW MANY YEARS? Since year 1974, it took until year 2025 LATE, LATE YEAR 2025, to offically upload to YouTube?

"39,130 views  August 29, 2025    
Official Audio for "On the Border" performed by the Eagles. Original song from 'On the Border' (1974)."
