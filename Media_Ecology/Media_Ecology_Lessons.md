### Politics is fiction games 

Fiction outsells nonfiction. By adding more fiction to government, more adventure and "choose your own reality", popularity increases. Popularity yields more name recognition and voting and power, both soft power (celebrity fame) and hard power. [Everything is media ecology](Everything_is_ME.md).

### The comedy venue

Getting fired for criticizing those in power, getting paid and popularity for criticizing (the comedian).

Proxy of saying what people will not stand up in democracy (population, We The People) and say?   
Is he CALLING on the audience to have bravery and courage to repeat what is beinng said, or just satiating the inner desire and creating spectators / passive office (See Rick Roderick "Self Under Siege" lectures which touches on this media ecology topicc of spectacle media consumers)

# Pleasing to audience, animals 

Animal content is huge in modern audiences. Kitten and puppy photos. In the 1970's posting wtih an automobile was hot, but now it is posing in a photograph with an animal.
