# Everything Is ME (Media Ecology)

Everything is Media Ecology...

* The field of media ecology was formally created in 1968 by Neil Postman. Postman coined the term to describe how communication technologies shape human environments and influence how people think, act, and live. While Marshall McLuhan had explored related concepts earlier, Postman is credited with establishing media ecology as a distinct field of study.

* The term "public relations" first appeared in the 1897 Year Book of Railway Literature. However, the practice of public relations, even if not explicitly termed as such, has roots much further back, with examples found in ancient civilizations and throughout history. The formalization of public relations as a profession is generally traced to the early 20th century, particularly with the work of individuals like Ivy Lee and Edward Bernays.

## Everything is PR

“I encounter forms of this attitude every day. The producers who work at the Ostankino channels might all be liberals in their private lives, holiday in Tuscany, and be completely European in their tastes. When I ask how they marry their professional and personal lives, they look at me as if I were a fool and answer: “Over the last twenty years we’ve lived through a communism we never believed in, democracy and defaults and mafia state and oligarchy, and we’ve realized they are illusions, that everything is PR.” **“Everything is PR”** has become the favorite phrase of the new Russia; my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act.
Surkov himself is the ultimate expression of this psychology. As I watch him give his speech to the students and journalists, he seems to change and transform like mercury, from cherubic smile to demonic stare, from a woolly liberal preaching “modernization” to a finger-wagging nationalist, spitting out willfully contradictory ideas: “managed democracy,” “conservative modernization.” Then he steps back, smiling, and says: “We need a new political party, and we should help it happen, no need to wait and make it form by itself.” And when you look closely at the party men in the political reality show Surkov directs, the spitting nationalists and beetroot-faced communists, you notice how they all seem to perform their roles with a little ironic twinkle.”

## Democracy is Media Ecology

Public Relations is top-down, the content creator trickles down to the consumer of content.

Media Ecology is all-inclusive. Where do the content creators *get their ideas*, what is the food chain of media? We The People all inclusive democracy study.
