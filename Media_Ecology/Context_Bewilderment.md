response:

"Woodstock, Georgia is not generally considered a historically Muslim area in the same way some cities in countries like the United Arab Emirates might be labeled.

However, Islam has had a presence in Georgia for a long time, dating back to the 7th century, with Tbilisi even serving as the capital of an Islamic emirate for a time."
