Dear people:

Trump vanity is a bonfire to the nation via super-fast content delivery. Trump’s entrance to social media devastates minds. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j13oJajXx0M

The Reddit Hive Mind / mindsets of hard dehumanizing hate over pronoun usage, gender pronouns, word choice, grammar, sentence structure, and syntax differences of English. Having the Tower of Babel ego irritated by Trumpism / Trump-speak / MAGA-speak / Fox News Tweet / Writing / speaking for over 10 years and 5 months… 3,833 days of constant siege of language by people’s attraction to Trump’s distinctive unique super-star style and fashion of communications. The outstanding Trump dialog / body language / gestures / facial expressions / writing / orating / organizing presentations is irresistible to the USA population. We The People of the USA can not get enough of the unique style and fashion of Trump’s expressions.

People so entertained by Trump’s dialog and presentations start dehumanizing and hating harder and harder when they encounter some unimportant person without power using English in an annoying and different way than their Reddit Hive Mind conditioned MAGA Trump content. That someone has spent decades AVOIDING the paths to MAGA and Trump thinking induced by Fox News language fascination and attraction triggers people into anti-goodness street attacks. **“Do You Speak Fox?” By Megan Garber** September 2020 https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/ - so many consume and are deeply attracted to Reddit for the 3,833 days of stimulation from Donald J. Trump’s media presence / memes and Trump content. Trump is the Pied Piper of meme mills and social messaging systems. Any time day or night, We The People of the USA are stimulated with vibrations and touch with Trump’s moves and shakes; Trump’s bulletins and declarations!  No sports star or religion leader or politician or actor or entertainer of any kind has ever been such a magnet for media consumers.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDgUoAQC8Y

Free thinkers outside the attraction and seeking of Trump on Reddit try to speak between lines of Trump oration… https://youtu.be/I0fGxujeJbY?t=105 - Reddit only sees what MAGA shows it. Reddit is the slaves of the phony leaders, Murdoch / Musk / Trump. Media audience fandom of Trump distortion, noise and artifacts... people who can’t even grasp concepts like this October 26, 1973 opera. … … … “Pete Townshend's Quadrophenia uses "schizophrenia" as a metaphor for its protagonist, Jimmy, having four distinct personalities (representing the four Who members: tough Roger, romantic John, lunatic Keith, hypocritical Pete) struggling for control, linked to a quest for identity within the Mod subculture, and also referencing the new quadrophonic sound technology. It's a metaphor for internal conflict and adolescent identity crisis, a "bleeding quadrophenic" state.” – Google Search summary 2025-12-13 https://youtu.be/I0fGxujeJbY?t=260

Donald Trump has made the population sick and crazy with his style, fashion, and timing of communications. It is a mass orgy of chaos and nonsense messaging and attraction to a bewildering soup of incoherence. So many people are seeking Trump’s content. Biggest influencer in world history.

It is beyond words, speechless, to describe how long this shitshow of Trump attraction has been going on. My God, the USA is wrecked by this incredibly bad fascination, boundless Trump seeking. **Who the fuck wants to be popular and fit in with a nation driven to this man’s content. Endless Trump!**
