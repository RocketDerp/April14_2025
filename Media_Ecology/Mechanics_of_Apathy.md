# Mechanics of Apathy

2025 has been the worst year of my entire life.

I can not go with the flow of Putin leadership medhos and techniques in USA year 2025.

Pluribus TV series the last two months of the year have made me realize the grim "We the People" participaiton in itall.

People are more motivated by the sports-game and Apple TV+ show content than non-fiction 

The agression, the motivation people have to declare something is simple, dumb, easy, trivial is overpowering of all goodness.

It's the attiude I expeirenced living inthe Middle East towards non-believers. Not like Malala and MLK Jr: who view people as poorly educated or prizing misunerstandings. But an agressive insulting and mocking of the others.
