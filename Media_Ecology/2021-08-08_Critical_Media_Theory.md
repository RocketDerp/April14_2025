Critical Media Theory    

Starting with 4 teachers/professors: Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Rick Roderick. This is not a subreddit for commenting rapidly on new post with low-effort one liners and latest meme talking points.

NOTE: It's easy for people in 2022 to confuse the word "media" to an abbreviation of "news/journalism media". No, we are not talking about "news media" only here. All media, "music media", "social media", "mass media", ***MultiMedia***, etc. When people use the word "mainstream media" in 2022, they are abbreviating "breaking news media".
