Critical Media Theory    

Starting with 4 teachers/professors: Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Rick Roderick. This is not a subreddit for commenting rapidly on new post with low-effort one liners and latest meme talking points.

NOTE: It's easy for people in 2022 to confuse the word "media" to an abbreviation of "news/journalism media". No, we are not talking about "news media" only here. All media, "music media", "social media", "mass media", ***MultiMedia***, etc. When people use the word "mainstream media" in 2022, they are abbreviating "breaking news media".

# Amusement Commenting Above All Else

* “Most of our daily news is inert, consisting of information that gives us something to talk about but cannot lead to any meaningful action. This fact is the principal legacy of the telegraph: By generating an abundance of irrelevant information”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

Social media society, Bluesky and Reddit, have been unable to focus on important critical asserts. [Examples of what is important to assert in the face of Russia and MAGA rise since year 2012, "Brainrot Society 47"](/PostMalala/Assert_Malala/Brainrot_Society_47.md)

People become addicted to the rush of high-speed message delivery and crowd emotions. Like a casino environment.

* “The auditory elements of slots are carefully crafted to enhance the overall gaming experience, creating an immersive environment that captivates players,” Bennett observes. “Slot machine sounds are designed to evoke emotions, trigger excitement, and maintain player engagement throughout the gaming session.” -https://cdcGaming.com/commentary/frank-floor-talk-the-siren-calls-of-the-casino-floor/

* [Cambridge Analytica topic book in year 2019 described this very concern](/Quotes_Pile/Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md) about social media and society at large.

There has been no rise of a "top concerns list" in the face of IRA, MAGA, and Fox News HDTV takeover of minds since year 2012. The loudest persistent assertion in year 2025 was for a list, information list, for Epstein. Not for justice, not for girls to be protected, literally just pursuit of information list. yes, the list may be a step towards justice, but that's now how people are behaving. Removing those loyal to Putin's self-harm programming and anti-NATO mindsets (self-harm USA mindsets to be even more blunt) should be the priority.

Without a list of important topics, it has almost all been driven by the billionaires top-down. Audiences on social media *react*, are **reactionary** to the billionaires. 

* Absence of Dr. Bandy X Lee being asserted with repeating and *this is important* emphasis since October 3, 2017 by everyday citizens on social systems. [For Example](/Quotes_Pile/Bandy_X_Lee)
