# PTSD / CPTSD from Donald Trump Experience

First off, you have to put aside an ideas you have that people understand they are in a media cult when inside a media cult. This has never been true of monomyth religion cults of media story Torah science fiction, media venue Church of science fiction, Quran and Mecca science fiction cults, etc. We have known for thousands of years that people indoctrinated into a media cult (Fox News, etc) are not self-aware of cults.

This was articulated directly after World War Two:

“The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.”

Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945
