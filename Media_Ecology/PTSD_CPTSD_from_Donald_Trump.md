# PTSD / CPTSD from Donald Trump Experience

First off, you have to put aside an ideas you have that people understand they are in a media cult when inside a media cult. This has never been true of monomyth religion cults of media story Torah science fiction, media venue Church of science fiction, Quran and Mecca science fiction cults, etc. We have known for thousands of years that people indoctrinated into a media cult (Fox News, etc) are not self-aware of cults.

This was articulated directly after World War Two:

“The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.”

Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945

# The Inner Pain and Anguish

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s **simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken**. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. Published in 1995, [shortly before his death from cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJs5oTN60iw). He knew about pain.

## Flag image trauma 

Trump supporters really waved a lot of flags in faces since 2015 for what in reality (beyond the Kremlin war against reality) was Putin values, Russia systems. A false flag symbolism in the brain attack of information warfare... where the meaning is [corrupted or outright inverted](https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/).

## Red Hat trauma

Seeing a red hat, regardless of what it says or images on it.

## Hearing or reading names

"Donald Trump".

## Encountering Fox News

flipping channels, friend's house has it on TV, at a business encounter. Newsmax, etc.

### Broken holidays, broken families, broken homes

Grief for the loss of opportunity and goodness itself being trashed.

### Hate of the other genders, sex hate

# Tools for Media Cults 

James Joyce, Irish writer, was trying to cult deprogram an entire nation - Ireland, from Bible-induced (science fiction storytelling) cults.

Joseph Campbell at age 83, Skywalker Ranch California interviews: "The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion (**MAGA passion**) into compassion. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is **the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses** — the awakening of his hero, Stephen Dedalus, to manhood through a **shared compassion** with Leopold Bloom. That was the awakening of his heart to love and the opening of the way."
