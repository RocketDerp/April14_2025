# PTSD / CPTSD from Donald Trump Experience

First off, you have to put aside an ideas you have that people understand they are in a media cult when inside a media cult. This has never been true of monomyth religion cults of media story Torah science fiction, media venue Church of science fiction, Quran and Mecca science fiction cults, etc. We have known for thousands of years that people indoctrinated into a media cult (Fox News, etc) are not self-aware of cults.

This was articulated directly after World War Two:

“The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.”

Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945

# The Inner Pain and Anguish

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s **simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken**. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. Published in 1995, [shortly before his death from cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJs5oTN60iw). He knew about pain.

## Flag image trauma 

Trump supporters really waved a lot of flags in faces since 2015 for what in reality (beyond the Kremlin war against reality) was Putin values, Russia systems. A false flag symbolism in the brain attack of information warfare... where the meaning is [corrupted or outright inverted](https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/).

## Red Hat trauma

Seeing a red hat, regardless of what it says or images on it.

## Hearing or reading names

"Donald Trump". OPERA_A Katy Lied lyrics from a NYC band / Trump home town: "Five **names that I can hardly stand to hear**... Including yours and mine and one more chimp who isn't here. I can see the ladies talking how the **times are getting hard**" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiBfhFvJdvc

## Encountering Fox News

flipping channels, friend's house has it on TV, at a business encounter. Newsmax, etc.

### Broken holidays, broken families, broken homes

Grief for the loss of opportunity and goodness itself being trashed.

### Hate of the other genders, sex hate

&nbsp;

## I told you, warned you experience

The extreme frustration that other people tusted Fox News television and not you. The power of media systems to overpower *the little guy* with the billioniare *big guy* commercial art. See: Jen Senko's film and book,a baby boomer who stood up to Fox News and other media.

## Trusting People who Trust Trump

Dealing with all the anxiety of having to trust people who obiviously trust Fox News at face value and trust that Donald Trump was good for the future of the USA. The generalized society-wide anxiety of sitting on a time-bomb of trusting a man who trusts Putin.

## Competition, "winner takes all"

The never-ending competition, even when competition ended, it goes on.

There shouldn't be a competition between no health care and health care. Between homeless and having a home. Dog eat dog attraction to dog fighting violence. Attraction to domination and cruelty. Seeing mob mentality and runaway sports addiction values applied to society at large, the body politic as a sport of toxic poisoning for attention seeking.

Still having the memories before year 2013, even seeing a film before year 2013, that depicts a reality of real life that wasn't constant self-harm and pranks against goodness. The siege against goodness. The enshitification of society / government into antics cruelty competition. 

## having been defeated by Russia and nobody defended

The intellectual artists, the commercial artists, did not defend against Russia in the March 2013 onward meme warfare. Many will feel shame and CPTSD for having lost a mental manipulation war and knowing nobody with the talents and gifts of art really tried to raise awareness of key authors (Peter P) and teachers (Neil Postman) while happily joining in with the mocking and insulting humanism via graphics arts.

Watching your nation fall for Russian mind games of creative fiction media arts:   
https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mfr6vw/magas_new_russiagate_evidence_likely_made_up_by/

How could Americans, of all people, forgotten that Russia was a hostile enemy? The PTSD / CPTSD of such a mental blunder to trust and believe Russia. Putin has been a **dictator** for 25 years, Putin was a KGB officer in Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the last possible source of information you trust is the Kremlin! Red Flags entirely ignored!

# Tools for Media Cults 

James Joyce, Irish writer, was trying to cult deprogram an entire nation - Ireland, from Bible-induced (science fiction storytelling) cults.

* "I confess that I do not see what good it does to fulminate against the English tyranny while the Roman tyranny occupies the palace of the soul." - James Joyce. "Ireland, Island of Saints and Sages," lecture, Università Popolare, Trieste (27 April 1907)

Joseph Campbell at age 83, Skywalker Ranch California interviews: "The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion (**MAGA passion, Fox News passion**) into compassion. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is **the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses** — the awakening of his hero, Stephen Dedalus, to manhood through a **shared compassion** with Leopold Bloom. That was the awakening of his heart to love and the opening of the way."

"I feel like at this point even those of us who have seen more normal presidencies have all been traumatised by this shit for so long that it's caused all of us some kind of mass brain trauma/PTSD/something. It can't be healthy to be exposed to this insanity constantly, and it didn't just start with Trump either."

### Thursday December 11, 2025 (Quote about Russia Hybrid warfare day)    

Media Ecology is this page organization on GitHub. And you see social media "The Media" ecology of flippant mockery and dismissal of Deceleration of Independence meaning of "self-evident" 1776 year.

CPTSD / PTSD of Trumpism / Fox News nation / Putin hybrid warfare and Putin since year 1999 enduring techniques. Putinism WORKS, PROVEN SYSTEM! And terrorizing stress-lording / PTSD. Ukraine war since February 2014 - STILL ONGOING into year 2026. IT WORKS. Surkovian methods WORK in wrecking goodness, CPTSD. How many families and marriages broken by Fox News HDTV anti-reality / Kremlin War Against Reality since March 2013?
