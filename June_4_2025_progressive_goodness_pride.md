USA progressive goodness pride

Mocking DOGE since November 2024 has not been goodness. It's just been mocking and insulting and badness. 

People seem to have some good out of Ukraine scoring the Russian airplane destructions. But that's still rooted in badness of Russia not realizing the war itself is bad.

A new Nintendo Switch console among the tech social media consumers... really isn't the kind of goodness we need.

Elon Musk failing with Tesla isn't goodness.

Sports, video games, entertainment (Star Wars Andor TV series) isn't the kind of goodness I'm seeing as absent.

USA long-term relationship damage on the world stage.

The World is going to be very sick of this White House, regardless if JD Vance or whoever takes over. The long-term damage cheering is going to take place from the rest of the world when bad news comes out of USA.

I don't think people are facing up to just how anti-goodness anti-compassion anti-love anti-understanding now the USA is going to be recognized.
