USA progressive goodness pride

Mocking DOGE since November 2024 has not been goodness. It's just been mocking and insulting and badness. 

People seem to have some good out of Ukraine scoring the Russian airplane destructions. But that's still rooted in badness of Russia not realizing the war itself is bad.

A new Nintendo Switch console among the tech social media consumers... really isn't the kind of goodness we need.

Elon Musk failing with Tesla isn't goodness.

Sports, video games, entertainment (Star Wars Andor TV series) isn't the kind of goodness I'm seeing as absent.

USA long-term relationship damage on the world stage.

The World is going to be very sick of this White House, regardless if JD Vance or whoever takes over. The long-term damage cheering is going to take place from the rest of the world when bad news comes out of USA.

I don't think people are facing up to just how anti-goodness anti-compassion anti-love anti-understanding now the USA is going to be recognized. 

Bluesky has not been the reform of social media, it's been anti-Musk and not pro-goodness. People are still not facing up to the reactionary recency bias problems of constantly tossing out yesterday's news in favor of new notifications.

Progressive goodness and facing the self-harm aftermath of USA being so attracted to hate and anti-goodness anti-compassion.

The we hate each other bender.   
The we hate humanism drunken bender.   
Drunk on memes and insult and hate messaging bender.  

We "Ate the Surkov Onion" for so long.   
The window of blaming Russia and Cambridge Analytica is probably closed. We had an opportunity to highlight this with the invade Greenland (EU), invade Canada, stop supporting Ukraine - but that window of time is probably closed now in June 2025...

It is important people understand the depth of the problem and address attraction to hate, attraction to badness, attraction to total mockery Surkov / Surkovian patterns. But the window of being able to blame Russia has likely passed and now the rest of the world is likely unwilling to rescue the hearts and minds of USA online. People are sick of the USA brand and symbols and what they now represent has sunk in, the rebranding is complete, badness is expected and a few good things are not gong to turn the expectation around.

Humility and focus

Admit we did not rescue MAGA. Rural people were the least-educated in New York / Manhattan University Neil Postman 1985 teachings. The social media industry did not educate end-users on Neil Postman's social theories of what electric media would do to society, what meme entertainment framing would do. Blaming this as a humility focus would be good learning from mistakes. 

USA gorged on meme messages. All news was entertainment.  
USA gorged on hate MAGA, hate others. Hate for hate.   
USA gorged on anti-liberal without even understanding why. MAGA was a bad movement, and addressing that should set a global example of why Taliban values are bad.
