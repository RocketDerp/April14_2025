# Handed Down Hate

In USA, it is becoming increasily clear

Israel vs. Palestine? same situation?

Hate as faith handed down.

That many parents after World War Two with Japan and Germany from USA - were partend to believe that kindness and goodness are bad. Children raised by parents to believe in murder, assasination (Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump assisnations), hate and mocking were essential.

High competitive sports, manipulation, tricky to bansh all goodness, coimpassion, love.

And now since December 2013 when Putin announced the takeove of the entire world values and control https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

And Then the February 2014 invasion / warfare waged https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War

Children programmed by thier parents that once they got the signal like the start of World War Two and World War One, to start promoting killing / murder / hate / dehumanization values.

Like a complete wrong set of answers to war! Fight fire with fire! Fight hate with suepr hate! 

Now I can see why so many parents have horrific abusive divorces and extremely terrible child custody battles as lessons. People who have raised in families that war from Putin to force the whole world under Russian values is the time to shift focus towards cocnentration camps, increasing prisons, gulags, USSR values.

I have seen these behaviors within families my whole life, but I used to think it was . But since December 2013 annoucnement and Februarhy 2014 war from Ukraine, you can see more and more there are people who have embraced Russia and Putin's desires to 

1. Eliminate free speech if it teaches ending wars

2. Attack fee speech if it promotes goodness and ending hate

3. Attack and imprison people who promote kidness and understanding through education

4. Attack and imprioson people who promote education and learning for all people and not to have a system of high educated peopel ruling and lording over uneducated people

5. You see this values in Swat Valley, Pakstin ignored since year 2013, despite the coverage in news in USA.

6. And you see Putin's ideas once they are visible to everyone in February 2014 - adopted by USA people who were paented to prize war / prize hate / prize conquest / prize conflicts to dehumanize educated people.

7. Poi Pot and Cambodia was taught by parents as a role model behavior?

8. The prizing of ignorance / celebrationof igorance prented in the name of sports competittion and domination by parents? What Carl Sagan described in his 1995 book?
