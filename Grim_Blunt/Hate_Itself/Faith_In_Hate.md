# Faith in Hate

Time and time again since the IRA went online / Putin Media Invasion started in year 2013, I've seen increasingly deep fatih in hate. There is no "high road" ( ToDo: link other pages aboug high road criticisms and observations ).

People act like basic civility, basic goodness 

Love thy enemy doesn't mean have sexual intercourse and share a bed with them, there are love outside marriage / parenting. People act like it's someone else's job (magical Jesus to come from outer space) to teach love and not us. If we don't value love and criticizing those who hate, what kind of society do we get... one that embraces Russian Internet Infromation Warfare since year 2013: Hate Americans, Hate nonfiction, Hate Progress.

&Nbsp;

Hate harder messages. Encourage media networks of hate that hate itself is good by hating upon them.
