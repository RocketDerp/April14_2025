8. HERE IS THE PONT of this message, age 32 - hate each other more than any person in the world

**My ex, my ex-spouse, my ex-wife, my ex-husband, I hate them more than any other person in the entire world! More than putin, I hate my ex, more than Hitler, I hate my ex**

I have witnessed this behavior and attitude and prize of hate, the priizng of hate, over and over and over since year 1982. 

The people that they CHOOSE, FREELY CHOSSE, to love - is the person they detest / hate / mock/ insult / despise more than any other human out of 8 billion on Earth.

This is an elephant in the room. I think people don't even know what love and compassion are! But they sure know what hate is.

We know how peopel are masters of hate. Multiple nations in the world have military. Military is organied killing / execution / murder out of anti-love, out of hate. Russia has millions of people who hate Ukraine people since February 2014 and kill them. People need to face up that hate and dehumanization can be witnessed. Killing and murdering people for inciredibly shallow and super shallow reasons. tHere is  no *good reason* for Russians to hate ukrainia people sice February 2014, and people are not facing up to this truth of reality itiself.
Russia has mastered manipulating minds to be anti-reality, detached fromreality, and to follo messages and inforamtion as if they accurately represent reality. this is described September 9, 2014 - after the start of the February 2014 war: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/
