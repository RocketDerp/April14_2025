# Prizing hate Values

1. National divorce, civil war

2. World divorce, war against all other nations

3. Hate itself as religion, hate as faith system, the deepest most prized value is that hate and killing and murder will be the final solution to any challenge.

4. Murder/suicide. Poison the earth with toxic technology and behavior and kill others with you. Islamic terrorists as admired role models.

# Adult Choice Marriage

Circumstances:

1. Free / not enslaved adults. Age 22 and over. Not age 16 "high school romance"
2. Not pregnant. No existing children. No adopted siblings or other such situation. Free of any obligation other than self.
3. Educated. Understand how the economy works, how governments work, how religions work etc. Not bamboozled, tricked by some religion clergy or government tax incentive into a relationship.
4. Independent. Has lived away from parents for years. Maybe at least 100 kilometers away from parents and siblings.

Pattern:

1. Two people in the above circumstances encounter each other
2. Say age 26 to age 28. Both within 2 years of each other at minimum age 26
3. Dating / courtship for 30 days.
4. Fall in love, move in together / cohabit ate. Experience living with each other for 18 months
5. Free adult choice to get engaged to be married for 90 days. A ritual to ensure this lifelong / eternal commitment is being faced with free thinking and mental pondering. 90 day undo period.
6. Age 26 (assuming couple met at age 26). Married / wedding of reasonable expense. $2,000 to $6,000 like a Thanksgiving or Christmas gathering / meal for friends and family.
7. No immediate children. May choose to have children after 18 months married, age 31
8. HERE IS THE POINT of this message, age 33 - hate each other more than any person in the world

**My ex, my ex-spouse, my ex-wife, my ex-husband, I hate them more than any other person in the entire world! More than Putin, I hate my ex, more than Hitler, I hate my ex**

I have witnessed this behavior and attitude and prize of hate, the prizing of hate, over and over and over since year 1982. 

The people that they CHOOSE, FREELY CHOOSE, to love - is the person they detest / hate / mock/ insult / despise more than any other human out of 8 billion on Earth.

This is an elephant in the room. I think people don't even know what love and compassion are! But they sure know what hate is.

When there **are children** in the marriage, say age 36 and the couple has been married now since age 28. Had a child at age 31, had a child at age 33. Now at age 36 the children are 5 years old and 3 years old. And now at age 36 the ex hate, I hate my ex, my ex is the worst human in the entire world, worse than Hitler and Putin combined. That deep deep deep hate.

The child custody battles I have witnessed. Adult divorced people at age 41 who have children now age 10 and age 8. And I have met dozens of them in person in taverns / bars / my travels all over USA in an RV. And the HATE these people have for the person they married, the person they loved the most in the entire world at age 26, now at age 41 they HATE they HATE they HATE and the hate is incredibly toxic. They wreck the children's future in competitive hate with their ex-spouse, ex-wife, ex-husband. They describe it for hours in details and if you meet these people multiple times over months and years it sustains, a constant stage of extreme hate. For the person they loved more than any other in the world. the egomaniac situations I have witnessed. And I have seen it time and time again in multiple geographic conditions. Dozens and dozens of such people since year 1982 when I started truly listening to people's motivations. Hate.

## Forest level of humanity

The big picture, forest for the trees.

### Military training / Catch-22

1. Joseph Heller's 1961 Catch-22
2. Banality of Evil, Hannah Arendt 

We know how people are masters of training hate, teaching hate. Multiple nations in the world have military. Military is organized killing / execution / murder out of anti-love, out of hate. Russia has millions of people who hate Ukraine people since February 2014 and kill them. People need to face up that hate and dehumanization can be witnessed. Killing and murdering people for incredibly shallow and super shallow reasons. Here is  no *good reason* for Russians to hate Ukrainian people since February 2014, and people are not facing up to this truth of reality itself.

Russia has mastered manipulating minds to be anti-reality, detached from reality, and to follow messages and information as if they accurately represent reality. this is described September 9, 2014 - after the start of the February 2014 war: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

### Levant religions

I moved to the Middle East during the Arab Spring to study media ecology and religion vs. religion conflicts.

Oh boy, on my, what a fucking nightmare. People who have never met each other who trust messages and stories from religion clergy who HATE with the deepest faith in HATE, people they have neve met in person.

Plenty to write on this subject.

# Living in hate saturation

Living in Palestine, parenting in Palestine, in year 2024.    
Living in Russia in year 2024.    
Living in United States of America year 2025.   

Are people enjoying hate? Why do they continue hate when living in hate? Why is hate Prized?

I think people don't understand love, do not comprehend compassion, that people have not expereinced or grasped what they have experienced. That's at the heart of this page's intended expansion / further writing.

Why do people prize hate? They don't comprehend love and compassion.   
People die for hate, war is death in service to hate. War killings, war deaths, military killings, military deaths, are surely not in service to compassion and love.   
The wild idea that you love your family by going across the world to kill members of another family you never met. Even airplane pilots dropping bombs on members of families they can't even recognize from high altittue of air flight.... etc, etc, etc.   
Writing this shit is shit itself. But in this is why the uSA worhips and prizes the Hate of Donlad Trump / MAGA / Rupert Murdoch / Putin in year 2025.
