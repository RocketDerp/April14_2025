# Acomplishments of Hate

Defeating others, tricking others, anti-helping others. Being better-off than others.

The competitive mindsets. 

Good ideas are good ideas. We do not have to be the originators to good ideas to appreciate them. In fact, it can be incredily difficult and time-intensive and labor-intensive to understand ideas originate from life on Earth / Cosmos / other people. E=MC2 isn't something we all originate. 

Rick Roderick in 1993 said about when God created everything we could understand appreciation. "Because the little individual actors sink into insignificance compared to the damn spectacle of the thing. The spectacle of it. I mean, when humans were less important than God we could understand because he built everything. When we are less important than a Nintendo we get confused. That’s when we start thinking that we are under siege. It’s when Billy says “Oh yes, you can kill mum and dad but leave the Nintendo”, then we are rightfully upset."

Malala's year 2012 and year 2013 expressions, learning in 2012 what she had said to the public / to the world since January 2009. What we "Settle For" with wars and terrorism. The accomplishments of making life unfun for a little girl. I just don't see the accomplishment in hate that others see. The glory of using guns and weapon systems to lord over other people. I see an abandonment of education and understanding. 

If education and undestanding do not work, it all comes down to a ticking time bomb. Compared to the technology I ahve witnessed since my birth in year 1969... a gun weapon seems to primitive and small. We KNOW of chemical warfare from World War One, we know of nuclear warfare from World War Two. What if we discover some physics like the modern LED that we just didn't grasp. "Electroluminescence from a solid state diode was discovered in 1906 by Henry Joseph Round of Marconi Labs, and was published in February 1907 in Electrical World."

What if we discover something that relatively wasy to produce, inexpensive, that could kill. Something way beyond a gun or bomb as we know them. And can't be detected like a bomb can with chemistry testing / smells and swabs and other chemical detection methods.

We teach people that accidental house fires and building fires are bad and we should work towards education, fire drills, and prevention. We value that airplaine accidents are bad and the effort that goes into prevent accidents. Yet, war and hate we have yet to confront.

February 28, 1954: "The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world." - Martin Luther King Jr.
