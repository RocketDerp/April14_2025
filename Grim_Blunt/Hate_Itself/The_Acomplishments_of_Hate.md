# Acomplishments of Hate

Defeating others, tricking others, anti-helping others. Being better-off than others.

The competitive mindsets. 

Good ideas are good ideas. We do not have to be the originators to good ideas to appreciate them. In fact, it can be incredily difficult and time-intensive and labor-intensive to understand ideas originate from life on Earth / Cosmos / other people. E=MC2 isn't something we all originate. 

Rick Roderick in 1993 said about when God created everything we could understand appreciation. "Because the little individual actors sink into insignificance compared to the damn spectacle of the thing. The spectacle of it. I mean, when humans were less important than God we could understand because he built everything. When we are less important than a Nintendo we get confused. That’s when we start thinking that we are under siege. It’s when Billy says “Oh yes, you can kill mum and dad but leave the Nintendo”, then we are rightfully upset."
