# Real World Peace

Real halting and reversing course as a society or in relationships. And by reversing course, i don't mean ending it, I mean going back to good times and finding new paths. 

## World of bad mood: War Time

A world of Russia December 2013 where plans are given a "go" to wage war on Ukraine.

The Russia of year 2007 isn't the same Russia s year 2015 in bad terrible way.

Same with Malala and Swat Valley change of girls and education. 2007?

A marriage where abusing children, hate, dehumanization is just "a period" to accept tha tis like war and terrorism periods.
