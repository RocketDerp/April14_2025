# Putin Coattails

"To "ride someone's coattails" means to benefit from another person's success or popularity without having achieved it on your own."

It's a phrase I remember from high school... November 6, 1984 time period. Those who jumped on the momentum of Ronald Reagan and rode on his success.

I personally think in a world of 8 billion people with James Joyce defined "History is a Nightmare" (Joseph Campbel's interpretation of Joyce at least, at age 83 in Power of Myth)...

### I detect the egomania at top of the stairs

That we don't need orginality unless it's good. What I have seen in my world travels, as the facts unravel, I foubd this to be true: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8Oq_q7Bnw

We all need to get on The 1954 Equation same page. The comeptition to be "orginal" and better...

Leo Buscaglia year 1982

"I am a survivor of a concentration camp. My eyes saw what no person should witness. Gas chambers built by learned engineers. Children poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human."

You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis. We'll it's not working by osmosis!

- From the chapter "The Art of Being Fully Human" page 127 of "Living, Loving & Learning" by Leo Buscaglia, Ph. D. as he refers to Haim Ginott's book
