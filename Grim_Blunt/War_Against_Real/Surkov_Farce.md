# Surkov Farce

December 31, 2014 BBC Adam Curtis: "A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control."

I think the "War Against Reality" Surkov and Putin launched in year 2013 ran into ChatGPT year 2022. All the monomyth patterns of Surkov students and Cambridge Analytica became training material for large language models. And the Pentagon and Elon Musk (SpaceX Pentagon / SpaceX NASA) jumped on with huge investment. So now the mind-fuck patterns are runaway, the simualcra patterns are in runaway. Whatever control Russia had over influencing the outcomes got blended into all monomyth stories ever authored by humans and printed in the public library... training data for machine intelligence. And now it's a far larger synbolism gumbo pot.
