# Social Media Society Did Not

&nbsp;

People like to say "capitalism caused this", which I'm not disagreeing with. But I think "Late stage capitalism" gets plenty of criticism and coverage.

What does not get much criticized is free time / spare time / what pases for entertainment.   
Not much critial thinking.

Donald Trump is an entertainer. People are motivated to hate, meme, mock Donald Trump. This has been going on for a decade sinceJune 2015.

Nott reacting to breaking news. Why isn't social media society organizing non-reactions?   
I've seen coverage of "No Kings" protest, but not an online protest.
