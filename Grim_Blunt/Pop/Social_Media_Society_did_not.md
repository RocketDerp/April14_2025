# Social Media Society Did Not

&nbsp;

People like to say "capitalism caused this", which I'm not disagreeing with. But I think "Late stage capitalism" gets plenty of criticism and coverage.

What does not get much criticized is free time / spare time / what pases for entertainment.   
Not much critial thinking.

Donald Trump is an entertainer. People are motivated to hate, meme, mock Donald Trump. This has been going on for a decade sinceJune 2015.

Nott reacting to breaking news. Why isn't social media society organizing non-reactions?   
I've seen coverage of "No Kings" protest, but not an online protest.

# So much reaction

Living in USA has been sheer reaction to Donald Trump. I think many have lost sense of life before Donald Trump being the center of attentin. The 4 years of Joe Biden were not an escape from Donald Trump, it did not return to year 2012 

The Red Hat MAGA:   
July 2015    
“He came around the corner and we all went, ‘Oh!,’ CNN’s Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. “I really remember it vividly because it was like, ‘Oh, of course, he’s the master marketer. Why wouldn’t he put it on a hat?’”      
“It’s just a disruptive technology,” Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. “People who weren’t involved in politics, that didn’t have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.”

July 2015 is more than 10 years ago as I create this page in August 2015    
Living in a hate-motivated reactionary society. media machines of every size and shape from the largest cloud computing media clusters to all the smartphones people carry... humming with nonstop Donald Trump coverage and fawning. Those who hate Donald Trump and mock Trump promote the same thing as MAGA: mockery and hate.

It has been an ocean of mockery and hate. Mocking MLK Jr's lessons on hate. "Great again" ahs been a complete abandonment, to before 1954 when MLK Jr said all hate is bad. To the 1930's and 1940's industrail machine rise thinking that lead to Japan having aircraft carriers attacking Pearl Harbor with machines to underwater boats, to rocket machines bombing London.

### Mueller coming  

The Reddit society adopted chanting like MAAGA, such as The Wire TV show fiction phrase taken to "Mueller coming" to give payback on Trump. Reacting to every rumor of Trump impeachment over Russia issues. 

Soccial media did not stand up and shut down entertainment and CALL for. There are people who telephpone politicians, representatives, but not a dispaly that We The People were harmed by Russia and Trumpism and wanted the removal - not on the scale of other social media events like major football games or the release of a major new video game - or outage of a social media platform.

Donald Trumpdraws haters into reaction, exploits hate mindsets. People seem to drain away any idea of bottom-up progress. The society in total realy needs a morality preacher, a MLK Jr. Donald Trump is a force of hate and dehumanization. Worship the rich and wealthy, worship power attraction of Donald Trump. A MLK jr or Malala (Pakistan) force.  Jen Senko March 2016, before November 2016, film was not that rise - and it should have been. Jen Senko, the baby boomer who stood up to Fox News, did not get the attention that the topic needed. Just like social media didn't stand for sustained Entertainment "The Apprentice" crticisim.

1. Carl Sagan on Dumb and Dumber
2. Neil Postman, entertaining ourselves to death politics of Ronald Regan and I vidily remember my high school classs in the 2nd term of Ronald Reagan in 1985. The celebrity charm and worship. Rick Roderick in 1993 saw this with his Duke University students looking back a few short year after... how it was such a Hyper Real social experience.

### Hate Motivated Relationships

Donald Trump has made dehumanization and hate "fun" for Americans on a national scale. Trump brought people together in hate motivations, relationships built upon faith in hate. since June 2015. For 10 years and 2 months, hate worship USA.

### Consuming spare time / free time

Putting in the spare time and free time on social media, commenting millions and millions of low-effort no quotations, no author names, no links, no book titles, all on different pages with disposable lifetime... to avoid nonfiction learning and *getting on the same page* and standing up for important and critical goodness.

Monday November 10, 2025 situation    

I agree, "We The People" have not stood up to Fox News (support Jen Senko), we did not stand up to the media addiction / Rescue MAGA / Russian information war. Putin won. People are entertained by Trump, entertainment wins. "No Kings" expressed emotion but it did not present a plan to take on Surkov information warfare / IRA / Fox News addiction / media ecology crisis. People don't even recognize we are in Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourself To Death" situation around a entertiner (Realty TV The Apprentice). People are standing up to name-call and insult Trump (fat, diaper poop, orange skin, speeaks funny, all caps Twitter, idiot, dumb, stupid, moron). None of this addresses Surkov information warfare since year 2013. People are inside the simulation, not calling out the origins of the simulation.

Why isn't social media, Reddit / Bluesky, calling every 6 hours for a new posting / hashtag that Trump be impeached. A sustained repeating focus on social media that people want Trump gone. Way bigger than No Kings? My alarming answer is people are extremely addicted (for over 10 years and 5 months) to Trump as a "LOL cow" to milk for memes and entertainment. People who go to meme mills like Bluesky and Reddit but don't wawnt to use information systems to organized sustained online protests. Addicts to the non-boring leadership that Trump provides that Biden did not provide (Biden was boring to meme addicts, antics addicts, Trump provides entertainment thrills).
