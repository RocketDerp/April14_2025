# Social Media Society Did Not

&nbsp;

Social media users, society of social media, the community of social media: DID NOT stand up and call for Dr. Bandy X Lee to be followed. To support Dr. Bandy X. Lee as a leader of dealing with the ult issues, mental health issues of MAGA movement. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017. Social media society did not *rally around serious nonfiction book**.

People like to say "capitalism caused this", which I'm not disagreeing with. But I think "Late stage capitalism" gets plenty of criticism and coverage.

What does not get much criticized is free time / spare time / what passes for entertainment.   
Not much critical thinking.

Donald Trump is an entertainer. People are motivated to hate, meme, mock Donald Trump. This has been going on for a decade since June 16, 2015.

Not reacting to breaking news. Why isn't social media society organizing non-reactions?   
I've seen coverage of "No Kings" protest, but not an online protest.

# So much reaction

Living in USA has been sheer reaction to Donald Trump. I think many have lost sense of life before Donald Trump being the center of attention. The 4 years of Joe Biden were not an escape from Donald Trump, it did not return to year 2012 

The Red Hat MAGA:   
July 2015    
“He came around the corner and we all went, ‘Oh!,’ CNN’s Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. “I really remember it vividly because it was like, ‘Oh, of course, he’s the master marketer. Why wouldn’t he put it on a hat?’”      
“It’s just a disruptive technology,” Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. “People who weren’t involved in politics, that didn’t have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.”
https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/17/politics/donald-trump-make-america-great-again-iconic-hat   

July 2015 is more than 10 years ago as I create this page in August 2015    
Living in a hate-motivated reactionary society. media machines of every size and shape from the largest cloud computing media clusters to all the smartphones people carry... humming with nonstop Donald Trump coverage and fawning. Those who hate Donald Trump and mock Trump promote the same thing as MAGA: mockery and hate.

It has been an ocean of mockery and hate. Mocking MLK Jr's lessons on hate. "Great again" ahs been a complete abandonment, to before 1954 when MLK Jr said all hate is bad. To the 1930's and 1940's industrail machine rise thinking that lead to Japan having aircraft carriers attacking Pearl Harbor with machines to underwater boats, to rocket machines bombing London.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Mueller coming  

The Reddit society adopted chanting like MAGA, such as The Wire TV show fiction phrase taken to "Mueller coming" to give payback on Trump. Reacting to every rumor of Trump impeachment over Russia issues.

Social media did not stand up and shut down entertainment and CALL for. There are people who telephone politicians, representatives, but not a sustained public display that We The People were harmed by Russia and Trumpism and wanted the removal - not on the scale of other social media events like major football games or the release of a major new video game - or outage of a social media platform.

Donald Trump draws haters into reaction, exploits hate mindsets. People seem to drain away any idea of bottom-up progress. The society in total really needs a morality preacher, a MLK Jr. Donald Trump is a force of hate and dehumanization. Worship the rich and wealthy, worship power attraction of Donald Trump. A MLK jr or Malala (Pakistan) force. Jen Senko March 2016, before November 2016, film was not that rise - and it should have been. Jen Senko, the baby boomer who stood up to Fox News, did not get the attention that the topic needed. Just like social media didn't stand for sustained Entertainment "The Apprentice" criticism.

1. [Carl Sagan on Dumb and Dumber year 1995](/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md)
2. Neil Postman, entertaining ourselves to death politics of Ronald Reagan and I vividly remember my high school classes in the 2nd term of Ronald Reagan in 1985. The celebrity charm and worship. Rick Roderick in 1993 saw this with his Duke University students looking back a few short year after... how it was such a Hyper Real social experience.

Donald Trump has made dehumanization and hate "fun" for Americans on a national scale. Trump brought people together in hate motivations, relationships built upon faith in hate. since June 2015. For 10 years and 2 months, hate worship USA.

### Consuming spare time / free time

Putting in the spare time and free time on social media, commenting millions and millions of low-effort no quotations, no author names, no links, no book titles, all on different pages with disposable lifetime... to avoid nonfiction learning and *getting on the same page* and standing up for important and critical goodness.

# November 10, 2025

Monday November 10, 2025 situation    

I agree, "We The People" have not stood up to Fox News (support Jen Senko), we did not stand up to the media addiction / Rescue MAGA / Russian information war. Putin won. People are entertained by Trump, entertainment wins. "No Kings" expressed emotion but it did not present a plan to take on Surkov information warfare / IRA / Fox News addiction / media ecology crisis. People don't even recognize we are in Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" situation around a entertainer (Realty TV The Apprentice). People are standing up to name-call and insult Trump (fat, diaper poop, orange skin, speaks funny, all caps Twitter, idiot, dumb, stupid, moron). None of this addresses Surkov information warfare since year 2013. People are inside the simulation, not calling out the origins of the simulation.

https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFilterNews/comments/1p2zlx1/donald_trump_faces_articles_of_impeachment_before/nq0wz2p/

Why isn't social media, Reddit / Bluesky / Lemmy / Mastodon, calling every 6 hours for a new posting / hashtag that Trump be impeached. A sustained repeating focus on social media that people want Trump gone. Way bigger than No Kings? My alarming answer is people are extremely addicted (for over 10 years and 5 months) to Trump as a "LOL cow" to milk for memes and entertainment. People who go to meme mills like Bluesky and Reddit but don't want to use information systems to organized sustained online protests (serious calls for removal). Addicts to the non-boring leadership that Trump provides that Biden did not provide (Biden was boring to meme addicts, antics addicts, Trump provides stimulation... Trump gives entertainment thrills).

https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1p6h2gs/taylor_swift_branded_a_coward_for_staying_silent/

Front page of Reddit. People calling out the icons they fixate on, status symbols, for not standing up. When did Reddit start a "Day 25 of x until Trump is impeached / removed / Fox News understood as fiction. Cult and fiction addiction problem in USA addressed" posting every 12 hours? People are more concerned about kitten photos, Formula 1 races, and Nintendo Switch 2025 vs. Steam hardware 2025. Trump and MAGA is a global threat to humanity. Russia winning an information war is a threat to all humanism, it is self-harm to even domestic Russia what Surkov unleashed.

TEN FULL YEARS AND SIX MONTHS since June 16, 2015 Trump. And front page of Reddit you see sustained focus on a joke, trivial "chives" movement. Not a call for Donald Trump to be removed from office / MAGA Bible literacy repeating for 66 days. Bible verse "1 John 3:17" lessons to apply to { Musk, Trump, Murdoch, Putin } audiences. Not Bible literacy lessons of verse "1 John 4:20" on prizing hate of Mexicans / immigrants. The sustained focus on social platforms is people flocking to { Formula 1 billionaire petrol consumption / private fleets of jets to fly around cars to race. NFL, NBA, baseball, video games, trivialities }. We The People did not use social media to say "Day 66 of important serious organization to call for Trump removal for the goodness of mankind and future". ... ... ...      

"Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy." ...

# Brainrot Society 47

2026-01-04

Again and again, We The People will not use social media to halt entertainment and tell all children in the entire world that the USA is in trouble and we need mental health professionals to organize around Dr. Bandy X Lee. But instead, we get social media comments like this all the time every day, tree after tree, and nobody seeing the forest problem. Every 47 hour all social media community (on each site) **dedicate between 1 to 4 hours** to make a FAQ / Wiki on what priorities are. The 47 hours being inspired by Trump's term. **The BrainRot Society 47**. And that also shifts it to different times of the day for the whole world to get daytime and nighttime coverage over months and years.

* "It will take 1,128 hours (47 days, or approximately 1.55 months) until every possible hour of the day is covered by a meeting start time." - Google Search summary. 2026-01-04 night USA

* I was thinking the 1 to 4 hours, 60 minutes to 4 hours, could be random? One time the meetings be 1 hour, another 2.5 hours, another 3.5 hours, etc.

* Every meeting assigned a sequence, meeting number 1, 2, 3 and the date and UTC time of the meeting. Like a every 47 hour state of the world wide crisis, state of the We The Social Media Unions. Make a summary of the top 5 issues that meeting, what topics need more attention and assertion. "Brainrot Society Meeting 1, 2026-01-05 05:47 UTC" globally. Every media platform, that time."Brainrot Society Meeting 2, 2026-01-07 04:47 UTC"

# Sunday January 18, 2026 morning

At least a few people notice the absence of pushback to Trump. Cheering on hate isn't pushing back against hate. Corporate Reddit media and Corporate social media engagement runs the nation mindsets, addiction to Trump antics. Trump fandom (fandom of hate, fandom of mockery, fandom of wild and crazy timing of notifications).

https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1qg85ql/trump_creates_his_own_un_countries_must_pay_us1bn/o0ach4p/

It is a TOTAL fandom to hate leadership signals. Trump leads with hate and EVERYONE follows the hate patterns. People have zero self-awareness of the compulsive addiction to Trump's acting. He is the greatest Tony Clifton actor ever!

Also note the reply message about drugs. Everyone on medication to deny reality with chemicals. Like weed / cannabis users who smoke up before going to a science fiction or horror film. Trump entertainment, President Tony Clifton, has them all giggles in the streaming meme audiences. Meds, drugs, brain chemistry dependence. Dr. Bandy X Lee being actively ignored by *We The People* since October 3, 2017 book published.
