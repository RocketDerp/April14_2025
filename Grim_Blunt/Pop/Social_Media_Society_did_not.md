# Social Media Society Did Not

&nbsp;

People like to say "capitalism caused this", which I'm not disagreeing with. But I think "Late stage capitalism" gets plenty of criticism and coverage.

What does not get much criticized is free time / spare time / what pases for entertainment.   
Not much critial thinking.

Donald Trump is an entertainer. People are motivated to hate, meme, mock Donald Trump. This has been going on for a decade sinceJune 2015.

Nott reacting to breaking news. Why isn't social media society organizing non-reactions?   
I've seen coverage of "No Kings" protest, but not an online protest.

# So much reaction

Living in USA has been sheer reaction to Donald Trump. I think many have lost sense of life before Donald Trump being the center of attentin. The 4 years of Joe Biden were not an escape from Donald Trump, it did not return to year 2012 

The Red Hat MAGA:   
July 2015    
“He came around the corner and we all went, ‘Oh!,’ CNN’s Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. “I really remember it vividly because it was like, ‘Oh, of course, he’s the master marketer. Why wouldn’t he put it on a hat?’”      
“It’s just a disruptive technology,” Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. “People who weren’t involved in politics, that didn’t have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.”

July 2015 is more than 10 years ago as I create this page in August 2015    
Living in a hate-motivated reactionary society. media machines of every size and shape from the largest cloud computing media clusters to all the smartphones people carry... humming with nonstop Donald Trump coverage and fawning. Those who hate Donald Trump and mock Trump promote the same thing as MAGA: mockery and hate.

It has been an ocean of mockery and hate. Mocking MLK Jr's lessons on hate. "Great again" ahs been a complete abandonment, to before 1954 when MLK Jr said all hate is bad. To the 1930's and 1940's industrail machine rise thinking that lead to Japan having aircraft carriers attacking Pearl Harbor with machines to underwater boats, to rocket machines bombing London.
