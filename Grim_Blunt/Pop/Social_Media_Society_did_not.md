# Social Media Society Did Not

&nbsp;

People like to say "capitalism caused this", which I'm not disagreeing with. But I think "Late stage capitalism" gets plenty of criticism and coverage.

What does not get much criticized is free time / spare time / what pases for entertainment.   
Not much critial thinking.

Donald Trump is an entertainer. People are motivated to hate, meme, mock Donald Trump. This has been going on for a decade sinceJune 2015.

Nott reacting to breaking news. Why isn't social media society organizing non-reactions?   
I've seen coverage of "No Kings" protest, but not an online protest.

# So much reaction

Living in USA has been sheer reaction to Donald Trump. I think many have lost sense of life before Donald Trump being the center of attentin. The 4 years of Joe Biden were not an escape from Donald Trump, it did not return to year 2012 

The Red Hat MAGA:   
July 2015    
“He came around the corner and we all went, ‘Oh!,’ CNN’s Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, who covered the event, remembered. “I really remember it vividly because it was like, ‘Oh, of course, he’s the master marketer. Why wouldn’t he put it on a hat?’”      
“It’s just a disruptive technology,” Lewandowski told CNN of the campaign hats. “People who weren’t involved in politics, that didn’t have a political background, wanted to show their support for something different and their way to do that was to buy hats.”

July 2015 is more than 10 years ago as I create this page in August 2015    
Living in a hate-motivated reactionary society. media machines of every size and shape from the largest cloud computing media clusters to all the smartphones people carry... humming with nonstop Donald Trump coverage and fawning. Those who hate Donald Trump and mock Trump promote the same thing as MAGA: mockery and hate.

It has been an ocean of mockery and hate. Mocking MLK Jr's lessons on hate. "Great again" ahs been a complete abandonment, to before 1954 when MLK Jr said all hate is bad. To the 1930's and 1940's industrail machine rise thinking that lead to Japan having aircraft carriers attacking Pearl Harbor with machines to underwater boats, to rocket machines bombing London.

### Mueller coming  

The Reddit society adopted chanting like MAAGA, such as The Wire TV show fiction phrase taken to "Mueller coming" to give payback on Trump. Reacting to every rumor of Trump impeachment over Russia issues. 

Soccial media did not stand up and shut down entertainment and CALL for. There are people who telephpone politicians, representatives, but not a dispaly that We The People were harmed by Russia and Trumpism and wanted the removal - not on the scale of other social media events like major football games or the release of a major new video game - or outage of a social media platform.

Donald Trumpdraws haters into reaction, exploits hate mindsets. People seem to drain away any idea of bottom-up progress. The society in total realy needs a morality preacher, a MLK Jr. Donald Trump is a force of hate and dehumanization. Worship the rich and wealthy, worship power attraction of Donald Trump. A MLK jr or Malala (Pakistan) force.  Jen Senko March 2016, before November 2016, film was not that rise - and it should have been. Jen Senko, the baby boomer who stood up to Fox News, did not get the attention that the topic needed. Just like social media didn't stand for sustained Entertainment "The Apprentice" crticisim.

1. Carl Sagan on Dumb and Dumber
2. Neil Postman, entertaining ourselves to death politics of Ronald Regan and I vidily remember my high school classs in the 2nd term of Ronald Reagan in 1985. The celebrity charm and worship. Rick Roderick in 1993 saw this with his Duke University students looking back a few short year after... how it was such a Hyper Real social experience.

Donald Trump has made dehumanization and hate "fun" for Americans on a national scale. Trump brought people together in hate motivations, relationships built upon faith in hate. since June 2015. For 10 years and 2 months, hate worship USA.
