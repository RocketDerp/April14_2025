I, Stephen Alfred Gutknecht, am a clear loser as Donald Trump defines it.

I have never called a human being a "loser" in the way Donald Trump does, that I recall. I have described ideas as stupid, but I don't evne like to call people stupid or idiots. Because I think people do not analyze education at the level Malala does. 

Deeply I have felt along the same lines as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr: "I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few."

I am clearly one of those 'Losers' + 'Suckers' Trump calls out. I have never been able to get crowds of people on social media or in person to listen and hang on my every world (word) like Donald Trump does.

Since Trump is incredibly **popular** and constantly the center of society attention, I am factually the loser. The crowd has spoken.
