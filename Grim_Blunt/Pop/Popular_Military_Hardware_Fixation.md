# Software Brainware 

Americans are so FIXATED on #military hardware, machine **hardware**, of physical guns. They can name every technical detail about a gun machine, but can't name **Rupert Murdoch** and **Internet Research Agency**  

**Media Ecology Crisis** /\

If it weren't for fiction films like James Bond, people in USA proabably couldn't even NAME the KGB. There is no concept of brainwar / mindwar / "winning hearts and minds of the enemy" and the names of famous agencies. But people can describe gun ammunition in USA technicals.
