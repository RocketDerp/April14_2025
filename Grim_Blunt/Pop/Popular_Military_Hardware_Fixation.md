# Software Brainware 

Americans are so FIXATED on **military** hardware, machine **hardware**, of physical guns. They can name every technical detail about a gun machine, but can't name **Rupert Murdoch** and **Internet Research Agency**  

**Media Ecology Crisis** /\

If it weren't for fiction films like James Bond, people in USA proabably couldn't even NAME the KGB. Many today in 2025 cannot name "FSB" or "Surkov". There is no concept of brainwar / mindwar / "winning hearts and minds of the enemy" and the names of famous agencies. But people can describe gun ammunition in USA technicals.

# Individual Person Paradox

People in USA who think a SINGLE PERSON is their savior, Donald Trump the one and only individual person who can save the USA... can't even NAME "Surkov" as a *person* that defeated the USA. Despite Surkov directly mocking and addressing We The People. Februiary 2019: https://www.newsweek.com/russia-president-vladimir-putin-election-americans-1327793

People in USA repeat Donald Trump names, and all the nicknames of orange they hae created for Trump, but can not NAME their enemy or even the "Internet Research Agency" enemy organization! This paradox is STARING THE USA IN THE FACE. No global view perspective. Americans are self-focused. Surkov won!

Despite the worship of the person Donald Trump for his creative non-politician approach, people in USA can't even name their enemy who uses creative non-politician approaches!

People USED TO BE ABLE TO NAME Ossma Bin Ladden in year 2002, even though OBL did not do the terrorist attacks. But people can not name Surkov for putting Trump and Ukraine mind-fucking into USA population. Russian mind-fuck terrorist leaders are not named, but Islamic Muslim terrorist leaders ARE known names / household names! NOBODY SEES THIS PARADOX!
