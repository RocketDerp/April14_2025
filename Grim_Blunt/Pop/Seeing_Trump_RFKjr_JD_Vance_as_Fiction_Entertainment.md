Diary Of RoundSparrow Friday Levant Quran Day September 5, 2025

Here in USA 2025, I constantly hear people say to each other: Dumb, stupid, idiot, ignorant, uneducated, moron.

What I do NOT hear: Fiction vs. nonfiction. No matter how smart a person is, no matter their learned education... if people believe what they are watching on TV is "fiction", they allow it. "Hunger Games USA 2025" RFK Jr / Trump / Putin.

CONVINCE EVERYDAY PEOPLE that Donald Trump is "orange skin" fiction, and they let Trump do anything! Because in fiction film and fiction television shows, nothing is reality. The more absurd and surreal that RFK Jr and Donald Trump and JD Vance behave, the more USA audience (We The People) treat it like entertainment fiction. People are glued to social touchscreens mocking away and insulting Tony Clifton performances. Because in a movie cinema - wild and crazy storytelling is allowed.

This isn't about how smart people are, it's about how much addicted they are to entertainment. That is Donald Trump's power over USA society.

### ***Year 2014***

"Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way.

He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics.

His aim is to undermine peoples' perceptions of the world, so they never know what is really happening.

Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater."

### ***Year 1985***

“When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business
