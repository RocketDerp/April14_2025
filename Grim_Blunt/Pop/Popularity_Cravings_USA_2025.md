# Since Year 2015

Once I realized that the media ecology crisis of MAGA and Donald Trump was not a temporary phase, not just a season but a long-term trend I had been witnessing. That it was deep, deep into the human subconsious...

# My voice

My writings is bloated, repetitive, "ranting" is an insult people use to silence you and dismiss you.

I am so brain damaged by the social enviornment of USA since year 2014. What [Donald Trump set in motion November 2012](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/), and Russia started as [active measures in March 2013 into media systems](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america) has destroyed almost every bit of goodness from me.

The message from RFK Jr is clear, autistic people who can't go with the system of mass dehumanization and anti-science should be stress into death with "autism camps".

Social media users can't stand anyone who doesn't conform to the meme of the month style of communications.

I clearly witness the desires of USA society 2025: dehumanize those who disagree. That's the core values, hate and dehumanization. Donald Trump leads everyone, all inclusive, you have to be entirely unable to communicate to not see the anti-huamnism values.

# Quotes

I have done for years and years since 2015 where what I did was just quote authors and quote books. And people would deny their relevant context to the Donald Trump forest situation since 2015. People would stop calling the writing ranting (because it was from authors, not my own writing), but still not enage the concept or idea.

#### Repulsive ideas

Malala's word stage presence parallels the rise of Donald Trump. Her book published October 8, 2013.

I keep searching and searching for social media users to say:

1. We need to stop repeating Putin and instead repeat Malala and give her the microphone. Her ideas are excellent, Putin's ideas are self-harm to all humanity.

2. Epstein and young girls and sexual domination and exploitation of the *power* of women / girls and sex. Malala has a lot to say about child marriage and elderly, established, powerful men using media systems of Radio (Radio Mullah) and Quran media system to manipulate young girls (and their parents) into self-harm.

3. We need to stop repeating MAGA and Donald Trump and instead repeat Malala and give her the microphone. Her ideas are excellent, Trump's ideas are self-harm to all humanity.

4. School is not where adults learn, adults learn from Fox News / Newsmax / Twitter / Reddit / Bluesky / media systems. Media systems are our teachers and educators, age 16 classroom educaiton is not retained. We need to repeat Jen Senko since March 2016, a baby boomer who stood up on the world stage and called out the impact of content. We need to face up that media makes our society. People believe information based on *how it is presented*, not based on fact-checking and truth. Jen Senko is a hero for standing up against her fellow boomers, and social media socity has not repeated and kept repeating her name and message.

But I do not witness it. People criticize my voice, wish me silent, wish me to shut up. But why are they not repeating Malala and Jen Senko? Why not dusting off Carl Sagan 1995 book every day and repeating that this is improtant to grasp and we need to change paths and direction? Why is Neil Postman not being repeated and repeated like people repeat information about sports teams and sprots games?

# Abandonment of Truth, Giving up on Science  

Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan came to world attention 2012 - and her blogs went back years before that, so you could read what she had to say even though she was in the hospital being treated for her gunshots.

Malala's book was published October 8, 2013 - and it is full of words about science truth, education, learning, and interpretation of poetry of the Quran storytelling (which is imported from very far away, Mecca is across the world from Swat Valley, Pakistan - similar to how California USA is far away from Bible origins in the Levant).

### Monday August 4, 2025 Trump fiction

https://old.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/1mhhtm0/trumps_plan_in_simple_words/

Fiction outsells nonfiction. Style of presentation triumps over reality and truth and compassion. People thrilled at being able to manipulate via advertising, marketing, and systemic influence (government information systems of reporting jobs in this Reddit (and other media platform Twitter content) posting topic).

### Treating this as a world-wide conservative international unreality

The global war against reality, against science, against underrstanding - in favor of fiction. Conservative International 2013 movement.

1. Menace of Unreality described to the world September 9, 2014 - more than a decade ago. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

2. Look back a year before that publication at December 20, 2013 publication about how this was an international movement. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

3. Evidence going back to 2014 Twitter messages seeding unreality, fiction, against science on medical diseases, measles and COVID-19: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 -- validated by Johns Hipkins University and George Washington University. **Again, factual evidence gong back to year 2014**.

See what we have been swiming in since 2013? We are swiming upstream and the billionaires of the world are dumping falsehoods and **exploiting fiction addictions** since year 2013.

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. Published October 8, 2013

So we have known that fiction Quran storytelling was being used this way in far-away place of Swat Valley, Pakistan. And we have known of the Fox News network problem. And here it was leveled up formally as a globla international network (see #2 on list above).
