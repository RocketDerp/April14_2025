Diary Of RoundSparrow 

My mother was an alcoholic and cigarette smoker. I sometimes wonder if I would have been able to cope with things like she did if I had taken up smoking and drinking every day. She managed in the world better than I did mentally.  I took up listening instead of booze and cigs.

Listening to people and thinking about what they say, write, communicate is incredibly painful. You eventually come to realize that people are not listening for understanding. Compassion is not a common ground, compassion is not on the agenda of most people listening. Power and wealth are.

When people blame "the media", "the mainstream media",  especially in the USA , especially the past 40 years (since 1985)... there is no sense of listening. In USA, we have tens of thousands of choices of "media", and the shit people flock to is the smelliest waste shit. Crowds do not listen, audiences react.

In the past few years in USA, the term "vibe" has become common way to describe the situation. "vibe coding" for software generation. "vibe politics"

As an autistic person, communications input/output disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder 

I can listen to people and think a lot about how we communicate and say: "vibe media consumption" to "the news", "the mainstream media" - vibe media consumption.  Very reactionary, shallow, superficial, clickbait. Baited by vibe clicking. Baited by vibe like Fox News and Joe Rogan "vibe media".

Donald Trump is the most charming person to ever communicate in North America because he is a master of "vibe communications". Donald Trump can spot what "gets under people's skin" from miles and miles. Donald Trump knows how to irritate people's mind into addiction to media. Donald Trump is walking talking vibe clickbait meme addiction personified. Donald Trump is "vibe mainstream media".

The problem is the audience. Not just voters. But Tony Clifton audience who seeks the "vibes" of Donald Trump getting under their skin. The power of Donald Trump is button-pushing the emotions of mob mentality, emotional button pushing of the worst kind. Donald Trump vibe i self-harm of the mass mind.
