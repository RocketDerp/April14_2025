# Grim Blunt July 13, 2025

The grim reality real of it all.   
The war against reality is lost.  
Russia may win or lose against Ukraine, but this went on since Operation Matthew 4:19 was initiated in November 2008, since [Surkov went to London for his speech May 1, 2013](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2013/05/14/after-surkov-a24031) - and the Internet Research Agency spooled up in March 2013. The Ukraine wwar of February 2014 onward was active measures.

### Palestine dreams

I lived in Amman Jordan from March 2011 during the Arab Spring analyzing and thinking a lot about what was to come. I had predicted the Arab Spring on December 16, 2009 and traveled to Algeria at the start of December 2010.

I lived in the basement of a Church (studio apartment) in an Islamic nation with a King and Queen. 

Is Palestine living the October 7, 2023 dream? Is all the death and destruction part of the stairway to heaven. Malalal's book came out one decade earlier, October 8 2013 - and I sure did not witness any of my Arab Spring social media observation points showing Malala being repeated. I do not witness protests signs since 2023 popularity of Israel and Palestine saying: We all need Malala's words and ideals!

So the dreams in Palestine is largely *heaven after death*.

 # Neil Postman

 Neil Postman 1985 was correct.   
 Neil Postman 1992 had many great points.  
 Neil Postman September 1995 was spot on about learning.  
 Carl Sagan in January 1994 brought up media.  
 Carl Sagan in 1995 brought up media, confirming Postamn.   
 Rick Roderick in 1993 didn't make a reference to Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman and went an entirely different path to many of the same conclusions.

 # Fatal Stategies

The grim blunt *Fatal Strategies* is that Jean B was correct. We can't stop this, especially not USA of my lifetime / before climate change 2045 becomes more seriously realized.

Americans will die for their fiction. To me, this is about fiction vs. nonfiction, and what has happened in July 2025 alone has shown how addicted social media consumers (electric media users, people who "read the news" and read social media content, which are entertangled).. will die for and harm others for entertainment.

That's why I mentioned Palestine before, Mecca is a Quran theme park as Disney has content theme parks. There is no supernatural. Quran and Mecca are the *newest*, at year 630, of the Levant enteratinment *heaven awaits* science fiction storytelling media empires. And Rupert Murdoch was building one close to, that complemented Disney (and George Lucas and Fox / The Simpsons / etc converged on Disney)...

### Pandemic 2019 not Hypothetical 

The [August 24, 2018 Johns Hopkins University and George Washington University](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192) only focused on a tiny amount of Twitter since year 2014, but the evidence was real, the IP addresses and browser footprints validated. Facebook, Reddit, etc not checked at all in this report,and [only 1% of social accounts were recognized as Russian IRA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) (and whatever other names and organizatons and Steve Bannon / Rupert Murdoch / Elon Musk / whoever partnerships).

### October 7 2023 Terrorism not Hypothetical

An innteligence faiure on the scale of September 11, 2001 was not hypothetical, it really happened on Putin's birthday in year 2023.

## Fatal Strategies 1993

Part 8 of 8 in "Self Under Siege" 1993    
https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

"Baudrillard says its best at this point to simply face it. That what we are witnessing is the end of the world. The end of human beings. And he thinks that there’s no reason to be sad or upset or cynical about it. In fact Baudrillard calls it The Ecstasy of Communication. I mean, I am trying to do this in a kind of ironic way. I don’t know how one presents this kind of material." - Rick Roderick, 1993

&nbsp;

I've been upset about it since December 2009 and even more so since March 2013 when Reddit started to change and by 2015 I was fully alarmed that it was a huge deal (and I contacted Samantha at the Pentagon).
