# Grim Blunt July 13, 2025

&nbsp;

The grim reality real of it all.   
The war against reality is lost.  
Russia may win or lose against Ukraine, but this went on since Operation Matthew 4:19 was initiated in November 2008, since [Surkov went to London for his speech May 1, 2013](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2013/05/14/after-surkov-a24031) - and the Internet Research Agency spooled up in March 2013. The Ukraine wwar of February 2014 onward was active measures.

### Palestine dreams

I lived in Amman Jordan from March 2011 during the Arab Spring analyzing and thinking a lot about what was to come. I had predicted the Arab Spring on December 16, 2009 and traveled to Algeria at the start of December 2010.

I lived in the basement of a Church (studio apartment) in an Islamic nation with a King and Queen. 

Is Palestine living the October 7, 2023 dream? Is all the death and destruction part of the stairway to heaven. Malalal's book came out one decade earlier, October 8 2013 - and I sure did not witness any of my Arab Spring social media observation points showing Malala being repeated. I do not witness protests signs since 2023 popularity of Israel and Palestine saying: We all need Malala's words and ideals!

So the dreams in Palestine is largely *heaven after death*.

 Peter Pomerantsev has risked his life in travel and confronting egoism.

 # Neil Postman

 Neil Postman 1985 was correct.   
 Neil Postman 1992 had many great points.  
 Neil Postman September 1995 was spot on about learning.  
 Carl Sagan in January 1994 brought up media.  
 Carl Sagan in 1995 brought up media, confirming Postamn.   
 Rick Roderick in 1993 didn't make a reference to Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman and went an entirely different path to many of the same conclusions.

 # Fatal Strategies

The grim blunt *Fatal Strategies* is that Jean B was correct. We can't stop this, especially not USA of my lifetime / before climate change 2045 becomes more seriously realized.

Americans will die for their fiction. To me, this is about fiction vs. nonfiction, and what has happened in July 2025 alone has shown how addicted social media consumers (electric media users, people who "read the news" and read social media content, which are entertangled).. will die for and harm others for entertainment.

That's why I mentioned Palestine before, Mecca is a Quran theme park as Disney has content theme parks. There is no supernatural. Quran and Mecca are the *newest*, at year 630, of the Levant entertainment *heaven awaits* science fiction storytelling media empires. And Rupert Murdoch was building one close to, that complemented Disney (and George Lucas and Fox / The Simpsons / etc converged on Disney)...

### Pandemic 2019 not Hypothetical 

The [August 24, 2018 Johns Hopkins University and George Washington University](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192) only focused on a tiny amount of Twitter since year 2014, but the evidence was real, the IP addresses and browser footprints validated. Facebook, Reddit, etc not checked at all in this report,and [only 1% of social accounts were recognized as Russian IRA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/16/russia-disinformation-discord-leaked-documents/) (and whatever other names and organizations and Steve Bannon / Rupert Murdoch / Elon Musk / whoever partnerships).

&nbsp;

### October 7 2023 Terrorism not Hypothetical

An intelligence failure on the scale of September 11, 2001 was not hypothetical, it really happened on Putin's birthday in year 2023.

## Fatal Strategies 1993

Part 8 of 8 in "Self Under Siege" 1993    
https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

"Baudrillard says its best at this point to simply face it. That what we are witnessing is the end of the world. The end of human beings. And he thinks that there’s no reason to be sad or upset or cynical about it. In fact Baudrillard calls it The Ecstasy of Communication. I mean, I am trying to do this in a kind of ironic way. I don’t know how one presents this kind of material." - Rick Roderick, 1993

&nbsp;

I've been upset about it since December 2009 and even more so since March 2013 when Reddit started to change and by 2015 I was fully alarmed that it was a huge deal (and I contacted Samantha at the Pentagon; Monday, August 17, 2015 afternoon).

# Why July 13, 2025?

&nbsp;

1. June 22, 2025 "Operation Midnight Hammer" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites

The way profesisonal jouralists / reporters / writers / analysis analyzed this. The way social media voters (likes), repeated / shared, reacted to all this. Reality is gone. People in USA are indeed willing to die for hyper reality as Rick Roderick worried about the future in 1993.

Empahsis on him not buying yet into it in 1993 (nor would I have in 1993, Eternal September), his children's time:

"In any case, ah, if Baudrillard is even onto something, what the postmodern trajectory means is that the self is not under siege, it’s lost. It’s just lost. And if that’s true then all of the strategies by which ordinary people try to live decent good lives are lost along with it. **I am not necessarily going to buy that right away, I am really not.** I do think that the new, ah, technologies are going to call forth… I mean this is why the title of this course has been “The Self Under Siege”. If I didn’t think it was **a real, virulent technological siege** and just some thought up philosopher’s dream, which would not have interested me. I mean, I have no interest in that. I mean, what I am interested in is what is changing the lives **of my children and your children** and so on. What will shape culture and… what we used to call society and culture and history. That’s what I am interested in. If it is the end of the world, I want to know, so that my kids and I can enjoy the apocalypse together." - Rick Roderick, 1993

&nbsp;

In December 2009, I was damn worried, and again - I contacted the Pentagon August 17, 2015.
