The grim reality real of it all.   
The war against reality is lost.  
Russia may win or lose against Ukraine, but this went on since Operation Matthew 4:19 was initiated in November 2008, since [Surkov went to London for his speech May 1, 2013](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2013/05/14/after-surkov-a24031) - and the Internet Research Agency spooled up in March 2013. The Ukraine wwar of February 2014 onward was active measures.

### Palestine dreams

I lived in Amman Jordan from March 2011 during the Arab Spring analyzing and thinking a lot about what was to come. I had predicted the Arab Spring on December 16, 2009 and traveled to Algeria at the start of December 2010.

I lived in the basement of a Church (studio apartment) in an Islamic nation with a King and Queen. 

Is Palestine living the October 7, 2023 dream? Is all the death and destruction part of the stairway to heaven. Malalal's book came out one decade earlier, October 8 2013 - and I sure did not witness any of my Arab Spring social media observation points showing Malala being repeated. I do not witness protests signs since 2023 popularity of Israel and Palestine saying: We all need Malala's words and ideals!

So the dreams in Palestine is largely *heaven after death*.

 # Neil Postman

 Neil Postman 1985 was correct.   
 Neil Postman 1992 had many great points.  
 Neil Postman September 1995 was spot on about learning.  
 Carl Sagan in January 1994 brought up media.  
 Carl Sagan in 1995 brought up media, confirming Postamn.   
 Rick Roderick in 1993 didn't make a reference to Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman and went an entirely different path to many of the same conclusions.
