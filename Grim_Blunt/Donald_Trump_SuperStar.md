## King of Pop

"Donald Trump Superstar"

Donald Trump is [KING OF POP](https://www.michaeljackson.com/news/why-michael-jackson-is-known-as-the-king-of-pop/)!

Donald Trump is POPULARITY ITSELF. No person has ever been more popularity of hate and mass dehumanization for people to bow down and throw their hate messages into the wishing well.

Lyrics:
"If you'd come today you could have reached a whole nation.
Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication." #Israel  

2,029 years ago in year -4 the Levant / Holy Lands had no mass communications TCP/IP Internet media, the media, social media, news media. Donald Trump is King of Pop!

P.S. I was there in Bellevue Washington when the [Museum of Pop Culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmQr3rsC-vk) was being developed, running the museum development social media systems for Paul Allen Group. Neil Postman was still alive and I had time to research anything I wanted while quietly sitting in my office. The nightmare was unfolding. NFL sports, NBA team, app empire, the rescue of Apple Computers by Bill Gates and the creation of 99 cents music store to come. The creation of a Microsoft cable TV news network like Elon Musk purchasing Twitter. Bellevue was the hub to research the hell out of events with AT&T office one floor away from Paul Allen's office, we had datacenter Internet at our desk. Jemi Hendrix, Woodstock 1969 forever. Not this Trumpism shit.
