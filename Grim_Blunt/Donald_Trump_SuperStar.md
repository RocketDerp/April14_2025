## King of Pop

&nbsp;

"Donald Trump Superstar"

Donald Trump is [KING OF POP](https://www.michaeljackson.com/news/why-michael-jackson-is-known-as-the-king-of-pop/)!

Donald Trump is POPULARITY ITSELF. No person has ever been more popularity of hate and mass dehumanization for people to bow down and throw their hate messages into the wishing well.

Lyrics:
["If you'd come today you could have reached a whole nation.
Israel in 4 BC had no mass communication."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJDgUoAQC8Y

P.S. I was there in Bellevue Washington when the [Museum of Pop Culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmQr3rsC-vk) was being developed, running the museum development social media systems for Paul Allen Group. Neil Postman was still alive and I had time to research anything I wanted while quietly sitting in my office. The [nightmare was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s) seeding. NFL sports, NBA team, app empire, fleetp of private [jets](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/entertainment/article/3269337/donald-trumps-private-jet-really-crappy-and-dilapidated-former-presidents-plane-dubbed-trump-force) and cruise [ships[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_(yacht)), the [rescue of Apple Computers by Bill Gates](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-what-happened-when-microsoft-saved-apple.html) and the creation of 99 cents music store iPod culture to come, [Dreamworks](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-aug-07-fi-dreamworks7-story.html), Hollywood [stars](https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-allen-cannes-yacht-party-2015-5). The creation of a [Microsoft cable TV news network](https://www.eweek.com/cloud/why-microsoft-s-16-year-experiment-with-msnbc.com-ended/) like Elon Musk purchasing Twitter ([October 7](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4296326-hamass-oct-7-birthday-gift-to-putin/), 1996 was when Fox News went online). Bellevue was the hub to research the hell out of events with AT&T office one floor away from Paul Allen's office, we had datacenter Internet at our desk. Jemi Hendrix, Woodstock 1969 forever. Not this Trumpism MAGA shit. Some of us have not forgotten the [Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents) nightmare that hollowed out the intellectual development of young people to be closed-source *consumers* of computers instead of open souce free thinking *rulers* of computers.
