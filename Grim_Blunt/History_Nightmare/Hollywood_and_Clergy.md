# Hollywood and Clergy

Steely Dan's Caves of Altamira context

Clergy uses science fiction: Torah, Upanishads, Quran, Bible, Buddha 

So it's always been Hollywood fiction as a teaching tool of compassio and love.

Yoga isn't fiction, it is ritul and physical. 

My stance is that marriage rituals rose up all across the world because popular men could easiily impregnate women and didn't fully comprehend the 9 month pregnancy cycle and 15 years of raising a child to maturity. And rituls of weddings and marriage were divsed to educate and teach responsibilty. Biological drivey by pregnancy / child rearing responsibility for shelter and food.
