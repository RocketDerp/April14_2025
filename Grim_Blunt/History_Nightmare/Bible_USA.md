# History Nightmare

“History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.”
― James Joyce, Ulysses

# Bible in USA

It is self-evident that The Bible and Church are well-known in the United States of America.

## Cherry-picking

What is most alarming is the horrifically bad cherry-picking that goes on.

Why can nobody say "it is a fiction book, and I enjoy many fiction TV shows, fiction books, fiction films. And my favorite passage in The Bible is..."

For all the poetry in that book, and as well known as the book can be, why is it that we land on so many terrible bad leaders who are not openly confronted with better literacy, cherry-picking of actual goodness?

It is a story from thousands of years ago, more written about it than some modern favorite fiction like Harry Potter book or Back to the Future film.

If your favorite part of the story is that there is a heaven after death and everything on Earth is temporary and that justifies our behavior... it's alarming.

Why can't people in North America find Bible verse "1 John 3:17" and say that is their favorite verse in the face of Donald Trump and MAGA movement?

## Not just one book

If we can't find the goodness in a book people claim is important and assert the goodness....

The same behavior towards other teaching and education systems is happening.

Every invention or story, we watch as the most harmful parts are what people choose as their general favorite.

How else do you end up with MAGA and Donald Trump as a leader except for a people who favor badness itself?

And you see this favoring of badness in so many areas when people pick and choose.

### writing

I've tried to write this thousands of times since year 2014 as to the trending popularity, the social media trending, the growing popularity of dehumanization in USA.

I just do not find hate to be enjoyable. Hate upon Donald Trump does not pleasure me like it seems to so many people on Reddit and Bluesky and everywhere really.

Being in MAGA is a hate club. Hating upon MAGA is a hate club. It is saturating hate since year 2014 and 2015 when it became apparent this was not a fad or short-term trend.

Do people not get ENOUGH of this hate? Donald Trump creatively originating a new initiative of hate, and then people hating upon Donald Trump. Wave after wave of hate motivations.

Why are people not addressing hate itself? Badness itself? And REMOVING Donald Trump... instead of adding compulsive hate like a alcoholic who drinks more and more toxic brain damage every day. 

Donald Trump trusts Putin. He has trusted Putin since year 2012 (at least) and praises Putin and how Russia is run. Why can't people call that out, saying trusting Putin is a bad idea, and that is what Trump has done.

Instead of removing Trump, he is a punching bag for people who seem to enjoy hate itself, enjoy punching on Donald Trump instead of removing the entire sport of terrible horrific leaders making self-harm choices for future of USA.

Faith in hate itself, I just find it terrible. REMOVE Donald Trump, stop hating and be serious and REMOVE him. Stop being addicted to the self-harm to insult and mock. Stop being addicted to hate upon Donald Trump, REMOVE Donald Trump from power and leadership. Other people can do the job as President of the USA.

By showing faith in hate, hating on Donald Trump, we have adopted the hate values of MAGA. We are a nation addicted to hate itself.

I find it all sickening.

Donald Trump poses with a Bible for photograph, why can't people find verse Matthew 6:5 and speak up that this is not a good thing. Why can nobody find any actual good verses in such an established book. The clergy isn't correcting ignorant Donald Trump, nor are We The People (who can read the book and find Matthew 6:5).

Why would people rather insult and hate upon Donald Trump than REMOVE him by making verse Matthew 6:5 a topic of trending social media?

It has gone on so long, over 10 years of people enjoying hate upon Donald Trump instead of condemning hate itself.

Drowned in an ocean of people who have faith in hate, hate as the core of their desires. Very sickening since year 2015 in USA.

the normalization of Donald Trump every day since his Twitter 2012 hate upon the nation. His 2015 running for the White House. The hate inspires more hate every day, it worsens and worsens. Here in August 2025, it has been saturating for so long, people promoting violence and hate and dehumanization constantly, all the time, you can almost bet that the next day with be a new creative form of hate to add to all the Donlad Trump inspired hate values people have cherished. 

Remove Trump, remove hate itself, we had more thn enough by July 2016 - people being inspired by hate and dehumanizaiton just won't stop.
