Why don't we, hummanity, have world peace.

People act like it is circumstances, but it really all comes down to attitudes and education.

Gangs in Hatina cities.

People not willing to share food, afraid to create dependence or warlords.   

People not willing to study psycology of domestic violence.  

People who think love and kindness is dumb, boring, stupid, or worthless to learn.   

People who find entertainment in fireworks displays, building collapses, fires, bomb explosions, natural disasters. 

People mislead by parents and clergy to trust in heaven after death.

I'm way too exhausted to write this. Repulsive to even describe what is going on in United States of America in Septeber 2025 and witnessing how many people do not understand how good the USA has hadlife since 1950 and progress thorugh civil rights reform, technology advancements, Woodstock 1969 mind mapping of ideals and dreams, to now find people who think high schores of bank account on a Bloomberg terminal is the only interesting an attractive game in town. Vot for your favorite sports star an favorete wealth stars. And I eman vote daily spare time and free time of social media and news consumtpion, not just elections.
