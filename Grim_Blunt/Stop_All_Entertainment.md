Be serious and sustain serious on social media. People not participating on social media, start participating in a fashion of sounding alarm, posting repeat alerts.

# What to Message

&nbsp;

1. You have studied the Ukraine war since it started in February 2014, and you can see the pattern of Russia using falsehood, lies, information manipulation, mind games. [This story about Putin's Russia was published September 9, 2014 - and you have read it](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). Quote it. Repeat it, repeat several times a week on social media that you are alarmed this is what you are experiencing with Donald Trump and White House since January 2025.

2. Do not insult and mock MAGA. Stop all mocking.

3. Instead of mocking MAGA and Donald Trump, post examples of "Menace of Unreality" behavior. How you witness people who seem to be consuming false information and repeating it, paraphrasing misunderstandings in their own words. Make this a topic about Russian war against Reality that started with the Ukraine war in 2014, not about insulting and mocking MAGA and dumb stupid idiots, but that we were outsmarted by Russia and you are alarmed, disturbed, concerned, and seeking people to be serious about the topic.
