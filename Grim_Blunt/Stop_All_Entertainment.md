# Stop All Entertainment

Be serious and sustain serious on social media. People not participating on social media, start participating in a fashion of sounding alarm, posting repeat alerts.

Why? Please take 6 to 12 minutes:

1. Recommended 6 minute video: **Amusing Ourselves to Death** 1985 book, modern introduction on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETUGwC9jXCM

2. Recommend reading from March 27, 2024 - before the November 2024 election. https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/

### Call for Intellectual Arms, being serious

Cut out sports entertainment topics, video game topics, clear the media airwaves for serious factual discussion. Call for people to "end mental denial" of how bad things have become. Show concern that people are treating the White House as amusing and entertaining, that people are *enjoying* insulting and mocking Donald Trump, Elon Musk, JD Vance - and it is time to be serious and cut down the less-important amusement and entertainment topics in favor of people getting on the same page that it is a civic duty to understand and comprehend the changes in society.

# What to Message

&nbsp;

1. You have studied the Ukraine war since it started in February 2014, and you can see the pattern of Russia using falsehood, lies, information manipulation, mind games. [This story about Putin's Russia was published September 9, 2014 - and you have read it](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). Quote it. Repeat it, repeat several times a week on social media that you are alarmed this is what you are experiencing with Donald Trump and White House since January 2025.

2. Do not insult and mock MAGA. Stop all mocking.

3. Instead of mocking MAGA and Donald Trump, post examples of "Menace of Unreality" behavior. How you witness people who seem to be consuming false information and repeating it, paraphrasing misunderstandings in their own words. Make this a topic about Russian war against Reality that started with the Ukraine war in 2014, not about insulting and mocking MAGA and dumb stupid idiots, but that we were outsmarted by Russia and you are alarmed, disturbed, concerned, and seeking people to be serious about the topic.

4. Make Neil Postman 1985 book a household name. His 1992 book, his September 1995 book. There are YouTube videos, books to quote. Make this about words of a dead man, a forgotten American, and how the Apple iPhone and iPad and Internet have changed everything. Don't make this about Donald Trump and MAGA, make this about *rescuing America* from a media feedback loop, Internet-driven "the media" social media total mockery.

5. If you raelly dislike Neil Postman or such, try Texan Rick Roderick of Duke University 1993 for your study and material to repeat / perspective. He too is another dead man, a forgotten American, who has a lot to say about our August 2025 situation in USA. Video and transcript: https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

## Toxic society, angry people, stress

It doesn't matter if you are a non-believer or atheist.

Point out that the USA Constitutions does not say "love one another", or promote compassion. And that since people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr came on the world stage in 1950's shortly after World War Two, it is a very important topic. 

Keep pointing out that the law doesn't say "love your neighbor", "love your enemy", "love one another". And that is what you are standing up for. It isn't in the laws. It is something the Church used to teach and understand, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr was *part of that church*... but how is teaching it today in 2025? It is your civic duty to *point out* that life isn't enjoyable when people are waging war, such as Russia bombing Ukraine from the sky, and love and compassion teaching has to come from somewhere if the Church of 1954 is no longer around - then it is our civic duty on social media to speak up and assert, repeating.

Do you really want to live in a heartless nation of bullies and haters who only love people they agree with because they all watch the same television news network? Love actually *does matter* for strangers. Medical services, safe food, decent housing. Do we really want to live in a nation of people trying to constantly trick each other out of their bank account money, manipulating the elderly and overworked minds in society, with artificial intelligence systems sending us fake information and people playing scams on us all the time? It takes a lot of fun and joy out of society when everyone is a shady salesperson or scammer trying to screw over their neighbors and fellow Americans.
