# Decline of mindsets 

Reactionary mindset, conditioned training to be reactive. 

1. Neil Postman
2. Carl Sagan
3. David Foster Wallace

Exactly what is the university experience?

Slow repetitive learning. Staying mentally focused on the boring. Making the boring attractive.

## Hyper Reactive 

It isn't about being lazy. Sports fanatics are not lazy. Amped up, hyperactive, but hyper re-active. When the players int he sports game move and shake, do something outragous, people react in crowds.

Connetators in sports are audience cheerleaders. Applause signs for the at-home audience.  Graphics and animation cue the audience.

Unplanned, shocking government actions give a sports media environment to the White House.

Sports fans are not lazy. They are fixated. Us vs. them is about being thrilled that othrs make bad choices and coaches give bad advice, the dramatic pressure of havig a huge audience and the clock going in only one direction. Everything is a countdown to the next level of competittion, the playoffs, the championship, the next season of the sport.

Elections have become countdowns like the world cup every 4 years. 

It is too boring to repeat the same topic every day of health care. But people repeat rich mensex games of Epstein over and over. People repeat "donnie dementia diapers" over and over. "Sleep Joe Biden" over andover (which means: boring Joe Biden, not thrilling antics like Trump and Fox News).

# This won't make front page

This post won't make the front page... but look at the comments. Just look at the reactionary shit-takes people have on these topics. Mental exploit words kick in reactions.

Unhinged from what? Unhinged from truth, reality, goodness.

This is rough draft raw even for me ;) I hope I can keep revisiting this topic, but it is very grim. Nobody wants to deal with this addiction to out-group hate in the Middle East.

**Harlan Ellison's Solution for Palestine and Israel**

2:07     
I am the senior editorial reporter for the Jerusalem Post and I would love to interview you. And I said just fire away. And the first out of his mouth is... what do you as an American Jew think of the situation in the Middle East? And I said to him: well, why would you ask me that... I'm a writer... I write amusing little fantasies. I'm a professional liar, I'm not a political commentator. I don't know what your people are going through over there. I have no comment...

2:30    
... I have no opinion. no no, he says, we're anxious to hear what you think. And he nudges and nudges and pushes at me already. I know I'm going to hate Israel and he keeps saying I want to know what you think. We want to know what you want. And he sounds like Jackie Mason. So I say: listen, trust me, you don't want my opinion yeah. He screams: we want your opinion! we're dying for your opinion! we're pling to have your opinion! He goes on and on and on he will not let me off the hook.

So finally I reach the pimel line and I say okay... but remember the old Chinese adage be careful what you wish for because you might get it. And he goes: "haaha, extremely clever! So what is your opinion?" And I said... here's my opinion:

**All of you guys out there in the Middle East are out of the same Melting Pot. And you're all as crazy as a butterfly on absenth**. I don't know whether you're all Canaanites at the base or you're all Jews at the base or out of the land of Nod or whatever the hell you were at the get go. Semites or whatnot, but **you've been fighting there now for something like 8,000 years. And you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and peace. You're forever killing each other and sticking knives at each other and burning babies and the world has had to suffer with this.**

Great things have come out of the Middle East. Great things like the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity seems to be your chief export. Stupidity and violence are your cash crops all you. And this was before September 11th and I said my solution to the problem in the Middle East is this:

We erect a wall 26 mile high around the entire Middle East about 14 mile deep... that's Syria Lebanon Saudi Arabia Iraq Iran Israel Egypt... all of you, the whole bunch of you. 26 mile high with one door. Like a regular door in the front of a house. And every 10 years we will open the door and look inside. If you're still fighting... we close the door.

4:25    
And as we say in yish loen gain let be you should live and be well go and fight and kill yourselves and no one will interfere. But if we peek inside and it's safe, if it's nice and it's comfy and there's flowers growing... if you're not fighting and you got peace and quiet you can come out and play with the rest of us like human people.

And the guy says: "what?", and I said: "do you want me to repeat that?" and he says "no thank you very much". Bam, he hangs up on me. Within an hour USIA calls up and says: tour is off.

4:54   
And I tell you I was relieved. Being a tough Jew is like being a tough Oriental kid kid in an all black
neighborhood. It's like being an Irish kid in a Latino neighborhood. When you're an outsider, you got two choices: you either become a target for people to hit you to bully you and con you... to take advantage of you... and you wind up marrying people you shouldn't... and you wind up in a job you shouldn't have with people who bully you... or you get tough.

5:15   
Now tough doesn't mean hard. I'm not a hard guy. I'm a tough guy. That means that I take no and I'm wrong more often than I'm right and when I am I admit it. And that's another part of being a tough guy... when you're in the wrong you got to face up to it and you've got to take responsibility for it. You can't keep pushing it off with alibis on other people and you can never blame the fact that you are a Jew you can't play that card. That's what gets the goyam pissed at us.

We just had a little fender bender up here in the mountain where I live and I'm talking to the woman at triple A ("AAA" - American Automobile Association) and she starts talking about *you people*. She was a black woman so she probably didn't know she was actually quoting the evil bogus thoughts and philosophies of the protocolcalls of the Elders of Zion. But that's what she was doing. I tried to straighten her out but it was impossible it's widespread common lore that Jews own everything. To which my response is well if there is actually a great
International Jewish money conspiracy there's some Jew out there with two vshares because I'm working my ass off. Ah, you got to be able to accept responsibility for what you do and you've got to be able to try and convince a lot of people who aren't bad people... they're just ignorant. that's stupid just ignorant big difference that.

Jews are not the Arrogant all-knowing chosen people. That is as elitist as the Christians who think that when the Rapture comes they're going up and we're going down. That's just elitism and it's a bad kind of elitism as opposed to my elitism... which is based on intelligence which is a good elitism.

And if you don't like it... I'll punch the shit out of you!

### cracking under USA society pressure, year 2025

Cracking under the pressure. The USA is a pressure cooker of hate. Out-group hate.

The hate of Canadians in 2025 is so blatent, so obvious, it's outright domestic abuse behavior. It is drug abuse and food abuse behavior on a national scale. It's playing games with a weapon like playing with a gun in the house because guns are cool. It is so obvious sickening behavior to attack Canada like Trump and MAGA started doing in year 2025. Predatory agressive behavior. Egomania nation, USA.
