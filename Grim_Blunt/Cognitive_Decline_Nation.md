# Decline of mindsets 

Reactionary mindset, conditioned training to be reactive.

Exactly what is the university experience?

Slow repetitive learning. Staying mentally focused on the boring. Making the boring attractive.

## Hyper Reactive 

It isn't about being lazy. Sports fanatics are not lazy. Amped up, hyperactive, but hyper re-active. When the players int he sports game move and shake, do something outragous, people react in crowds.

Connetators in sports are audience cheerleaders. Applause signs for the at-home audience.  Graphics and animation cue the audience.

Unplanned, shocking government actions give a sports media environment to the White House.

Sports fans are not lazy. They are fixated. Us vs. them is about being thrilled that othrs make bad choices and coaches give bad advice, the dramatic pressure of havig a huge audience and the clock going in only one direction. Everything is a countdown to the next level of competittion, the playoffs, the championship, the next season of the sport.

Elections have become countdowns like the world cup every 4 years. 

It is too boring to repeat the same topic every day of health care. But people repeat rich mensex games of Epstein over and over. People repeat "donnie dementia diapers" over and over. "Sleep Joe Biden" over andover (which means: boring Joe Biden, not thrilling antics like Trump and Fox News).

# This won't make front page

This post won't make the front page... but look at the comments. Just look at the reactionary shit-takes people have on these topics. Mental exploit words kick in reactions.

Unhinged from what? Unhinged from truth, reality, goodness.

This is rough draft raw even for me ;) I hope I can keep revisiting this topic, but it is very grim. Nobody wants to deal with this addiction to out-group hate in the Middle East. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6gtHQGbXmM

opinion no no he says we're anxious to
hear what you think and he nudges and
nudges and pushes at me already. I know
I'm going to hate Israel and he keeps
saying I want to know what you think we
want to know what you want and he sounds
like Jackie Mason. So I say listen trust
me you don't want my opinion yeah he
screams we want your opinion we're dying
for your opinion we're pling to have
your opinion he goes on and on and on he
will not let me off the hook

so finally
I reach the pimel line and I say okay
but remember the old Chinese adage be
careful what you wish for because you
might get it and he goes haaha extremely
clever so what is your opinion and I
said here's my opinion

all of you guys
out there in the Middle East are out of
the same Melting Pot and you're all as
crazy as a butterfly on absenth I don't
know whether you're all Canaanites at
the base or you're all Jews at the base
or out of the land of Nod or whatever the
hell you were at the get go semites or
whatnot but you've been fighting there
now for something like 8,000 years and
you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and
peace. you're forever killing each other
and sticking knives at each other and
burning babies and the world has had to
suffer with this.

Great things have come
out of the Middle East. Great things like
the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity
seems to be your chief export. Stupidity
and violence are your cash crops all you
and this was before September 11th and I
said my solution to the problem in the
Middle East
is this we erect a wall 26 mil high
around the entire Middle East about 14
mil deep that's Syria Lebanon Saudi
Arabia Iraq Iran Israel Egypt all of you
the whole bunch of you. 26 mile high with
one door like a regular door in the
front of a house and every 10 years we
will open the door and look inside if
you're still fighting we close the door.

4:25    
and as we say in yish loen gain let be
you should live and be well go and fight
and kill yourselves and no one will
interfere but if we peek inside and it's
safe if it's nice and it's comfy and
there's flowers growing if you're not
fighting and you got peace and quiet you
can come out and play with the rest of
us like human people and the guy says
what and I said do you want me to repeat
that and he says no thank you very much
bam he hangs up on me within an hour an
hour USIA calls up and says tours off.

4:54   
and I tell you I was relieved being a
tough Jew is like being a tough
Oriental kid kid in an all black
neighborhood. it's like being an Irish
kid in a Latino neighborhood when you're
an outsider you got two choices you
either become a target for people to hit
you to bully you and con you to take
advantage of you and you wind up
marrying people you shouldn't and you
wind up in a job you shouldn't have with
people who bully you or you get tough.

now tough doesn't mean hard I'm not a
5:20
hard guy I'm a tough guy that means that
5:23
I take no and I'm wrong more often
5:25
than I'm right and when I am I admit it
5:29
and that's another part of being a tough
5:30
guy when you're in the wrong you got to
5:32
face up to it and you've got to take
5:33
responsibility for it you can't keep
5:36
pushing it off with alibis on other
5:37
people and you can never blame the fact
5:39
that you are a Jew you can't play that
5:41
card that's what gets the goyam pissed
5:43
atat us we just had a little fender
5:45
bender up here in the mountain where I
5:47
live and I'm talking to the woman at
5:48
tripa a and she starts talking about you
5:51
people she was a black woman so she
5:53
probably didn't know she was actually
5:55
quoting the evil bogus thoughts and
5:57
philosophies of the protocol
5:59
calls of the Elders of Zion but that's
6:02
what she was doing I tried to straighten
6:04
her out but it was impossible it's
6:06
widespread common lore that Jews own
6:09
everything to which my response is well
6:11
if there is actually a great
6:12
International Jewish money conspiracy
6:14
there's some Jew out there with two
6:15
shares because I'm working my ass
6:18
off ah you got to be able to accept
6:21
responsibility for what you
6:23
do and you've got to be able to try and
6:25
convince a lot of people who aren't bad
6:27
people they're just ignorant that's
6:29
stupid just ignorant big difference that
6:32
Jews are not the Arrogant all- knowing
6:34
chosen people that is as elitist
6:36
as the Christians who think
6:38
that when the Rapture comes they're
6:39
going up and we're going down that's
6:42
just elitism and it's a bad kind of
6:44
elitism as opposed to my elitism which
6:47
is based on intelligence which is a good
6:49
elitism and if you don't like it I'll
6:51
punch the out of you

Cracking under the pressure. The USA is a pressure cooker of hate. Out-group hate.

The hate of Canadians in 2025 is so blatent, so obvious, it's outright domestic abuse behavior. It is drug abuse and food abuse behavior on a national scale. It's playing games with a weapon like playing with a gun in the house because guns are cool. It is so obvious sickening behavior to attack Canada like Trump and MAGA opened 2025. Predatory agressive behavior. Egomania nation, USA.
