# Decline of mindsets 

Reactionary mindset, conditioned training to be reactive.

2. Carl Sagan
3. David Foster Wallace

Exactly what is the university experience?

Slow repetitive learning. Staying mentally focused on the boring. Making the boring attractive.

## Hyper Reactive 

It isn't about being lazy. Sports fanatics are not lazy. Amped up, hyperactive, but hyper re-active. When the players int he sports game move and shake, do something outrageous, people react in crowds.

Commentators in sports settings are audience cheerleaders. Applause signs for the at-home audience.  Graphics and animation cue the audience.

Unplanned, shocking government actions give a sports media environment to the White House.

Sports fans are not lazy. They are fixated. Us vs. them is about being thrilled that others make bad choices and coaches give bad advice, the dramatic pressure of having a huge audience and the clock going in only one direction. Everything is a countdown to the next level of competition, the playoffs, the championship, the next season of the sport.

Elections have become countdowns like the world cup every 4 years. 

It is too boring to repeat the same topic every day of health care. But people repeat rich men sex games of Epstein over and over. People repeat "donnie dementia diapers" over and over. "Sleep Joe Biden" over and over (which means: boring Joe Biden, not thrilling antics like Trump and Fox News).

# Harlan Ellison, Middle East 8000 years

This is rough draft raw even for me ;) I hope I can keep revisiting this topic, but it is very grim. Nobody wants to deal with this addiction to out-group hate in the Middle East. 

Automated YouTube transcript, so not formatted and may have some errors. Audio in link.

**Harlan Ellison's Solution for Palestine and Israel**

2:07     
I am the senior editorial reporter for the Jerusalem Post and I would love to interview you. And I said just fire away. And the first out of his mouth is... what do you as an American Jew think of the situation in the Middle East? And I said to him: well, why would you ask me that... I'm a writer... I write amusing little fantasies. I'm a professional liar, I'm not a political commentator. I don't know what your people are going through over there. I have no comment...

2:30    
... I have no opinion. no no, he says, we're anxious to hear what you think. And he nudges and nudges and pushes at me already. I know I'm going to hate Israel and he keeps saying I want to know what you think. We want to know what you want. And he sounds like Jackie Mason. So I say: listen, trust me, you don't want my opinion yeah. He screams: we want your opinion! we're dying for your opinion! we're pling to have your opinion! He goes on and on and on he will not let me off the hook.

So finally I reach the pimel line and I say okay... but remember the old Chinese adage be careful what you wish for because you might get it. And he goes: "haaha, extremely clever! So what is your opinion?" And I said... here's my opinion:

**All of you guys out there in the Middle East are out of the same Melting Pot. And you're all as crazy as a butterfly on absenth**. I don't know whether you're all Canaanites at the base or you're all Jews at the base or out of the land of Nod or whatever the hell you were at the get go. Semites or whatnot, but **you've been fighting there now for something like 8,000 years. And you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and peace. You're forever killing each other and sticking knives at each other and burning babies and the world has had to suffer with this.**

Great things have come out of the Middle East. Great things like the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity seems to be your chief export. Stupidity and violence are your cash crops all you. And **this was before September 11th** and I said my solution to the problem in the Middle East is this:

We erect a wall 26 mile high around the entire Middle East about 14 mile deep... that's Syria Lebanon Saudi Arabia Iraq Iran Israel Egypt... all of you, the whole bunch of you. 26 mile high with one door. Like a regular door in the front of a house. And every 10 years we will open the door and look inside. If you're still fighting... we close the door.

4:25    
And as we say in yish loen gain let be you should live and be well go and fight and kill yourselves and no one will interfere. But if we peek inside and it's safe, if it's nice and it's comfy and there's flowers growing... if you're not fighting and you got peace and quiet you can come out and play with the rest of us like human people.

And the guy says: "what?", and I said: "do you want me to repeat that?" and he says "no thank you very much". Bam, he hangs up on me. Within an hour USIA calls up and says: tour is off.

4:54   
And I tell you I was relieved. Being a tough Jew is like being a tough Oriental kid in an all black
neighborhood. It's like being an Irish kid in a Latino neighborhood. When you're an outsider, you got two choices: you either become a target for people to hit you to bully you and con you... to take advantage of you... and you wind up marrying people you shouldn't... and you wind up in a job you shouldn't have with people who bully you... or you get tough.

5:15   
Now tough doesn't mean hard. I'm not a hard guy. I'm a tough guy. That means that I take no and I'm wrong more often than I'm right and when I am I admit it. And that's another part of being a tough guy... when you're in the wrong you got to face up to it and you've got to take responsibility for it. You can't keep pushing it off with alibis on other people and you can never blame the fact that you are a Jew you can't play that card. That's what gets the goyam pissed at us.

We just had a little fender bender up here in the mountain where I live and I'm talking to the woman at triple A ("AAA" - American Automobile Association) and she starts talking about *you people*. She was a black woman so she probably didn't know she was actually quoting the evil bogus thoughts and philosophies of the protocolcalls of the Elders of Zion. But that's what she was doing. I tried to straighten her out but it was impossible it's widespread common lore that Jews own everything. To which my response is well if there is actually a great International Jewish money conspiracy there's some Jew out there with two vshares because I'm working my ass off. Ah, you got to be able to accept responsibility for what you do and you've got to be able to try and convince a lot of people who aren't bad people... they're just ignorant. that's stupid just ignorant big difference that.

Jews are not the Arrogant all-knowing chosen people. That is as elitist as the Christians who think that when the Rapture comes they're going up and we're going down. That's just elitism and it's a bad kind of elitism as opposed to my elitism... which is based on intelligence which is a good elitism.

And if you don't like it... I'll punch the shit out of you!

### What do I get from that Harlan Ellison audio?

I get what I (Stephen Gutknecht/ RoundSparrow) get from my birthspace state of Georgia USA. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. February 28, 1954:

"**There is something wrong with our world, something fundamentally and basically wrong. I don't think we have to look too far to see that**. I'm sure that most of you would agree with me in making that assertion. And when we stop to analyze the cause of our world's ills, many things come to mind. We begin to wonder if it is due to the fact that we don't know enough. But it can't be that. Because in terms of accumulated knowledge we know more today than men have known in any period of human history. We have the facts at our disposal. We know more about mathematics, about science, about social science, and philosophy than we've ever known in any period of the world's history. So it can't be because we don't know enough. And then we wonder if it is due to the fact that our scientific genius lags behind. That is, if we have not made enough progress scientifically. Well then, it can't be that. For our scientific progress over the past years has been amazing. Man through his scientific genius has been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains, so that today it's possible to eat breakfast in New York City and supper in London, England. Back in about 1753 it took a letter three days to go from New York City to Washington, and today you can go from here to China in less time than that. It can't be because man is stagnant in his scientific progress. Man's scientific genius has been amazing. I think we have to look much deeper than that if we are to find the real cause of man's problems and the real cause of the world's ills today. If we are to really find it I think we will have to look in the hearts and souls of men."

&nbsp;

Harlan Ellison's audio echos to me Nina Paley's animated music video about the Middle East too... "Thsi Land Is Mine"... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tIdCsMufIY

&nbsp;

What I see in USA society, and experienced in North Africa living... is a kind of admiration of the Middle East ideas but a failure to be sincere about how terrible the outcomes are. That the education system of the clergy is terrible.

Joseph Campbell at age 83 said that the 3 major Levant religions had disqualified themselves from the future in year 1987. Which echos what Harlan Ellison is saying (not sure when, but he metions after September 2001, and obviously still agrees with it then).

1. Malala in Pakistan
2. Martin Luther King Jr in Atlanta, Georgia
3. Joseph Campbell USA
4. Harlan Ellison
5. Nina Paley "This Land Is Mine" ideas

It is as if we all recognize that the GROUP behavior, the society behaivor, the mob mentality thinking of crowds of people is all wrong. Things that people are likely willing to criticize in public about a family, a marriage... are openly tolerated and people even seem blind to them. As Harlan Ellison emphasizes this has been going on for something like 8,000 years! And he died BEFORE October 7, 2023 Palestine terrorism murdering of people in Israel and the overkill military response of the IDF.

USA holds THe Bible in such high esteem. Atheists are reactionary to the Bible, and nobody in USA discusses the Great Seal of the United States of America from the Founding Fathers - which addresses, at heart, everything Donald Trump and MAGA poison. Non-instrumental reason thinking! Which is what I see with the 5 names listed... what I see with Harlan Ellison is being *woke to media ecology*. Harlan Ellison clearly has not lived 8,000 years to witness the Middle East, he has learned this from writings and history. James Joyce is saying "History is a Nightmare", this is what it means to me. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's quote above, Harlan Ellison attitude about the 8,000 year history of the Middle East...

### cracking under USA society pressure, year 2025

Cracking under the pressure. The USA is a pressure cooker of hate. Out-group hate.

The hate of Canadians in 2025 is so blatent, so obvious, it's outright domestic abuse behavior. It is drug abuse and food abuse behavior on a national scale. It's playing games with a weapon like playing with a gun in the house because guns are cool. It is so obvious sickening behavior to attack Canada like Trump and MAGA started doing in year 2025. Predatory agressive behavior. Egomania nation, USA.

### How her audience reacts

The first few minutes how she points out the abusive responses from audience.   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8sfMiQrBFg

"This episode is not about taking sides — not between science and spirituality, not between reason and faith, not between left and right. It is about stepping beyond the war of opinions, into the deeper space of human resonance.

In a world increasingly torn by ideological battles, political shouting matches, and binary thinking, we’ve forgotten how to simply listen. This episode is an invitation to remember — to see how the desire to “win” has become the hidden engine of division and suffering. When we fight to be right, we stop seeking to understand. When we silence the other, we lose ourselves."

&nbsp;

Exactly! Comprehension takes time, reactionary outcomes since the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica of March 2013 onward. People do not comprehend complex ideas before reacting to them. There is no more pondering, the race of social media reaction / Donald Trump interactive audience Tony Clifton reaction interaction...

### Low-effort media content

High effort on "fititng in" with latest style, fashion, graphics, production values / audience values of style. But low-effort on the ideas, thiking.

Thinking becomes more and more difficult when Fox News / CNN saturate the people around you. You can't condense ideas into sound-bites. Teacher / Edicator / TV show creator Carl Sagan said this in 1995, and it is the basis of Neil Postman's 1985 book.

With people around you react-commenting and consuming reaction images and comments on every media platform, thinking becomes more and more difficult because there is a breakdown of language.

Just as declared in Newsweek headline February 12, 2019 - "The illusion of choice is the most important illusion, the main trick of Western democracy especially…. The rejection of this illusion in favor of the reality that everything is predestined will allow society to reflect first on our vision of democratic development," Surkov wrote. "Foreign politicians talk about Russia's interference in elections and referendums around the world. In fact, the matter is even more serious: **Russia interferes in your brains, we change your conscience**, and there is nothing you can do about it."

Working together... [Trump, Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency mind-fucked](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446) every person who uses social media or talks to people (second hand smoke influence) who use social media since March 2013 ramp-up of the IRA. A primary symptom of the Kremlin mind fucking outcomes is people being unwilling to discuss facts and details of players (Surkov, Putin, etc), dates, names of organizations, reported by multiple NATO nations, etc.  Ukraine is the most on top of it, USA is mind-fucked into avoidance of the topic (and avoidance of Neil Postman, now dead author, 1985 book).

Americans have not defended, no sense of civic duty, nobody is taking seriously that measles is still spreading in North America (Texas, Canada, etc) from mind-fucked people that Russia has attacked since year 2014 on Twitter and other media platforms: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

### Subconscious exploit, brain MonoMyth

&nbsp;

October 17, 2025 "Cognitive Decline" headline

Why do people obey orders that make non sense? Obedience to a Male Father Figure is exactly the talent Trump has mastered. His sexual acts with family and women are all about that "Super Man" image. Yet, Social Media Society can't stand up to it. Mocking Trump for his domination is a form of worship. Allah / Yahweh / God is not a nice guy in Levant tradition. This is a brain exploit for thousands of years in the Levant, a nasty mean father figure.

"It seems to me that young Douglas is going to go to his mum and dad, and they’ll talk to him about it and explain how it fits and so on, and then will come that shattering night when you are about sixteen, and you find out mum and dad are afraid to die too… or maybe fourteen. And on a Freudian account, it’s not accidental that that’s the time you reach out for large and invisible fathers to protect you… and mothers. And you know what, that’s elegant suspicion. It is not an argument; it’s an elegant suspicion.

In fact when you look at the iconic significance of churches, you know the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, the family values stuff, you know… I mean, I hate to sound cynical, but as Freud says, they whole thing is so patently infantile. So obviously infantile, that to anyone with the love of humanity it’s just sad to think that most people will never rise above this view of life. Well, when you have had a snotty German talk to you that way, you begin to suspect that he may be right, and this is one of the masters of suspicion." - Texan Rick Roderick, 1993, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/
