# Lies Confusion Comprehension Understanding

&nbsp;

Humans can not distinguish misunderstandings from lies. It is a global problem throughout history.

And it is a mistake when we accept lies and manipulation, trick each other, because we are barely getting by with our grasp on truth and reality *without* manipulation. That's the point of Neil Postman and television. "I do not mean to imply that television news **deliberately aims** to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result." - 1985

It is not deliberate, that's the reason I keep pointing to Neil Postman. We are tricked and bamboozled by our shallow superficial reactions. We don't *need* someone trying to trick us, it happens because of the structure and venue.

# Deception, Self-Deception

Some ideas take hundreds of years and teams of thousands of people. Problems that were recognized but unsolved, such as germ theory. It wasn't until the invention of microscope technology that we started to better understand diseases that seemed invisible.

## Spy vs. Spy, Active Measures

There comes a time... July 31, 2025

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mekr09/clinton_plan_emails_were_likely_made_by_russian/

Where the Spy vs. Spy sloshing of bullshit and falsehoods wreckes anyone actually comprehending where it all started. The "Tower of Babel" Torah, Bible, Quran metaphor kicks in! Bullshit deception patterns of language communications start to create interference patterns and jam truth of the technique copycat methods.

Monomyth spirals into retcon monomyth, and nobody speaks the dead Latin Lanauge that Martin Luther in Germany translated to everyday people over 500 years ago. Get it?

It isn't fun. Putin isn't having fun, Trump isn't having fun, Israel isn't having fun, Sudan isn't having fun, Ukraine isn't having fun. None of you have convinced me you grasp compassion and love at the Joycean level of 1924 "on the same page" of world monomyth.

This bullshit, deception, lies, is just not enjoyable. Whatever you are feeling is not joy or fun. It is egomania and it is fun toxic like some drug that wrecks the drug addict.
