"Now simulation in this society didn’t just come from nowhere. This society of simulations and of spectacles. Baudrillard actually builds his work on a foundation again that comes out of the Marxist tradition. Guy Debord wrote a book in the sixties called “The Society of the Spectacle“. And what it was about, was about how when capitalism reached a certain level of accumulation, commodities began to detach themselves and become images. And citizens who formerly had played roles as political actors began to detach themselves from their own lives and become spectators."

# USA reaction-commenting social media

Reacting upvoting, react liking, react ReTweeting, reaction images, reaction memes, reaction comments, reaction fiction movie and TV lines. Oceans and oceans of shallow superficial reactions on every media platform.

> A general strike would be the first step

The *first step* is being intellectually serious and stop react-commenting to everything gong on with the wild and crazy antics politics of Donald Trump White House and MAGA. Deal with the brainrot head on and start teaching from people like  Eli Pariser... his book The Filter Bubble (2011),

That book has been rotting on the shelf since year 2011 while Americans refuse to face up to their egoism over media consumption and blocking out what they don't like to hear (just like Trump White House wants to block out immigrants and languages and media systems they don't comprehend). Confront these problems *head on* as a **civic duty** of peer to peer rescue.

Why is Jen Senko, the baby boomer who stood up, not a household name since March 2016 when her film went into wide release? 

Because social media users won't keep repeating what is serious and important about social media itself / Fox News media itself.

Reddit comments are filtered and silently removed. 

>  writing comments on reddit that won’t change anything?

Reddit comments could change everything if people would get on the same page and repeat authors instead of making reaction comments to every tree and recognize the entire forest.

1. Quote writings from  Peter Pomerantsev

2. Quote cult deprogramming books, the public library is full of them

3. Quote Christopher Wylie's two books from 2019 which are before Project 2025 was ever created, which are titled "Plot to break"

Stand up for actually rescuing ourselves from the intellectual warfare situation instead of taste-testing each Donald Trump and MAGA turd and grading the flavor of the shit.

Up till now advertising has been all good news and, therefore, gets very little attention.” -  [War and Peace in the Global Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village).

What Trump has been doing since 2016 is called "Bullshitting" in philosophy.    
The difference between lying and bullshitting is that the liar still cares about what is true, while the Bullshitter is indifferent about the truth.

The issue with Bullshitting is that it is an order of magnitude more difficult to disprove it than it is to create it.     
That is also why Trump and other conservative populists have been so successfull on social media.    
You can just push out BS and eventually something catches on and spreads through social media, people just upvote and share stuff because it represents something that fits their bias and any sort of actual counterarguement drowns in the endless stream of new BS.

"On top of that, besides being a member of a certain group, once removal of 'unwanted' individuals is normalized it can and will be used against absolutely EVERYONE for any reason. If you do or say the wrong thing or just have something someone higher in the hierarchy wants, you're gone. You're not going to be able to trust anyone under a totalitarian regime. Those that welcome authoritarianism never seem to be aware of this. It's a constantly stressful way of being for EVERYONE."
