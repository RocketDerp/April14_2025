# Monotheism / MonoMyth

Of course this is a mess of a document. Very raw, unedited, uncorrected.

"Now, today (1987) there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And **the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is **a problem that the world is going to have to face** — because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact." - Joseph Campbell, age 83, year 1987

Technology of being able to organize a virus or bacteria to spraed disease deliberately, knowledge to do so, biological terrorism or warfare. Some radical new physics development (discovery) that would allow targeted killing from remote distance.

## Common Ground 

The enjoyment of sports and competitition, winners, heroes.

Racial superiority, skin color superiority, education superiority, technology superiority, common understanding superiority, team behavior superiority, working together superiority, gender superiority (sports divide genders frequently).

Asset superioirty, land ownership superiority, stategic real estate location superiority.

Trademark, trade secret, certification of skill, superior validation and testing that a device or ingredient is pure / without flaws (such as aircraft repair and maintenace parts validation, supply chain to avoid tampering / fraud).

# Monotheism

One god or manny gods, one agreement.

I sometimes view Islam as a revision of Christianity from the perspective that prayer was taken to structure and routine. Like adding automatic routine oil changes for a internal combustion gasoline mechanical car engine. Or routine m aintenace on an aircraft engine.

["Salat times are prayer times when Muslims perform salat. The term is primarily used for the five daily prayers including the Friday prayer, which takes the place of the Dhuhr prayer and must be performed in a group."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah_times)

Look at areas in human life where routine and timing come up: summer time off work, summer time off schools, weekend weddings and parties and camping trips and nightclubs and movie premiers, but then you can also see offset: were home movie releases and vido game releases in North America often on Tuesday intentionally not to compete with weekends?

Live music band concerts by many famous bands in 1960 to 2019 were not fixted in one location, and often subject to travel complications (cancelations of shows), sickness (travel may expose one to more illness from food or person to person, or injury), venue restrictions (not allowing fireworks, too large or too small to accomodate a theater-like performance such as Styx Mr. Roboto opera)

Did adding routine prayer work? Did it prevent things.

[Debate on 3 prayers a day or 5, etc](https://www.medinaminds.com/sunni-prayer-vs-shia-prayer/)

My blunt stance is that personal biology comes into play. At age 16 hormones of a boy may drive needs for medication (prayer) self-reflection that the same person at age 28 may find different. Probably better example than tht.

Alas, some of it is driven by structure. If someone's job (profession, "making a living") is being an air pilot for trips across the oceans that take 9 hours and such, and they work long days for 4 days a week and have 3 days off, their prayer needs may be very different base on being in a busy city or more relxed setting on their days off work. Are they a preent raising children? Are they building a house that takes 1 or 2 years?

If everyone is at a sports stadium or a live music concert or a cinema / movie theater or live theatrical play - there are routines on start time, end time (exiting, transportation home), and even toilet usage schedules.

Did organized prayer (meditation) make for better people? Did it refresh the programming of that one specific religion - making it harder for people to peer with people from other religions? Is it like repeating your native langauge lesosns to make sure you aren't making common grammar and syntax mistakes on a daily basis for 30 minutes, or like a police officer who has to clean their weapon and go to the firing range to practice their aim? (of course, maybe better examples) - do cooks who work professionally 5 days a week full time have to take refresher courses on food safety and nutrition if they are also the menu planner?

I do see a major problem with book supremacy. Torah, Bible, Quran - and claiming that out of the entire world public library of all books (stories, oral or writen) that ONLY one story is perfect and all other science fiction stories are imperfect / wrong.

In my 55 years alive and world travels, I agree with Joseph Campbell at age 83: 

1. "That’s the reduction of mythology to theology. Mythology is very fluid. Most of the myths are self-contradictory. You may even find four or five myths in a given culture, all giving different versions of the same mystery. Then theology comes along and says it has got to be just this way. Mythology is poetry, and the poetic language is very flexible. Religion turns poetry into prose. God is literally up there, and this is literally what he thinks, and this is the way you’ve got to behave to get into proper relationship with that god up there."
2. "ou have to break past your image of God to get through to the connoted illumination. The psychologist Jung has a relevant saying: “Religion is a defense against the experience of God.” The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience."
