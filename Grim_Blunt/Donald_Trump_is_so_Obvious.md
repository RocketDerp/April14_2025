# That's the Point: Donald Trump is so obvious

&nbsp;

Badness itself is in the audience, unpopularity is popular.

The obviousness of Donald Trump is the problem, it is an audience problem, it is a Tony Clifton performance, but it is reality itself - not just entertainment.

[Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack 1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGkyFs_SkIk) monomyth media patterns, it is *that obvious*. That's my core point. That is why I telephoned the Pentagon Monday, August 17, 2015 afternoon. We are talking [9 to 5 with Dolly Parton, and Donald Trump playing Franklin Hart Jr. from year 1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqwmyq9XGVU) monomyth story patterns, Mr. Montgomery Burns himself!

&nbsp;

I knew we were dealing with bit-flipping in the mind of core values. I did not know August 17, 2015 about Cambridge Anlyatica, I didn't know about the Internet Research Agency, but I recognized the persistent patterns of monomyth mind-fuck on Reddit social media comments that had not gone away. People avoidant of rich complex understanding in favor of hyper banality as described by Rick Roderick in 1993.People ere *attracted to* the antics of MAGA / Trump and people [did not see the flocking reactions to Donald J. Trump as a threat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M).

&nbsp;

it is BECAUSE Donald Trump was so obviously bad, badness itself being sleeked out by people in interpretations of complex ideas, that I knew this was huge.

“In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.”
