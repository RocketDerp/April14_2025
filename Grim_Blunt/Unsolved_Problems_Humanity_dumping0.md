## Unsolved Problems of Humanity

Dumping ground of messages and ideas that I can't finish or solve either. But my mind is stuck with [hyper empathy](https://www.shu.ac.uk/news/all-articles/latest-news/autism-and-hyper-empathy-study) and I don't know the future, maybe in weeks or months I can rewrite this.

People view nations as a competition instead of viewing:

1. all war bad
2. all terrorism bad
3. all hate bad ( ["The 1954 Equation"](../Quotes_Pile/Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) )
4. every person in the world has a body and medical progress are common
5. medical drugs, medical techniques, medical instruction and education, medical technology are common (because our human body is common)
6. food and shelter common
7. long-term understandings of cancer, virus, and disease are common. Such as allergies, enviornmental toxins, pollution, stress, food / dietary, exercise, sleep, etc.
8. lies, manipulation, poisoning, murder, traps, tricks, deceptive signs and signals in enviornment, kidnapping, imprisoning are bad no matter what nation, religion, geography. common.
9. public relations, propaganda, advertising, marketing, product placement, insincere recommendations motivated by earning money... all have side-effects and impact in negative ways. Manipulation and trust being exploited.

Donald Trump life is about private jets, security guards, lavish bling bling symbolism of wealth.  Telling lies and manipulation to trick people out of their labor, wealth and goodness so clever selfish people can have more land and wealth and rule over others in egomania. The biggest egoism politician who can lie better to the audiences is who is winning (and those with egomania who understand lies / mannipulation / falsehoods / deception who support and desire such politicians as their representatives). People who have not been educated to comprehend crowd behavior manipulation methods (information warfare, etc) are gullible and trusting of liars instead of openly and actively teaching the problem of #egomania that Donald Trump / Rupert Murdoch have.

I see highly educated social media users who don't want to support #MalalaYousafzai because she wants stable and high quality education for more people. And Donald Trump values are that education is a competition of telling lies and falsehoods to other people, not about equal comprehending and understanding ... instead wanting to see wars, see diseased people, see people tricked into self-harm ( The very popular year 2025 "Leopards Ate my Face" mocking of the uneducated and misunderstanding #MAGA voters, for example)

And that is how social media users have behaved since October 8, 2013 when Malala Yousafzai's book was published. Educated people with computer systems on social media don't want to end hate and end war and have ALL people educated and understanding how politicians use lies and falsehoods, because everything is a competitive "sports mentality' of wanting others to be uneducated, starving, manipulated by their leaders so that there are "winners" in the sports of life.

The whole human race, over 8 billion people alive today, is not winning this game that social media users play against Malala Yousafzai's book / ideas / observations. Ignorance and lack of comprehensive education, with authentic understanding and comprehension, is a drag on the whole planet. Russia's war against Ukraine is a drag on the whole planet, gong on since February 2014 - and social media users think it is a waste of time to lecture Russian people and politicians that hate, war, dehumanization, greed, lies, falsehoods are all bad. They ARE all bad, but people are competing in sports mentality that it is somehow good that #Russia believes bad lies and kills people in offensive conquest. It isn't good, it is bad.

## MAGA USA movement

&nbsp;

https://autistics.life/@RoundSparrow/114919207556423747

1. #MAGA understandings and comprehensions are bad. Bad is bad. There is no winning in USA that people believe liars, falsehoods, clever mob mentality manipulators.

2. Social media users show every day that they are thrilled MAGA is failures to insult and mock.

3. Entire USA sinking into bullshit, falsehoods

4. A dramatic change in values started in year 2013 in USA society. People now prize hate and prize dehumanization. People prize egoism.

5. Many people living in psychological denial of the situaiton of July 2025 will claim: we had bullshit in year 1982, we had liars in year 1973, we had this in 1840. What changed is the Apple iPhone / smartphone / 4G mobile / 5G mobile and people's behaviors of machine lust, dehumanization. Speed of reactionary thinking, short-length Twitter messages. Books abandoned.

6. Next, people will claim "we haven't abandoned books since year 2013" - without recognizing that #copyright laws are eating humanity alive. What people do, to avoid copyright #infringement and to earn profit, is publish new books. But these books largely say many things older and not profitable books already said... in a worse way. Put another way: instead of a Wikipedia style system of full edit history and refinement of ideas, we have ChatGPT and other generative AI systems creating unique words to avoid copyright infringement and create profit for newly created works.  Neil Postman's [1985](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2337731-amusing-ourselves-to-death-public-discourse-in-the-age-of-show-business) book, [1992](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1511641-technopoly-the-surrender-of-culture-to-technology) book, and [1995](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/508006-the-end-of-education-redefining-the-value-of-school) books are important comprehension on these topics. We keep reinventing wheels, often rubbish wheel designs, to have cash flow for authors and egoism for authors... many good ideas and expressions are locked up in copyright or considered "boring" to Twitter meme-addicted society.

# Some Progressive Ideas

Some ideas on action July 30, 2025    
California pushes back campaign   

1. The Democratic political party make a licensing deal with Enter Shikari and start posting on every Democrat and Governor / Senator / Congressperson social media accounts the songs every 36 hours for the next 12 months. Clips, lyrics quotes, time-indexed link into the YouTube videos with lyric entry points, visual meme images with quotes, reaction videos. Not just the songs and song videos, but also there is ["Enter Shikari have released the first in a mini-series"](https://www.entershikari.com/posts/a-film-on-possibility?srsltid=AfmBOooZ1m6A85a8F7b4XVNwel8MXHe9LSipmTxNkbbaCHNmLip0dhdZ) and a book to quote. Emphasize the UK saving American like America saved France and Germany.

2. Andrew Postman spoke up in February 2017 in public. Can you license the 184 page book from 1985, "Amusing Ourselves To Death" or bend fair use as best you can, and quote that book until EVERY PERSON age 12 to 120 is on the same page. California / Hollywood / **HOLLYWOOD has something to say about media and medium** campaign.

3. "Who is Peter Pomerantsev?", "What did Pomerantsev write in 2014?" messages, seed it. Package two dollar bills, $2, [paperclipped on an index-card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_card) with cool collectible artwork on them, and spend $131,313 (65656 [$2 bills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDw_YqRaRkU) bundled with collectable index card) handing them out in California cities and Portland Oregon and Seattle. Maybe network with local internet streamers of radio stations for handout events. Make Peter Pomerantsev Russian born, London raised, a household name. "What Did Adam Curtis say New Years Eve 2014 on BBC?"

4. "We Made a Mistake in year 2020" media campaign (August 2025 onward message campaign). "We made an error in 2020".  ... *we*, the *we the society, people*, and *we the Democrats*, and *we the social media*... .... mistakes / errors / were not thinking .... .... [On June 1, 2020 Donald Trump posed with The Bible in front of a Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church) --- **THE MISTAKE WE MADE** was not paying for media messages to teach / preach Bible verse Matthew 6:5 all of June 2 to June 30, all of August, September, October, up to the November 2020 election. Matthew 6:5 is not that much to learn, active teaching of Matthew 6:5 literacy to everyone in society age 12 to age 120. See also verse "1 John 3:17", which is 1,800 years before Karl Marx.
