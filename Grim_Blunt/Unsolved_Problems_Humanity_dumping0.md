## Unsolved Problems of Humanity

Dumping ground of messages and ideas that I can't finish or solve either. But my mind is stuck with [hyper empathy](https://www.shu.ac.uk/news/all-articles/latest-news/autism-and-hyper-empathy-study) and I don't know the future, maybe in weeks or months I can rewrite this.

People view nations as a competition instead of viewing:

1. all war bad
2. all terrorism bad
3. all hate bad ( ["The 1954 Equation"](../Quotes_Pile/Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) )
4. every person in the world has a body and medical techniques are common
5. food and shelter common
6. lies, manipulation, poisoning, murder, traps, kidnapping, imprisoning are bad no matter what nation, what religion, every geography

Donald Trump life is about private jets, security guards, lavish bling bling symbolism of wealth.  Telling lies and manipulation to trick people out of their labor, wealth and goodness so clever selfish people can have more land and wealth and rule over others. The biggest politician who can lie better to the audiences is who is winning. People are gullible and trusting of liars instead of teaching the problem of #egomania that Donald Trump / Rupert Murdoch have.

I see highly educated social media users who don't want to support #MalalaYousafzai because she wants stable and high quality education for more people. And Donald Trump values are that education is a competition of telling lies and falsehoods to other people, not about equal comprehending and understanding ... instead wanting to see wars, see diseased people, see people tricked into self-harm ( The very popular year 2025 "Leopards Ate my Face" mocking of the uneducated and misunderstanding #MAGA voters, for example)

And that is how social media users have behaved since October 8, 2013 when Malala Yousafzai's book was published. Educated people with computer systems on social media don't want to end hate and end war and have ALL people educated and understanding how politicians use lies and falsehoods, because everything is a competitive "sports mentality' of wanting others to be uneducated, starving, manipulated by their leaders so that there are "winners" in the sports of life.

The whole human race, over 8 billion people alive today, is not winning this game that social media users play against Malala Yousafzai's book / ideas / observations. Ignorance and lack of comprehensive education, with authentic understanding and comprehension, is a drag on the whole planet. Russia's war against Ukraine is a drag on the whole planet, gong on since February 2014 - and social media users think it is a waste of time to lecture Russian people and politicians that hate, war, dehumanization, greed, lies, falsehoods are all bad. They ARE all bad, but people are competing in sports mentality that it is somehow good that #Russia believes bad lies and kills people in offensive conquest. It isn't good, it is bad.
