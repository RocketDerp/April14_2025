# What Changed: We Stopped Teaching NonFiction to Adults

iPhone Society    
Since middle of year 2007, the Apple iPhone   
The Apple iPad   
The Android devices   

That is what changed. Adult education shifted from Fox News Cable TV, HDTV, over to smartphones / tablets. Internet devices. Meme devices. Memes.

People became addicted to fiction memes, streaming fiction content, fiction and more fiction.

* "For all the ways one can define **fascism** (and there are many), one essential trait is its allegiance to no idea of right but its own: it is, in short, ideological narcissism. It creates a myth that is irrefutable (much in the way that **an image’s “truth” cannot be disproved**), in perpetuity, because of its authoritarian, unrestrained nature."

* “Television is a speed-of-light medium, a present-centered medium,” my father wrote. “Its grammar, so to say, permits no access to the past … history can play no significant role **in image politics**. For history is of value only to someone who takes seriously the notion that there are patterns in the past which may provide the present with nourishing traditions.”
