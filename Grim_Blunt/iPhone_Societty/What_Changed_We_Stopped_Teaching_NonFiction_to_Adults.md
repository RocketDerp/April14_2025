# What Changed: *We* Stopped Teaching NonFiction to Adults

We, We *The People*   
Adult learners abandoned nonfiction books    
iPhone Society    
Since middle of year 2007, the Apple iPhone   
The Apple iPad   
The Android devices   
Hand-held media screens, in your face, not a TV across the room!    
That is *what changed* in year 2007.   

That is what changed. Adult education shifted from Fox News Cable TV, HDTV, over to smartphones / tablets. Internet devices. Meme devices. Memes.

People became addicted to fiction memes, streaming fiction content, fiction and more fiction.

* "For all the ways one can define **fascism** (and there are many), one essential trait is its allegiance to no idea of right but its own: it is, in short, ideological narcissism. It creates a myth that is irrefutable (much in the way that **an image’s “truth” cannot be disproved**), in perpetuity, because of its authoritarian, unrestrained nature."

* “Television is a speed-of-light medium, a present-centered medium,” my father wrote. “Its grammar, so to say, permits no access to the past … history can play no significant role **in image politics**. For history is of value only to someone who takes seriously the notion that there are patterns in the past which may provide the present with nourishing traditions.”

* "But it wasn’t simply the magnitude of TV exposure that was troubling. It was that the audience was being conditioned to get its information faster, in a way that was less nuanced and, of course, **image-based**. As my father pointed out, a written sentence has a level of verifiability to it: it is true or not true – or, at the very least, we can have a meaningful discussion over its truth. (This was pre-truthiness, pre-“alternative facts”.)"
