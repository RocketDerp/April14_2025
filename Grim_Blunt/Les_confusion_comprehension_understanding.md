# Lies Confusion Comprehension Understanding

&nbsp;

Humans can not distinguish misunderstandings from lies. It is a global problem throughout history.

And it is a mistake when we accept lies and manipulation, trick each other, becauses we are barely getting by with our grasp on truth and reality *without* manipulation. That's the point of Neil Postman and televisoin. "I do not mean to imply that television news **deliberately aims** to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result." - 1985

It is not deliberate, that's the reason I keep pointing to Neil Postman. We are tricked and bamboozled by our shallow superficial reactioons. We don't *need* someone trying to trick us, it happens because of the structure and venue.

# Deception, Self-Deception

Some ideas take hundreds of years and teams of thousands of people. Problems that were recognized but unsolved, such as germ theory. It wasn't until the invetion of microscope technology that we started to better undrestand diseases that seemed invisible.
