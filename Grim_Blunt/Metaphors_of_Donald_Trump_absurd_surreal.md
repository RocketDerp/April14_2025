I'm here out of complete desperation of lost language. Microcosim macrocosim. 

The Egg, do we need a transcendent narative USA?

"The 'monstrous, irrational, and unnatural' motifs in folktale and myth are derived from the reservoirs of dream and vision. On the dream level such images represent the total state of the individual dreaming psyche. But clarified of personal distortions and profounded by poets, prophets, and visionaries, they become symbolic of the spiritual norm for Man the Microcosm. They are thus phrases from an image-language, expressive of a metaphysical, psychological, and sociological truth."     
Joseph Campbell, from his Commentary to the Complete Grimm's Fairy Tales (an essay that also appears in Flight of the Wild Gander)

Neil Postman, The End of Education. A 'god' to serve   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnypvUQl6TI&t=38s    

For school to make sense, the young, their parents, and their teachers
0:10
must have a god to serve or, even better, several gods.    
0:17
If they have none, school is pointless.   
0:21
Nietzsche's famous remark is relevant here.
He said once:
'he who has a why to live, can bear with almost any how'
and this applies, I think, as much to learning as to living.     

0:40
To put it as I said it before, there is no surer way to bring an end to schooling than for it to have no end.    
0:52
Now by a god to serve, I do not necessarily mean the God, who is supposed to have created the world, and whose moral instructions, as described in sacred books, have given countless people a reason for living, and, more to the point, a reason for learning.     
1:16
In the Western world, beginning in the 13th century and for 500 years afterwards, that God was sufficient justification for the founding of institutions of learning, from grammar schools, where children were taught to read the Bible, to great universities, where men were trained to be ministers of God. Even today, there are some schools in the West, and most in the Islamic world, whose central purpose is to serve and celebrate the glory of God.    
1:58
Now, wherever this is the case, there is no school problem. Certainly, there is no school crisis. There may be some disputes over what subjects best promote piety, obedience, and faith.      
2:14
There may be students who are skeptical, even teachers who are nonbelievers.   
2:21
But at the core of such schools, there is a transcendent spiritual idea
that gives purpose and clarity to learning. To such schools the word God is spelt with a capital G.
But there are schools that have been animated by a transcendent spiritual idea
which may be called a god with a small g.    

2:51
Now I know it's risky for me to use this word, even with a small g,
because the word, having an aura of sacredness, is not to be used lightly
and also because it calls to mind a fixed figure or image.    
3:11
But it is the purpose of such figures or images
to direct one's mind to an idea,
and, more to the point, to a story.     

3:24
Not any kind of story,
but one that tells of origins and envisions of future,
a story that constructs ideals, prescribes rules of conduct,
provides a source of authority, and gives a sense of continuity and purpose.    
3:45
A god, in the sense I'm using the word, is the name of a great narrative,
one that has sufficient credibility, complexity, and symbolic power,
so that it's possible to organize one's life and one's learning around it.    
4:06
Without such a transcendent narrative, life has no meaning.    

4:12
Without meaning, learning has no purpose. Without purpose, schools become houses of detention, not attention.

## God to Serve: Donald Trump

In that 1995 book, Postman was right, and we did not develop the god to serve (we already had it, the 1776 Great Seal of the Uniited States of America god, the world wide web public libray of Ben Franklin - ***cherry picking from every science fiction story in the public library, not just science ficiton Quran, Torah, Bible from Levant***)...and Doanld Trump *became the Big Brand capital-G God* that the Internet Research Agency since March 2013 created with Cambridge Anaytica depth-charge monomyth payloads of the mind.

* “Public education does not serve a public. It creates a public. And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens?” ― Neil Postman, The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School. September 1995 (Year 2 of [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September))
