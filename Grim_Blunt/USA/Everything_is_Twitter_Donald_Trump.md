“Parents embraced “Sesame Street” for several reasons, among them that it assuaged their guilt over the fact that they could not or would not restrict their children’s access to television. “Sesame Street” appeared to justify allowing a four- or five-year-old to sit transfixed in front of a television screen for unnatural periods of time. Parents were eager to hope that television could teach their children something other than which breakfast cereal has the most crackle. At the same time, “Sesame Street” relieved them of the responsibility of teaching their pre-school children how to read—no small matter in a culture where children are apt to be considered a nuisance.... We now know that “Sesame Street” encourages children to love school only if school is like “Sesame Street.” Which is to say, we now know that “Sesame Street” undermines what the traditional idea of schooling represents.”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Everything is [Year 1993 Ditto-heads Adults](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/1993/08/28/dittoheads-limbaughs-faithful/) leading their Children with Trump role model.    
Everything is Spongebob Squarepants **May 1999** parenting who think Donald Trump is the most gifted and entertaining comedy ever created. Addicts to Rush Limbaugh and Spongebob praising Trump for the chuckles and mockery he provides.

&nbsp;

Just like a **October 8, 2013** book describes manic media society:

"It was shortly before the earthquake that Fazlullah had appeared in Imam Deri, a small village just a few miles outside Mingora on the other side of the Swat River, and set up his illegal radio station."

"In our valley we received most of our information from the radio because so many had no TV or are illiterate. Soon everyone seemed to be talking about the **radio station. It became known as Mullah FM and Fazlullah as the Radio Mullah. It broadcast every night** from eight to ten and again in the **morning** from seven to nine.

"In the beginning Fazlullah was very wise. He introduced himself as an Islamic reformer and an interpreter of the Quran. My mother is very devout, and to start with she liked Fazlullah. He used his station to encourage people to adopt good habits and abandon practices he said were bad. He said men should keep their beards but give up smoking and using the tobacco they liked to chew. He said people should stop using heroin, and chars, which is our word for hashish. He told people the correct way to do their ablutions for prayers – which body part to wash first. He even told people how they should wash their private parts."
