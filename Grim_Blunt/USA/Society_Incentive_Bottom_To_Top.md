# Society Incentive Bottom To Top

We The People can't come toether and say: Jen Senko was right about right-wing media and stick to addressing the oversight / addressing not fixing the issues earlier.

Pandemic: Bill Gates 2015 Ted Talk

Occupy Wall Street: Trump, NYC, Fox News NYC    

Neil Postman: NYC   

Kamala Harris 2024: Right about Trump deployments   

Carl Sagan: 1995 book, January 1994 Washington Post public letter   

we can't make a named list of oversigns. Of unimportant things we minded while avoiding the serious important things.

# Hard teaching / research

We The People, BOTTOM UP, the people without power - do not incentive / praise bottom-up efforts. Unless it is actors / sports stars / video gamers / entertainers.

Not for resucing society fron problems, not for prevention like Neil Postman or Jen Senko or Carl Sagan - but we repeat over and over how a great sports star in year x set a record. Hall of Fame, etc.

We incenvize sports and wealth achievements, power achievements, not goodness guidance achievements. Not preentative misunderstandings. Not education achivements.
