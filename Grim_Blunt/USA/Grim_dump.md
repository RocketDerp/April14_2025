# Freedom to hate

The freedom to hate on Charlie Kirk is self-harm. It accomplishes nothing positive.

People have not built anything productive or goodness based forward. There is no call for anything but hate of Trump and mockery of Trump, when Trump himself is a constant source of hate and mockery.

People haven't been able to escape the conditioned reaction patterns of the Russian IRA since March 2013, and have fleshed them out into cliches and thought-terminating dead-ends.

There is a sustained faith in hate I've been repeating over and over. A sustained faith in mocking. Everyone in USA agrees on *hate harder, mock harder*. People never seem to tire of the constant spare time and free time spent on hate and mocking with social machines / media machines.

Goodness is avoided. Nonfiction discussion of mob mentality avoided. Nonfiction discussion of Russian information warfare avoided.

## Nonfiction matters

Non-entertainment, not-amusement, non-fiction matters. People with the spare time and free time to use social media machines to spread pranks, tricks, manipulation, falsehoods, lies, Edward Bernays techniques, Cambridge Analytica techniques, deception against other people every hour of every day as a form of entertainment. Donald Trump does so with Truth Social, and hundreds of millions of people in USA adopt these values and behaviors with no resistance. People cheer it on. People think it is hilarious and fumy and LOL LOL with meme images / amusement jokes at the suffering of other people who do not comprehend or understand they are being manipulated by billionaires who tell everyone to flock to the advertising and marketing messages instead of flocking to Wikipedia common ground and seeing how much we as humans all have as common needs and common concerns. Because "common-ism" sounds like "communism". Which I don't support FORCED marketing and advertising manipulation / trickery any more than forced communism. One has to reach a level of volunteer desire, shared compassion, shared understanding of the reliance we have on systems and values created and refined by other people. We all stand on the shoulders of all.

“Public education does not exist for the benefit of students or the benefit of their parents. It exists for the benefit of the social order.

We have discovered as a species that it is useful to have an educated population. You do not need to be a student or have a child who is a student to benefit from public education. Every second of every day of your life, you benefit from public education.

So let me explain why I like to pay taxes for schools, even though I don't personally have a kid in school: It's because I don't like living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.”      
― John Green

“Public education does not serve a public. It creates a public. And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens?”
― Neil Postman, The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School, September 1995 (Eternal September year 1)

## I do not mean children education

These quotes above are in the context of public educaiton for children. But I also address the educaiton people get off Fox News, Bluesky, Reddit. The spare time and free time people use to educate themselves about sports stars, film stars, award ceremonies, sports contests, video game high scores and records, new entertainment, mocking of Donald Trump, hate cheering of Trump, the spectacle of free time spent flocking to the few as amusement and entertainment.

I mean Wikipedia, I mean every day. Our health care, our food, our essentials in life, our relationship problems, both micro of our own depressions and need for compassion and love, our own family, our own community, our own city, our own state, our own nation, our own world Earth, our own universe / Cosmos. I mean Wikipedia. I mean WikiTribune year 2017 effort: https://www.wired.com/story/jimmy-wales-is-having-another-crack-at-wikitribune/

Why do we complain and complain and criticize and criticize "the media" when many of us know how incredibly low cost it is to build and create text-based information systems like Wikipedia software. And how they can download and share the entire database of text. Why do people critiize and criticize copyright on free-time spare-time social media Reddit and encourage piracy - instead of working to address that nonfiction should not be copyrighted! Wikipedia commons of medical knowledge of the human body, a WikiMedicalAll system - as WE ALL HAVE human body! We all eat foods and have allergies and problems related to eating food! We all drink water and have problems with pollutions. We all have a common interest in learning medical knowledge from some other person's injury / discovery / caretaking of a family member. Cancer death and loss of each other is incentive enough, profit motive and wealth to rule over the health of other humans is not needed when there is a built-in reward from compassion and the labor of organizing information in a WikiMedicalAll system! We all benefit from knowing the drugs others are taking and their experiences and organizing this information into summary / detail patterns / personal experience language vs. summary langauge. Instead, we scroll off Bluesky and Reddit content - we constantly toss out information after 24 hours and repeat and repeat information instead of refining and going towards a Super Wikipedia style reference that any time day or night we can find organized drill-down levels of ideas and expereinces on our common subject. How many nonfiction books avoid repeating the same pargraphs because of profit motives / copyright income motivates / egoism of claiming that a paragraph is original! We are so concerned with competitition and being original we don't even seem to recognize that our free time and spare time goes into service of creating Reddit and Bluesky comments that drown out the best ideas and answers to issues - because we aren't organizing them into a common FAQ / Super Wikipedia / Best Practices / Best Writings / Best Teachings systemss that are open and free to share and free to download for offline use by anyone in the world!

Dr. Stephan Hoeller examines the philosophic basis for freedom as expressed in the writings of the Gnostics and Carl Jung. He relates this philosophy to that of America's founders and to such recent events as the collapse of Communist regimes throughout the world.
