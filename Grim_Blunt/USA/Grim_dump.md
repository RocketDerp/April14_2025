# Freedom to hate

The freedom to hate on Charlie Kirk is self-harm. It accomplishes nothing positive.

People have not built anything productive or goodness based forward. There is no call for anything but hate of Trump and mockery of Trump, when Trump himself is a constant source of hate and mockery.

People haven't been able to escape the conditioned reaction patterns of the Russian IRA since March 2013, and have fleshed them out into cliches and thought-terminating dead-ends.

There is a sustained faith in hate I've been repeating over and over. A sustained faith in mocking. Everyone in USA agrees on *hate harder, mock harder*. People never seem to tire of the constant spare time and free time spent on hate and mocking with social machines / media machines.

Goodness is avoided. Nonfiction discussion of mob mentality avoided. Nonfiction discussion of Russian information warfare avoided.

## Nonfiction matters

Non-entertainment, not-amusement, non-fiction matters. People with the spare time and free time to use social media machines to spread pranks, tricks, manipulation, falsehoods, lies, Edward Bernays techniques, Cambridge Analytica techniques, deception against other people every hour of every day as a form of entertainment. Donald Trump does so with Truth Social, and hundreds of millions of people in USA adopt these values and behaviors with no resistance. People cheer it on. People think it is hilarious and fumy and LOL LOL with meme images / amusement jokes at the suffering of other people who do not comprehend or understand they are being manipulated by billionaires who tell everyone to flock to the advertising and marketing messages instead of flocking to Wikipedia common ground and seeing how much we as humans all have as common needs and common concerns. Because "common-ism" sounds like "communism". Which I don't support FORCED marketing and advertising manipulation / trickery any more than forced communism. One has to reach a level of volunteer desire, shared compassion, shared understanding of the reliance we have on systems and values created and refined by other people. We all stand on the shoulders of all.

“Public education does not exist for the benefit of students or the benefit of their parents. It exists for the benefit of the social order.

We have discovered as a species that it is useful to have an educated population. You do not need to be a student or have a child who is a student to benefit from public education. Every second of every day of your life, you benefit from public education.

So let me explain why I like to pay taxes for schools, even though I don't personally have a kid in school: It's because I don't like living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.”      
― John Green

“Public education does not serve a public. It creates a public. And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens?”
― Neil Postman, The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School, September 1995 (Eternal September year 1)

Dr. Stephan Hoeller examines the philosophic basis for freedom as expressed in the writings of the Gnostics and Carl Jung. He relates this philosophy to that of America's founders and to such recent events as the collapse of Communist regimes throughout the world.
