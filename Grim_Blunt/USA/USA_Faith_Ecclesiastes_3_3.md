Here in USA, people treat fiction Bible as nonfiction.

People are taught by their parents in USA from Bible verse Ecclesiastes 3:3

That there is a "season" for self-harm, a "season" for the Satan / Devil like Donald Trump to lead. This is a terrible education and parenting. That WE MUST have badness to vote into office.
