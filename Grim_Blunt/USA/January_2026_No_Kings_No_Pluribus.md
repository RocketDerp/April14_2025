# January 2026: No Kings, No Pluribus

Chanting "no Kings" year 2025 is only scratching the surface    
Waving a flag is scratching the surface.

"No Kings" was reactionary to Trump producing King messages about NYC.
Flag Waving - people don't even celebrate it as 50 groups coming together in Pluribus unity. They celebrate it like a sports team owner logo.

Chanting:

1. "We the People
2. Pluribus, Great Seal USA
3. Love one another
4. February 28, 1954 a teacher from Atlanta USA cracked the code on hate. And we don't desire hate.
5. Open and free medical knowledge and school teaching information, training, courseware
6. We see the errors of our way: Fox News isn't just one man Murdoch, it's an attraction like Neil Postman wrote 11 years before Fox News, in 1985 book vs. October 7, 1996 Fox.
7. We can't chant: we see an error, we are learning our error, "Amused To Death" is Fox News. We let it go for nearly 30 years since October 7, 1996 and we were way too slow to recognize what [prizing "Celebration of Ignorance" does to us](/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md), we all, we the people, Pluribus.


Instead, we are so good at marketing and advertising Trump rules and so do hundreds of other aggressive men next in in for Trump.

Because that's it. That's what we mastered.   
Edward Bernays and Surkov anti-thinking is what we mastered.  
We have mastered Enter Shikari "Discovery of Strings"    
We have mastered how to manipulate the brain with Celebration of Ignorance.   
We have mastered how to make junk information, Trump White House antics, the center of all language and understanding.    
We have mastered how to shit-talk so good, to advertise and market and create low-importance sports entertainment, we created the "FIFA world peace prize"     
We are so good at creating stadiums and product of television of sports events, "Celebration of Ignorance" anti-learning anti-teaching anti-school, for the sports players of the school, that the Great Seal became less important, eclipsed by "FIFA world peace prize".

This isn't a joke. No joke can out-joke "Celebration of Ignorance" and what we have become, We the People, all of us, Pluribus. It isn't a joke, Infinite Jest joking out-jokes any joke. There is no satire, there is no sarcasm. The Pluribus TV series even tried to highlight that satire and sarcasm of a drunken woman playing with a loaded weapon she took zero time to study or analyze.

People don't get the spirit of terrorism. https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/03/06/l-esprit-du-terrorisme-par-jean-baudrillard_879920_3382.html - I did it, after 9, 11, 2001 (September 11, 2001) I had enough of seeing USA adopt what was delivered on 9/11. Shallow chanting, advertising of Levant religions in such a "Celebration of Ignorance" way... living in Texas, of all Trump places, in year 2007 and 2008, I saw "Celebration of Ignorance" from the Linux community. An anti-Pluribus attitude of we need to make it stable on laptops and all get on Ubuntu and stop being so diverse, or even consider OpenBSD - until hardware and operating system drivers settle down. But ultimately, Google Android and phones replaced desktop multi-media Linux and laptops. 

I purchased a cheap Walmart (not even one they sell, but through their online store) laptop out of a kind of stupid choice. And it runs Ubuntu.. but sound does not work. That's exaclty the shit I was owrking on in 2007 at Linux users groups in Austin. WiFi chips and sounds, which Linux servers don't use. Touchpads. My god is the Touchpad in Linux a mess still.  Server farms don't have touchpad drivers like laptops do. WiFi, sound, touchpad... these drivers are constantly a mess. and nobody wants to pay. 

But that's because we don't take on copyright laws / consumer laws. Closed source drivers for Windows shouldn't be allowed.  Copyright law should require certification process and documentation for device drivers for hardware sellers. A consumer right to not be bamboozled by hardware with shitty drivers that can't be fixed / patched.

I realized in 2007 that Linux wasn't progressing on laptops, not since 1997 / 1998 when I experimented seriously with desktop Linux. But Austin community didn't want to lead a movement of technical writing and organizing efforts to address { touchpad, power management / resume suspend, WiFi, sound drivers } that non-servers had, desktops and laptops had. Give up all the exotic distros and make Ubuntu great. The IDEAL in the name of Ubuntu, a spiritual ideal. But Austin didn't want to do it.

* "Debian became usable as a real distribution with its first public releases in the 0.9x series during 1994-1995, but truly solidified as a stable, widely-known OS with the first official 1.0 release, Debian 1.1 (Buzz), in June 1996"


This year 2020 story was late to describe what has already happened since June 16, 2015

Everyone said Trump was a joke. It's true. Infinite Jest is EVERYONE. We the People, Pluribus, are infinite jesting away goodness.

We actually prize jokes and mocking, mocking on subreddits and Bluesky and at voting booths and mocking with corporate brand teams and political teams sports mentality...

how can anyone look at world war one and world war two and want to be on ANY team. World War Two: Russia, USA, Geramny, Japan. ALL TEAMS BAD, war itself is bad!

But we can't escape the "Celebration of Ignorance" we are too good at convincing ourselves that inequality and wealth in the hands of high score money high score real estate map people is all that matters.

There is no freedom from this problem. "On the Turning Away" from Pink Floyd... how old is that song? It didn't work. No more than Joseph Campbell 1987 and 1988 books on "PLuribus' didn't work. The Great Seal didn't work. We printed it everyone and it became "Illunati LOL LOL LOL LMAO LMAO ILLUMNATI Conspiracy LOL LOL OL" joke  It (Greet Seal LOL) is indite jest itself!
