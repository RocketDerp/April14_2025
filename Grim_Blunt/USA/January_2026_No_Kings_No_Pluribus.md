# January 2026: No Kings, No Pluribus

Chanting "no Kings" year 2025 is only scratching the surface    
Waving a flag is scratching the surface.

"No Kings" was reactionary to Trump producing King messages about NYC.
Flag Waving - people don't even celebrate it as 50 groups coming together in Pluribus unity. They celebrate it like a sports team owner logo.

Chanting:

1. "We the People
2. Pluribus, Great Seal USA
3. Love one another
4. February 28, 1954 a teacher from Atlanta USA cracked the code on hate. And we don't desire hate.
5. Open and free medical knowledge and school teaching information, training, courseware
6. We see the errors of our way: Fox News isn't just one man Murdoch, it's an attraction like Neil Postman wrote 11 years before Fox News, in 1985 book vs. October 7, 1996 Fox.
7. We can't chant: we see an error, we are learning our error, "Amused To Death" is Fox News. We let it go for nearly 30 years since October 7, 1996 and we were way too slow to recognize what [prizing "Celebration of Ignorance" does to us](/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md), we all, we the people, Pluribus.


Instead, we are so good at marketing and advertising Trump rules and so do hundreds of other aggressive men next in in for Trump.

Because that's it. That's what we mastered.   
Edward Bernays and Surkov anti-thinking is what we mastered.  
We have mastered Enter Shikari "Discovery of Strings"    
We have mastered how to manipulate the brain with Celebration of Ignorance.   
We have mastered how to make junk information, Trump White House antics, the center of all language and understanding.    
We have mastered how to shit-talk so good, to advertise and market and create low-importance sports entertainment, we created the "FIFA world peace prize"     
We are so good at creating stadiums and product of television of sports events, "Celebration of Ignorance" anti-learning anti-teaching anti-school, for the sports players of the school, that the Great Seal became less important, eclipsed by "FIFA world peace prize".

This isn't a joke. No joke can out-joke "Celebration of Ignorance" and what we have become, We the People, all of us, Pluribus. It isn't a joke, Infinite Jest joking out-jokes any joke. There is no satire, there is no sarcasm. The Pluribus TV series even tried to highlight that satire and sarcasm of a drunken woman playing with a loaded weapon she took zero time to study or analyze.

People don't get the spirit of terrorism. https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/03/06/l-esprit-du-terrorisme-par-jean-baudrillard_879920_3382.html - I did it, after 9, 11, 2001 (September 11, 2001) I had enough of seeing USA adopt what was delivered on 9/11. Shallow chanting, advertising of Levant religions in such a "Celebration of Ignorance" way... living in Texas, of all Trump places, in year 2007 and 2008, I saw "Celebration of Ignorance" from the Linux community. An anti-Pluribus attitude of we need to make it stable on laptops and all get on Ubuntu and stop being so diverse, or even consider OpenBSD - until hardware and operating system drivers settle down. But ultimately, Google Android and phones replaced desktop multi-media Linux and laptops. 

I purchased a cheap Walmart (not even one they sell, but through their online store) laptop out of a kind of stupid choice. And it runs Ubuntu.. but sound does not work. That's exaclty the shit I was owrking on in 2007 at Linux users groups in Austin. WiFi chips and sounds, which Linux servers don't use. Touchpads. My god is the Touchpad in Linux a mess still.  Server farms don't have touchpad drivers like laptops do. WiFi, sound, touchpad... these drivers are constantly a mess. and nobody wants to pay. 

But that's because we don't take on copyright laws / consumer laws. Closed source drivers for Windows shouldn't be allowed.  Copyright law should require certification process and documentation for device drivers for hardware sellers. A consumer right to not be bamboozled by hardware with shitty drivers that can't be fixed / patched.

I realized in 2007 that Linux wasn't progressing on laptops, not since 1997 / 1998 when I experimented seriously with desktop Linux. But Austin community didn't want to lead a movement of technical writing and organizing efforts to address { touchpad, power management / resume suspend, WiFi, sound drivers } that non-servers had, desktops and laptops had. Give up all the exotic distros and make Ubuntu great. The IDEAL in the name of Ubuntu, a spiritual ideal. But Austin didn't want to do it.

* "Debian became usable as a real distribution with its first public releases in the 0.9x series during 1994-1995, but truly solidified as a stable, widely-known OS with the first official 1.0 release, Debian 1.1 (Buzz), in June 1996"

* "In 2007, Ubuntu was widely considered the most popular and fastest-growing Linux distribution, gaining significant traction for its user-friendliness, major releases like Feisty Fawn (7.04) and Gutsy Gibbon (7.10), and commercial adoption, including being sold pre-installed on Dell laptops. It won awards, drew huge community engagement, and its growth made desktop Linux a major topic."

* 2015 Statement: At the Microsoft Ignite conference in 2015, a developer evangelist stated that Windows 10 would be the "last version of Windows".

My god, if Austin had gotten everyone to focus on "10 years of Ubuntu" movement - sacrifice diversity for the sake of advancing a great kernel and laptop / desktop experience. Then go back to diverse distros and package managers and flatpacks and snaps replacing .deb files for major key apps (Firefox). https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1ps8chh/i_just_replaced_the_snap_version_of_firefox_with/

And I started to like the meaning of the word Ubuntu even ment. Nobody wanted to work togete and take on Microsoft with actual better desktop and laptop experience. WiFi, Sound, touchpad, were a mess on consumer laptops in 2007. Just imagine where things would be by 2015 if 7 years of focused organized messaging to get hardware vendors in line with free open drivers for Ubuntu Linux (and OpenBSD as the second-platform for hardware support, to get vendors to always deliver their  best drivers).

# year 2020

Latin word Pluribus.

**THERE IS A POPULATION** of people PROGRAMMED that "Free Mason" is to be mocked. They come out of the woodwork over Pluribus. It took me time to really realize all my Great Seal teaching since year 2009 has been witnessing this. Nobody quotes Campbell's two books. NEVER a "Today I learned" on Reddi that gets repeated like all the other TIL topics. 

Is it the clergy, the religions poisoning the Great Seal? is it Russia / China? is it just "Celebration of Ignorance" as Carl Sagan 1995, Neil Postman 1985? Campbell said movies was unfortunate, not done like clergy, not done like James Joyce.

last night was my big awakening if I can hold on to it. There is a movement to extreme-banlize Ubuntu concept, Pluribus

# Africa Ubuntu == Latin Pluribus

Ironically the Great Seal pyramid being in Africa / Library of Alexnadria ideals, was damn close to ubuntu! But I don't think Campbell or James Joyce or Founding Fathers ever heard of Ubuntu out of africa.

well I just looked it up mid-sentence, BINGO

* "Ubuntu philosophy is ancient, rooted in Bantu cultures for centuries, but as a formalized "philosophy" or "worldview," it gained traction in writing from the 1950s, popularized globally by leaders like Mandela and Tutu in the 1990s, though written references to the term itself date back to at least 1846. It's not a new idea but an enduring indigenous African ethic emphasizing interconnectedness, community, and shared humanity, often summarized as "I am because we are" or "a person is a person through other people"

Holly fucking shit. I traveled to Africa to live, Ubuntu in hand, and I never got it into my head how new the term was.

# year 1776 meets year 1846

1. "The motto "E Pluribus Unum" was proposed in the 1776 draft of the Great Seal by the first committee (Adams, Franklin, Jefferson) and officially adopted with the final seal by Congress in 1782, appearing on the eagle's scroll"

2. Ubuntu: "Missionaries and linguists, including Hare et al. (1846), < Appleyard (1850), and < Colenso (1855), documented ubuntu as a human moral quality in Nguni languages."

Step back here: 1776 had a WORLD change, "new world order" to go along. But Ubuntu people had no organized effort o make it a world-wide ideal. Which they really didn't know how terrible history was globally, where USA founding fathers had lived on the other side of the Atlantic and London and Paris had good library systems in say year 1706 with the Germany invention of the Gutenberg printing press (everything is media ecology).

Step back here: Ubuntu was oral tradition before year 1846, but the cool ting is that the idea is prizing of goodness. God damn, prizing of goodness! Not prizing a weapon system, not prizing hate like we lived all year 2025 prizing hate and prizing mocking. But people coming and studying language and concepts and it it being matched with Linux.

* "The Linux kernel's GPL adoption timeline began in 1992 when Linus Torvalds relicensed it from a restrictive custom license to the GNU GPL (version 2), starting with kernel version 0.12, a pivotal move"

# Same ideas: Linux, Ubuntu Philosophy, Pluribus Philosophy 

And Galatians 3:28, of course! ESPECIALLY if you remove "believe", "book supremacy" defang the Levant clergy.

# Shift thinking conetxt: Anti-Pluribus speak

The mocking back and forth: Libtard, MAGA, libtard, MAGA, leopards eat faces, MAGA, libtard, leopards eat faces. The out-group hate vs. hate, hate for hate, hate harder, hate prizing of every single person in USA who hasn't turned to February 28, 1954 MLK writings. NOBODY in USA doesn't have these in their near by public library or WikiQuote advertising-free website! [NOBODY has any reason since year 2013 to NOT find these February 28, 1954 words](/Quotes_Pile/Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md). Pluribus words.

There are licensing and such issues of two songs: What the world Needs Now, Love is in Need of Love Stevie Wonder. But again, almost every person since year 2013 in USA can find these two songs. They are not deleted, they are not expensive, you can find cover versions to save money.

## The Anti-Pluribus described

This year 2020 story was late to describe what has already happened since June 16, 2015 or March 2013.

It took THIS LONG for a simple way to describe it. And the worst hing is, like Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 film. Nobody repeats it like "Epstein" "Pizzagate", "Gamergate" word repeating. Jen Sekno's name should be repeated and asserted. A household name of a hero in USA. And this Septembrer 2020 article should be repeated an known and re-peated, remembred, reminded, repeated:

Everyone said Trump was a joke. It's true. Infinite Jest is EVERYONE. We the People, Pluribus, are infinite jesting away goodness.

We actually prize jokes and mocking, mocking on subreddits and Bluesky and at voting booths and mocking with corporate brand teams and political teams sports mentality...

how can anyone look at world war one and world war two and want to be on ANY team. World War Two: Russia, USA, Geramny, Japan. ALL TEAMS BAD, war itself is bad!

But we can't escape the "Celebration of Ignorance" we are too good at convincing ourselves that inequality and wealth in the hands of high score money high score real estate map people is all that matters.

There is no freedom from this problem. "On the Turning Away" from Pink Floyd... how old is that song? It didn't work. No more than Joseph Campbell 1987 and 1988 books on "PLuribus' didn't work. The Great Seal didn't work. We printed it everyone and it became "Illunati LOL LOL LOL LMAO LMAO ILLUMNATI Conspiracy LOL LOL OL" joke  It (Greet Seal LOL) is indite jest itself!

I contacted the Pentagon in 2015. Samantha. Monday, August 17, 2015 afternoon. Which I disclosed, with my real name, on Facebook first (where real names are normal) and later on Reddit in public. https://old.reddit.com/r/QAnonRussia/comments/p16nkm/i_reported_it_in_2015_under_bidenobama_at_the/ August 9, 2021

Monday, August 17, 2015 afternoon - I still recall what I said to Samantha: Joseph Campbell, the new star wars film was coming out at Christmas, and Campbell had died in 1987, but he was tied to Star wars. That's what I said to the Pentagon. They even invited me to Washington D.C., but I said I couldn't afford to self-fund it, and they didn't offer me any kind of pay. D.C. is expensive, and I didn't know a soul there. This was Obama/Biden...

I had no idea it was Russia in 2015. Anyway, the Reddit posting of August 9, 2021 nobody gives a shit. There it is
