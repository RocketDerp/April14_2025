# January 2026: No Kings, No Pluribus

Chanting "no Kings" year 2025 is only scratching the surface    
Waving a flag is scratching the surface.

"No Kings" was reactionary to Trump producing King messages about NYC.
Flag Waving - people don't even celebrate it as 50 groups coming together in Pluribus unity. They celebrate it like a sports team owner logo.

Chanting:

1. "We the People
2. Pluribus, Great Seal USA
3. Love one another
4. February 28, 1954 a teacher from Atlanta USA cracked the code on hate. And we don't desire hate.
5. Open and free medical knowledge and school teaching information, training, courseware

Instead, we are so good at marketing and advertising Trump rules and so do hundreds of other aggressive men next in in for Trump.

Because that's it. That's what we mastered.   
Edward Bernays and Surkov anti-thinking is what we mastered.  
We have mastered Enter Shikari "Discovery of Strings"    
We have mastered how to manipulate the brain with Celebration of Ignorance.   
We have mastered how to make junk information, Trump White House antics, the center of all language and understanding.

This year 2020 story was late to describe what has already happened since June 16, 2015

Everyone said Trump was a joke. It's true. Infinite Jest is EVERYONE. We the People, Pluribus, are infinite jesting away goodness.

We actually prize jokes and mocking, mocking on subreddits and Bluesky and at voting booths and mocking with corporate brand teams and political teams sports mentality...

how can anyone look at world war one and world war two and want to be on ANY team. World War Two: Russia, USA, Geramny, Japan. ALL TEAMS BAD, war itself is bad!

But we can't escape the "Celebration of Ignorance" we are too good at convincing ourselves that inequality and wealth in the hands of high score money high score real estate map people is all that matters.

There is no freedom from this problem. "On the Turning Away" from Pink Floyd... how old is that song? It didn't work. No more than Joseph Campbell 1987 and 1988 books on "PLuribus' didn't work. The Great Seal didn't work. We printed it everyone and it became "Illunati LOL LOL LOL LMAO LMAO ILLUMNATI Conspiracy LOL LOL OL" joke  It (Greet Seal LOL) is indite jest itself!
