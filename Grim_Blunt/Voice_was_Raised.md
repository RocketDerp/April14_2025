Social media users continue to grey-rock #MalalaYousafzai with her intelligent and progressive ideas, reformation, writings, communications. 

So many people support hate and dehumanization of "the other", avoiding "love one another" on Earth.

&nbsp;

"Malala Yousafzai began blogging in early 2009 for the BBC Urdu service. She was 11 years old"

nbsp;

I was in Austin Texas in 2009 and I was contemplating what being in high school was like in USA vs year 1985 for my own life.

We were connected much more in 2009 than in 1986, the population of people across theworldis larger, but love and compassion was not something people saught out or cultivated in 2009.

Do people recognize that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's reformations on love, compassion, economics, hate, war were not being repeated. That ideas had been compiled into books - but very little attraction was shown to those books.

Martin Luther King Jr's ideas go far beyond USA and skin color of bkack vs. white. Yet, I did not witness someone in Austin, Texas in 2009 who was saying the same or even better. what I saw in autin was Alex Jones.

Car wrecks excite people, arson fires excite people, war killing excites people, military technology and military hardware excites people

The attraction to hate and war became obvious in USA in 2015 with Donald Trump. And here it is in year 2025 and no end in sight that people are attracted to hate, dehumanization, harming the Earth.

Malala Yousafzai does what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr did... she treats people like they do not understand or comprehend love. Living in a toxic ocean of hate, mass dehumanization is not romantic. those war films that depict one coule falling in love while others die and suffer is not inspiring when it has become the normal, the pattern, and happens over and over in mutiple places of geography and time.

A flower that grows in a toxic poison isn't the inspiring sign of goodness that some have made it out to be.

Malala Yousafzai is saying that things suck, that this is bad, and why are we not attracted to goodness and betterment in Swat Valley Pakistan.

And Martin Luther King Jr in 1954 was saying in Gerogia USA that things suck, this is bad, and why are we not attracted to goodness and betterment.

Here in 2025, people are so satisfied with some tiny drops of goodness, some TV show, or a few hours with loved ones each week... that they can tolerate Donald Trump's understanding of love and compassion... and Putin and Middle East war and Sudan and all the things going on around them?

Malala Yousafzai does what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr did... she treats people like they do not understand or comprehend love. She reads history and other people's ideas and concludes: we are liing in failure to comprehending. We don't undrestand love and compassion. Malala recognizes that what we are teaching children and what we are favoring is shit. Malala Yousafzai does what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr did... she treats people like they do not understand or comprehend love. 

People who get sports games and TV series and that's enough to satisfy them living in a world where people are attracted to Donald trump year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025. And all the people attracted to the MAGA movement and values.

These are bad things, badness itself, anti-compassion, anti-empathy, anti-goodness. 

Malala Yousafzai does what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr did... she treats people like they do not understand or comprehend love.

Mob mentality of various kinds in year 2015 resulted in Donald Trump being a constant center of attention and being President in 2016. In year 2025, that has not stopped. The attraction to negative and discarding of goodness.

Malala reads books and senses in the world that education has failed, that teaching has failed, and we need to keep revisiting our literacy and questioning our comprehension and focus on our learning.

Did people not notice in 2015 when Donald Trump popularity and attraction to shit became a constant trending? When the trajectory and trend became shit and hate? Did people not see it. I think they did not see it. they did not see it in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025.

Now I have studied media ecology. Inclusive of the making of the Aja studio album by Steely Dan, and attendance of Steely Dan live performances before the death of Walter Becker (died in 2017). I saw Steely dan in California, Colorado, Flordia, Illinois (3 times), Texas ... between year 2004 and 2010. I have studied many who cover their songs, many live performance recordings, etc.

I have seen the labor that goes into creating 4 minutes of music. I have seen the labor that goes into 93 minutes of a film or 43 minutes of a television episode.

I have seen the labor that goes into a book and into a graphic novel and worlds of art.

And my words will never be good enough. This page I am composing right now will never satisfy the public mind. It is truth that I am drowned in all the shit of all the world and I am broken by it, and everyone seems broken by it, and even those who labor and edit and refine their communications to the perfect song stillfail to get people to see how bad and terrible the flocking to shit, the seeking of shit, the seeking of Taliban and seeking of Donald Trump has become.
