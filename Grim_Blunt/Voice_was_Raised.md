Social media users continue to grey-rock #MalalaYousafzai with her intelligent and progressive ideas, reformation, writings, communications. 

So many people support hate and dehumanization of "the other", avoiding "love one another" on Earth.

"Malala Yousafzai began blogging in early 2009 for the BBC Urdu service. She was 11 years old"

I was in Austin Texas in 2009 and I was contemplating what being in high school was like in USA vs year 1985 for my own life.

We were connected much more in 2009 than in 1986, the population of people across theworldis larger, but love and compassion was not something people saught out or cultivated in 2009.

Do people recognize that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's reformations on love, compassion, economics, hate, war were not being repeated. That ideas had been compiled into books - but very little attraction was shown to those books.

Martin Luther King Jr's ideas go far beyond USA and skin color of bkack vs. white. Yet, I did not witness someone in Austin, Texas in 2009 who was saying the same or even better. what I saw in autin was Alex Jones.

Car wrecks excite people, arson fires excite people, war killing excites people, military technology and military hardware excites people

The attraction to hate and war became obvious in USA in 2015 with Donald Trump. And here it is in year 2025 and no end in sight that people are attracted to hate, dehumanization, harming the Earth.

Malala Yousafzai does what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr did... she treats people like they do not understand or comprehend love. Living in a toxic ocean of hate, mass dehumanization is not romantic. those war films that depict one coule falling in love while others die and suffer is not inspiring when it has become the normal, the pattern, and happens over and over in mutiple places of geography and time.

A flower that grows in a toxic poison isn't the inspiring sign of goodness that some have made it out to be.

Malala Yousafzai is saying that things suck, that this is bad, and why are we not attracted to goodness and betterment in Swat Valley Pakistan.

And Martin Luther King Jr in 1954 was saying in Gerogia USA that things suck, this is bad, and why are we not attracted to goodness and betterment.

Here in 2025, people are so satisfied with some tiny drops of goodness, some TV show, or a few hours with loved ones each week... that they can tolerate Donald trump and Putin and Middle East war and Sudan and all the things going on around them?

People who get sports games and TV series and that's enough to satisfy them living in a world where people are attracted to Donald trump year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025. And all the people attracted to the MAGA movement and values.

These are bad things, badness itself, anti-compassion, anti-empathy, anti-goodness. 

Malala Yousafzai does what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr did... she treats people like they do not understand or comprehend love. Living in a toxic ocean of hate, mass dehumanization is not romantic. those war films that depict one coule falling in love while others die and suffer is not inspiring when it has become the normal, the pattern, and happens over and over in mutiple places of geography and time.
