"I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed.
The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life."

Osama bin Laden (أسامة بن لادن)

### The solution came to September 11, 2001

January 2009. Blogging. 

October 8, 2013. A book was published.

"Our military and ISI are very powerful and most people did not like to voice these things publicly, but my father and many of his friends were not scared. ‘What you are doing is against our people and against Pakistan,’ he would say. ‘Don’t support Talibanisation, it’s inhuman. We are told that Swat is being sacrificed for the sake of Pakistan, but no one and nothing should be sacrificed for the state. A state is like a mother, and a mother never deserts or cheats her children.’
He hated the fact that most people would not speak up. In his pocket he kept a poem written by Martin Niemöller, who had lived in Nazi Germany.

First they came for the communists,    
and I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t a communist.    
Then they came for the socialists,    
and I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t a socialist.   
Then they came for the trade unionists,    
and I didn’t speak out because I wasn’t a trade unionist.    
Then they came for the Jews,    
and I didn’t speak out because I was not a Jew.   
Then they came for the Catholics,    
and I didn’t speak out because I was not a Catholic.    
Then they came for me,    
and there was no one left to speak for me.    "
