# Russian people under Putin

The American attitude is that anyone supporting Putin and Trump are:

1. Dumb
2. Idiot
3. Stupid
4. Fox News
5. Moron

So all Russians under Putin for the past 25 years...

# Surkov Governing

"Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way.

He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics."
