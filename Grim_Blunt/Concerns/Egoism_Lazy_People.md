# People unwilling to look up facts

Lazy about fact-checking and sharing to Wikipedia or authoring a book.

Re-inventing the wheel over and over because people would rather follow tradition than improve a process with thinking.

ToDo; MLK Jr pains people thinking

Rather keep having world wars and fight hard in trench warfare than think science and invent nuclear bomb.

Anti-intellectual lazy. Very hard working to serve a factory owner and make him rick but very against union organizations and working together to help others. "October Sky" strike settlement themes of the coal mine. Very hard workers of coal mining / long hours / health risks / collapse risks. (ToDo OPERA_A Quadrophena driver of bus of coal miners)

Working very hard at vanity and branding of Donald Trump - but very little work on studying and analyzing ideas of long-term future other than to make rich people richer with exploitative "return to Kingdoms" Project 2025.

And for a video game, the speedrunner is often more famous than the game programming author and game designers / story writers. Same with car racing. So much safety planning goes into the track design and construction, but a driver is where audiences put the attention. Waiter / server vs. person who designs the supply chain and cook.

### World Peace

How many Malala's pick up the pen after September 11, 2001 learning and Taliban in Swat Valley?

Lazy to be a hard-working German soldier who kills 7 people in France and Russia invading Moscow? Or is it lazy to not stand up to toxic clergy of region in Germany who supports killing people in London with bombs delivered from the sky? Or killing Jewish people in multiple nations, not just Germany. The hard work and labor of killing all those Jewish people is not lazy.
