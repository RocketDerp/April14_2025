Does it come as any surprise when people have the $1 Bill in their hand, and can't get any aspect of the Great Seal of the Founding Fathers interpretation correct? How massive our ignorance is on the human brain and symbolism power?

Joseph Campbell, 1986, Lucas SkyWalker Ranch interview: *All men are capable of reason \[thinking\]. That is the fundamental principle of democracy. Because everybody's mind is capable of true knowledge...*

And of course, anti-knowledge. Anti-reason is absurd antics, the White House under Trump. All men are capable of masturbating to simulations of sports, A vs. B polarity logic, Domination "winning", Authority "ruling", behavior too. And that is what we do, that is now the USA.

It is not reversing course. It should be.

*That moved not only the people who drew that \[Great\] Seal \[of the United States of America\], but the entire philosophy the early republic was based upon. And how utterly deplorable and regrettable and terrible it is that all of this has been virtually totally forgotten by our days. [] The American People have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others one of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away. And how incredibly unfortunate and terrible this is. And, I know for a fact, that Joseph Campbell feels this very very keenly.*       
- Stephan A. Hoeller, 1986 or 1987

USA people are BLIND to Systemic Attacks, as all they see is direct CGI rendering in art

See sidebar of this subreddit, Rick Roderick's 7-hour concept from 1993:

======================================

*Now, I have read about many historical periods. But not one in which you can talk to young people the way you can at the college level today, and find out that they believe… nothing. Want… nothing. Hope… nothing. Expect… nothing. Dream… nothing. Desire… nothing. Push ’em far enough and they’ll say: “Yeah, I gotta get a job. Spent a lot of money at Duke.” That’s not what I am talking about. They hope nothing. Expect nothing. Dream nothing. Desire nothing.*

*And it is a fair question to ask whether a society that produces this reaction in its young is worthy of existence at all. It really is. It’s worth asking that. Whether it’s worth being here at all. And my criticism of this society couldn’t get more bitter than it is in that case. It couldn’t possibly be. Remember, I am talking about the young I have encountered at Duke. These are privileged youth. At an elite southern school. Mostly white, mostly upper-middle to upper class. Now, imagine what the attitudes are like on the streets of DC, for another race or another social class. We have outlived in the 20th century the responses that Marcuse would have given to this.*

======================================

*When I was a kid I dreamed about dinosaurs. I had a little Walt Disney dinosaur book. Why would I need to dream about dinosaurs now? Steven Spielberg has made them. He has filmed them. They are more real than real dinosaurs. They are hyperreal. You would be disappointed if you saw a real Tyrannosaurus Rex after the movie. You would be disappointed. It wouldn’t be as noisy or as scary or as frightening. The same is true of Jaws, you know. I have actually caught some rather large sharks, I mean, I like to fish – you know, pier fish – so I have caught a few sharks, some of fairly good size. But those real experiences are so boring compared to Jaws. I mean Jaws is a hyperreal experience.*

*The only way… I mean there is no systematic way to discuss Baudrillard because these things are not systematic.*
