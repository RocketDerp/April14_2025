I agree with this, and we largely don't have the vocabulary to understand the ideals behind the USA's founding principal of reason and individuality vs. society. It can take a very long time, many years, to build up to the concepts... and we are failing to communicate even the scope of "this is simple, this is complex" with each other. It took a lot of learning on my part to fully grasp the concepts of reason and perspective that the USA government ideals are built upon.

It is possible, but it is not quick, and it demands some searing clarity of words and understanding.

New York Professor Joseph Campbell:

"Here you have the important transition that took place about 500 B.C. This is the date of the Buddha and of Pythagoras and Confucius and Lao-tzu, if there was a Lao-tzu. This is the awakening of man's reason. No longer is he informed and governed by the animal powers. No longer is he guided by the analogy of the planted earth, no longer by the courses of the planets -- but by reason."

...

"George Washington said, 'As a result of our revolution, we have disengaged ourselves from involvement in the chaos of Europe.' His last word was that we not engage in foreign alliances. Well, we held on to his words until the First World War. And then we canceled the Declaration of Independence and rejoined the British conquest of the planet. And so we are now on one side of the pyramid. We've moved from one to two. We are politically, historically, now a member of one side of an argument. We do not represent that principle of the eye up there. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason."
