> Our jealous God who told us to worship no other gods but Him (implying there are other gods) sounds pretty childish.

Our teaching is childish. /r/FictionNonFiction

1. Bible verse John 1:1 - the story is *words and only words*, *language and only language*, *memes and only memes*. Highly influential pattern of stories told in a poetic oral tradition that influence audiences like music does. It was spelled out 2,000 years ago.

2. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" - saying "I love Jesus" is wrong, you have never *seen Jesus*, you have only been exposed to fiction poetry of a story character. Same with "God".

3. The previous book commandments and laws no longer matter. You are in an impossible game that the rules can't possibly be followed, nobody is free of sin. Bible verse Romans 11:32 - God is the very source of sin, and there is no "Hell" (it is only a metaphor, not a place under the Earth, but a storytelling concept).

Shakespeare's Hamlet has a "Ghost", just a storytelling metaphor of very popular fiction. We still pass it down to our children as there are languages and lessons to learn. Same goes with Star Wars films and ideas.

Quran, Bible, Upanishads are like languages of written English or Japanese or verbal languages. They get passed down from people to people, the Mosque / Temple / Church / Synagogue are single-story venues, like a theater house with only a single play to share.

There is no supernatural. Who created English, who created French language? We all do together, working together, experiencing life... we create words for water / wawa, door, sleep, and even Thunder.

James Joyce is the one that created the language proofs around Romans 11:32 in his fiction storytelling to help us all see that peer pressure and popularity itself is what we *believe in*, but The Bible is still just a very popular best-selling fiction story.

Fighting over which language to speak and teach our children, which written language, which set of rituals and holidays, which story is the *one and only one perfect book* entirely misses the point of compassion and love teaching.

If they want every person in the world to be Muslim, why don’t they show themselves to be good Muslims first?”*
