# Recorded Society

Video and audio recording in society.

We have built the machines that can record audio and video.

And we have NOT address the toxic clergy.

1. 1988 publican of "Power of Myth" about the Great Seal USA and disqualified Levant faths should have been a constant topic of discussion since year 1988, and especially September 11, 2001 and even more so with the Christian Nationalism rise of hate from IRA and CA.

2. Media ecology lessons we have avoided. [The Gutenberg Galaxy 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy): "The miseries of conflict between the Eastern and Roman churches, for example, are a merely obvious instance of the type of opposition between the oral and the visual cultures, having nothing to do with the Faith" - Marshall McLuhan

What privacy are we hiding?

1. Affairs
2. child abuse
3. illegal drug purchases and distribution
