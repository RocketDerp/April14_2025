# Faith in Liberal vs. Conservative

Faith in education, teaching, learning, patience

“Patience does not mean to passively endure. It means to be farsighted enough to trust the end result of a process. What does patience mean? It means to look at the thorn and see the rose, to look at the night and see the dawn. Impatience means to be so shortsighted as to not be able to see the outcome. The lovers of God never run out of patience, for they know that time is needed for the crescent moon to become full.”
― Elif Shafak, The Forty Rules of Love

# Fiction vs. Nonfiction

By treating "conservative" and "right" / "right-wing" as valid, it is anti-education and anti-understanding and anti-comprehension endorsement. As if it is a sensible choice to believe in misunderstandings and to have comprehnsion mistakes.
