### 38% cheering + 60% booing = 98% engagement

&nbsp;

When dealing with Tony Clifton audiences, a population that boos and mocks and insults Tony Clifton still count as engagement.

38% + 60% = 98% audience engagement.

Donald Trump Tony Clifton success is measured by *Surkovian* Russian outcomes. Media addiction to total mockery. The sum of all people addicted to hate and dehumanization, 98% is how you measure the success of Kremlin techniques.

> No. He has a 38% approval rating. 60% disapproval.

When you are dealing with Tony Clifton performers on multiple stages with overlapping (live and rerun / repost) performances, you add together the 60% + 38% to get 98%. People mocking and insulting Tony Clifton are *engaged*, the Tony Clifton act isn't about goodness. The audience booing and ranting how dumb an idiot Tony Clifton performers are is all part of the the total audience capture.

For over 10 years, the entire USA population has been glued to their touch screens, caressing reaction comments to every move and shake of Donald Trump. The entire nation has gone to Hell. Media addiction is all that matters to every single person in the USA. A society so driven by attraction to trash Tony Clifton acting that the future has been wrecked. People are entirely in meme stupors, so addled by the never-ending mockery and name-calling. The entire world watches in horror as the United States of America has drowned itself in addiction to a Reality TV star they can't resist mimicking and mocking.
