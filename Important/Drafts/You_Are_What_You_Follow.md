In the United States of America, people follow the leadership of Donald J. Trump. What you follow and consume as information makes you into what you are. People who follow The Quran or Bible or Torah consider themselves entirely different people. You are the media you consume.

### When Everyone starts Following...

&nbsp;

When everyone starts following and adopting the attitudes and mindsets of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News...

When everyone starts following and adopting Internet Researh Agency and Cambridge Analytica conditoning...

When everyone ***avoids following*** Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan since October 8, 2013...

&nbsp;

### Past the places *you used to learn...*

Past the places you *used to follow and learn from*, the media you consumed.

Lyrics:    
"Somewhere, there's speaking, it's already coming in...   
Oh, and it's rising at the back of your mind!    
You never could get it unless you were fed it..   
Now you're here and you don't know why...   
But under skinned knees and the skid marks   
**Past the places where you used to learn**..."
