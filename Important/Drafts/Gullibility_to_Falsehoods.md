I thought people misunderstood autism - but after witnessing the past 18 months with Donald Trump in USA, I see the far deeper problem is everyday people think Donald Trump is honest, sincere, factual, accurate. The gullibility to falsehoods is huge crisis.

&nbsp;

I thought people were having trouble understanding climate science, earth sciences, how burning gasoline all over the Earth was warming up the earth with 8 billion people.

But now I see in USA that the problem is much more severe. People trust Donald Trump. People believe Donald Trump is accurate with information. No matter what Trump says, people believe it in USA.

USA society can't tell the most obviously incorrect and wrong person is not a good source of information. Gullibility in everyday American people is the problem. Everyday people in USA think Donald Trump is factual and correct. The gullible USA is hundreds of millions of people every day on every topic!

My use of English, my language, may seem unusual and broken to people

But my god, hundred of millions of people in United States of America think Donald Trump's language is excellent and trustworthy!  People are so gullible in USA that they believe and trust Donald Trump is accurate and factual. No wonder so many people with autism, autistic persons, are so bewildered.

When an entire society thinks Donald Trump at age 79 is accurate for information, what chance does a 23 year old person with #autism have? When everyone in USA society treats Donald Trump as hilarious and funny - something is very sick with EACH and EVERY PERSON in the world who isn't alarmed and disturbed that a liar is being trusted by everyone around them! 

Of all the people in the United States of America, people trust Donald Trump above all else for the future of their children. Gullibility of social media consumers is horrific and terrible! People trust RFK Jr too, it is out of control how gullible every person in USA has become.
