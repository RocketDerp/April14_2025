# Trumpism Recap

   1. Liberal vs. conservative has become meaningless in conversation. "Libtard this", "maggots that" (MAGA), "conservative tears", "liberal tears". There is nothing but hate an dehumanization. ToDo: link file in this folder on conservative

   2. Entertainment about MAGA is a trap. ../Important/January%20_8_2025_Entertainment_about_MAGA_is_a_trap.md

   3. Fiction vs. nonfiction. Nonfiction is not attractive.

   4. What the IRA and CA has done since year 2013 has now been fed into large language models / generative AI since year 2022. ChatGPT, Grok AI, etc.
