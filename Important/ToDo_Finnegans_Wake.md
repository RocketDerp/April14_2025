Joyce's books banned in USA, fart words.   
Vulgarity in James Joyce's works, particularly Ulysses, stems from his realistic portrayal of everyday life and sexuality, which included frank descriptions of bodily functions, sexual acts, and blasphemy.

Ok, so "James Joyce Experience" I had on Reddit and Lemmy ....   
So you do not need to be able to read Finnegans Wake. If you only ever learned oral English... the experience can be had by travel. Joyce did travel to Italy and France and experience other langauges, not just books.  When you see somoene reading Finnegans Wake and studying it, it is generally a slow experience. Alas, the REAL WORLD I expeirenced of living in Algeria (Afrida) with French and ARabic and very little English speakers for my wedding... was a living expeirence. My wife was fluent in English, better than me, but I brought to her American English, not the UK English she had learned (closer to Algeria? Focused more on UK?)... so she did not have much cultural knowledge about USA. So the weight of an entire contientn, my RV travels and livings in dozens of USA cities / experience, came to her who had never left her country. I lived the jolt of Finnegans Wake without slow-rading, through travel / relocation to Oran, Algeria. And then coparing us together in Amman, Jordan where it was English instead of French as the second-to-Arabis language. Which was my first time living in another English UK-influenced nation. "Arabic is the official language of Jordan, though English is widely used due to Jordan's history as a British protectorate from 1921 to 1946. English proficiency is mandatory in higher education". I have been in Canada a total of around 16 days in my life, but not rally lived there much, and only 3 days was I interacting with locals (VW user group meetiups I drove from Seattle in the 1990's). In Cyprus, I was alone, my wife was back in Algeria. Joyce is the bookworm way, as Joyce said, specifically about WRITTEN / READING: "Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why." - Letter to Fanny Guillermet (Zurich, 5 September 1918) - wher I have LIVED immersed with the FInnegans Wake experience in Chile, Algeria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia. Before the release of rael-time smartphone translators of written and verbal. Which, of course, James Joyce didn't have in his lifetime.

Men created those stories.  Hamlet's Ghost was created by men, Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghost" created by men. The 2,000 year old Levant "1 John 4:20" crisis of orgin and *seeing God* that is not there.

In the conclusion to his A Skeleton Key to Finnegan’s Wake, Campbell reflects on the experience of reading this book:


Like a millrace it sweeps down and out of sight, to strike again the paddle wheel of revolving time. As the dark torrent disappears from view, we are left standing on the bank, bewildered, yet strangely refreshed by the passage of these miraculous waters. (p. 355)

Phase 4 of Wake: Chaotic (Anarchic) Age: This is the final stage, where individualism and materialism lead to a breakdown of society. It is a period of chaos, selfishness, and sterility, often described as a "ricorso" or return to the primitive.

Exactly what Finnegans Wake does to minds. Runs ideas in iterations of lint like lint for compilers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software) 

"Campbell found consistent themes running through the text, noting that a "thread of logic runs through every paragraph" and that "in every passage there is a key word which sounds the essential theme". This approach to finding underlying patterns in complex narratives was one he applied to world mythology. He believed that Joyce provided "an answer to every riddle he propounds" within the text."

The context of this is that "God" is The Bible, Jesus / Levant book The Bible. John 1:1 verse 

It is not personal. People are misreading a schience fiction book and that problem is being ignored. Anti-God is anti science fiction leadership, especially terrible interpretations of The Bible that ignore "1 John 3:17" verse. This is morality-washing. A simulacra of resistance. The context of "God" as being www.GreatSealUSA.com is also being ignored.

JD Vance met the Pope in year 2025 with his power of the White House. Went to the funeral (IIRC). James Joyce's body of work from 1910's, 1920's 1930's is everything "Wake Woke" (Finnegan) wrong with JD Vance. He does not know the Hindu concepts in the Great Seal of the United States of America and grasp Romans 11:32 Bible verse and "1 John 4:20" themes of Joyce. Nor does he translate mythology to mythology on a world wide basis, Pale Blue Dot perspective.

Choice marriage honesty / rituals. Joseph Campbell talked about european women wearing hair up as signal. 

Transformations of Myth Through Time    
Paperback – February 28, 1990    
page 252   
( Page number sourced from "Myth and Ritual in Women's Detective Fiction", Christine A. Jackson, year 2015, page 41 )

"When Parzival comes back, Condwiramurs has put her hair up in the way of a married woman.  They're married.  This is marriage for love, the mind's love, the love of character, the love of quality, and they go to bed.  Well, he doesn't know anything, and she doesn't know much more, and so they just lie there.  As Wolfram says, "Not many a lady nowadays would have been satisfied with such a night."  And then there was the second night, and there was the third night, and then Parzival thought, "Oh, yes, mother told me."  So Wolfram says, "If you'll pardon me for letting you know, they interlaced arms and legs and thought, 'This is what we should have been doing all the time,' and the marriage was consummated."  No priest.  The answer:  marriage is the confirmation of love, and sexual love is the sacramentalization of marriage.  That's bringing the two terms together.

This is the first time it's been done, and this is actually the ideal of marriage in our world today - marriage for love.  This is the most difficult kind of marriage, because the whole basis of it is relationship, person to person, not to this function, that function, or another.

The point here is that it was not a marriage that began with physical sex; when she put her hair up, they were married.  Wolfram tells us that it starts in the spirit and is fulfilled in the flesh."
