Joyce's books banned in USA, fart words.   
Vulgarity in James Joyce's works, particularly Ulysses, stems from his realistic portrayal of everyday life and sexuality, which included frank descriptions of bodily functions, sexual acts, and blasphemy.

Ok, so "James Joyce Experience" I had on Reddit and Lemmy ....   
So you do not need to be able to read Finnegans Wake. If you only ever learned oral English... the experience can be had by travel. Joyce did travel to Italy and France and experience other langauges, not just books.  When you see somoene reading Finnegans Wake and studying it, it is generally a slow experience. Alas, the REAL WORLD I expeirenced of living in Algeria (Afrida) with French and ARabic and very little English speakers for my wedding... was a living expeirence. My wife was fluent in English, better than me, but I brought to her American English, not the UK English she had learned (closer to Algeria? Focused more on UK?)... so she did not have much cultural knowledge about USA. So the weight of an entire contientn, my RV travels and livings in dozens of USA cities / experience, came to her who had never left her country. I lived the jolt of Finnegans Wake without slow-rading, through travel / relocation to Oran, Algeria. And then coparing us together in Amman, Jordan where it was English instead of French as the second-to-Arabis language. Which was my first time living in another English UK-influenced nation. "Arabic is the official language of Jordan, though English is widely used due to Jordan's history as a British protectorate from 1921 to 1946. English proficiency is mandatory in higher education". I have been in Canada a total of around 16 days in my life, but not rally lived there much, and only 3 days was I interacting with locals (VW user group meetiups I drove from Seattle in the 1990's). In Cyprus, I was alone, my wife was back in Algeria. Joyce is the bookworm way, as Joyce said, specifically about WRITTEN / READING: "Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why." - Letter to Fanny Guillermet (Zurich, 5 September 1918) - wher I have LIVED immersed with the FInnegans Wake experience in Chile, Algeria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia. Before the release of rael-time smartphone translators of written and verbal. Which, of course, James Joyce didn't have in his lifetime.

Heart of James Joyce, Roman palace of the soul.   
Islamic (Ottoman), Roman (year 380 on), Israel - all claim outer-space allien Allah / Yaweh / Jesus messages saved humanity. Science fiction inspiration pointing in the wrong direction. Men created those stories.  Hamlet's Ghost was created by men, Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghost" created by men. The 2,000 year old Levant "1 John 4:20" crisis of orgin and *seeing God* that is not there. God is a symbol of world peace and everyone, not an entity. Not a space alien who sent people from planet Eden. That's sci fi.

In the conclusion to his A Skeleton Key to Finneganâ€™s Wake, Campbell reflects on the experience of reading this book:


Like a millrace it sweeps down and out of sight, to strike again the paddle wheel of revolving time. As the dark torrent disappears from view, we are left standing on the bank, bewildered, yet strangely refreshed by the passage of these miraculous waters. (p. 355)

Phase 4 of Wake: Chaotic (Anarchic) Age: This is the final stage, where individualism and materialism lead to a breakdown of society. It is a period of chaos, selfishness, and sterility, often described as a "ricorso" or return to the primitive.

Exactly what Finnegans Wake does to minds. Runs ideas in iterations of lint like lint for compilers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software) 

"Campbell found consistent themes running through the text, noting that a "thread of logic runs through every paragraph" and that "in every passage there is a key word which sounds the essential theme". This approach to finding underlying patterns in complex narratives was one he applied to world mythology. He believed that Joyce provided "an answer to every riddle he propounds" within the text."

The context of this is that "God" is The Bible, Jesus / Levant book The Bible. John 1:1 verse 

It is not personal. People are misreading a schience fiction book and that problem is being ignored. Anti-God is anti science fiction leadership, especially terrible interpretations of The Bible that ignore "1 John 3:17" verse. This is morality-washing. A simulacra of resistance. The context of "God" as being www.GreatSealUSA.com is also being ignored.

JD Vance met the Pope in year 2025 with his power of the White House. Went to the funeral (IIRC). James Joyce's body of work from 1910's, 1920's 1930's is everything "Wake Woke" (Finnegan) wrong with JD Vance. He does not know the Hindu concepts in the Great Seal of the United States of America and grasp Romans 11:32 Bible verse and "1 John 4:20" themes of Joyce. Nor does he translate mythology to mythology on a world wide basis, Pale Blue Dot perspective.

Core concern of Finnegans Wake - Romans 11:32 inversion, "1 John 4:20" inversion.
