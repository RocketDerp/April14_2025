Joyce's books banned in USA, fart words.   
Vulgarity in James Joyce's works, particularly Ulysses, stems from his realistic portrayal of everyday life and sexuality, which included frank descriptions of bodily functions, sexual acts, and blasphemy.

Ok, so "James Joyce Experience" I had on Reddit and Lemmy ....   
So you do not need to be able to read Finnegans Wake. If you only ever learned oral English... the experience can be had by travel. Joyce did travel to Italy and France and experience other langauges, not just books.  When you see somoene reading Finnegans Wake and studying it, it is generally a slow experience. Alas, the REAL WORLD I expeirenced of living in Algeria (Afrida) with French and ARabic and very little English speakers for my wedding... was a living expeirence. My wife was fluent in English, better than me, but I brought to her American English, not the UK English she had learned (closer to Algeria? Focused more on UK?)... so she did not have much cultural knowledge about USA. So the weight of an entire contientn, my RV travels and livings in dozens of USA cities / experience, came to her who had never left her country. I lived the jolt of Finnegans Wake without slow-rading, through travel / relocation to Oran, Algeria. And then coparing us together in Amman, Jordan where it was English instead of French as the second-to-Arabis language. Which was my first time living in another English UK-influenced nation. "Arabic is the official language of Jordan, though English is widely used due to Jordan's history as a British protectorate from 1921 to 1946. English proficiency is mandatory in higher education". I have been in Canada a total of around 16 days in my life, but not rally lived there much, and only 3 days was I interacting with locals (VW user group meetiups I drove from Seattle in the 1990's). In Cyprus, I was alone, my wife was back in Algeria. Joyce is the bookworm way, as Joyce said, specifically about WRITTEN / READING: "Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why." - Letter to Fanny Guillermet (Zurich, 5 September 1918) - wher I have LIVED immersed with the FInnegans Wake experience in Chile, Algeria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia. Before the release of rael-time smartphone translators of written and verbal. Which, of course, James Joyce didn't have in his lifetime.

In the conclusion to his A Skeleton Key to Finnegan’s Wake, Campbell reflects on the experience of reading this book:


Like a millrace it sweeps down and out of sight, to strike again the paddle wheel of revolving time. As the dark torrent disappears from view, we are left standing on the bank, bewildered, yet strangely refreshed by the passage of these miraculous waters. (p. 355)

Phase 4 of Wake: Chaotic (Anarchic) Age: This is the final stage, where individualism and materialism lead to a breakdown of society. It is a period of chaos, selfishness, and sterility, often described as a "ricorso" or return to the primitive.

Exactly what Finnegans Wake does to minds. Runs ideas in iterations of lint like lint for compilers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software) 

"Campbell found consistent themes running through the text, noting that a "thread of logic runs through every paragraph" and that "in every passage there is a key word which sounds the essential theme". This approach to finding underlying patterns in complex narratives was one he applied to world mythology. He believed that Joyce provided "an answer to every riddle he propounds" within the text."

JD Vance met the Pope in year 2025 with his power of the White House. Went to the funeral (IIRC). James Joyce's body of work from 1910's, 1920's 1930's is everything "Wake Woke" (Finnegan) wrong with JD Vance. He does not know the Hindu concepts in the Great Seal of the United States of America and grasp Romans 11:32 Bible verse and "1 John 4:20" themes of Joyce. Nor does he translate mythology to mythology on a world wide basis, Pale Blue Dot perspective.

Choice marriage honesty / rituals. Joseph Campbell talked about european women wearing hair up as signal. 

Transformations of Myth Through Time    
Paperback – February 28, 1990    
page 252   
( Page number sourced from "Myth and Ritual in Women's Detective Fiction", Christine A. Jackson, year 2015, page 41 )

"When Parzival comes back, Condwiramurs has put her hair up in the way of a married woman.  They're married.  This is marriage for love, the mind's love, the love of character, the love of quality, and they go to bed.  Well, he doesn't know anything, and she doesn't know much more, and so they just lie there.  As Wolfram says, "Not many a lady nowadays would have been satisfied with such a night."  And then there was the second night, and there was the third night, and then Parzival thought, "Oh, yes, mother told me."  So Wolfram says, "If you'll pardon me for letting you know, they interlaced arms and legs and thought, 'This is what we should have been doing all the time,' and the marriage was consummated."  No priest.  The answer:  marriage is the confirmation of love, and sexual love is the sacramentalization of marriage.  That's bringing the two terms together.

This is the first time it's been done, and this is actually the ideal of marriage in our world today - marriage for love.  This is the most difficult kind of marriage, because the whole basis of it is relationship, person to person, not to this function, that function, or another.

The point here is that it was not a marriage that began with physical sex; when she put her hair up, they were married.  Wolfram tells us that it starts in the spirit and is fulfilled in the flesh."

Campbell ou Joyce: "was that same number again, 1132, right out of the Good Book! Joyce had taken that paradox of the Christian faith as the motto of the greatest masterwork of his life. And there he describes ruthlessly the depths of the private and public monstrosities of human life and action in the utterly sinful course of human history. It’s all there—told with love."

Choice marriage family honesty to everyone. "Death by Father" (God strikes you down, Father above metaphors, Finnegans Wake ladder height to Tim) - Suicide by father / suicide by cop. Tortured artist. The opening of Howard Blooms August 2000 book talks about nurses neglecting patients who don't socialize.

"Humans are apparently the same. Investigations have revealed that the hospital **patients who need help the most — those submerged in depression — are the least likely to receive their doctors’ and nurses’ tender, loving attention**. Careful scrutiny indicates that the sufferers are unwittingly triggering their own rejection. **Depressed patients whine, snarl, or turn their faces to the wall** 21 in ways that alienate their doctors and nurses. They upset their caregivers through every means from facial expression and verbal intonation to body language. 22 An individual selectionist would explain that such self-damaging behavior must be the result of an adaptive response—one with a hidden benefit. The patient’s death might boost the genetic success of close relatives by relieving them of a burden or by enriching them with insurance and bequests. In addition, by subtly doing themselves in the patients might benefit friends who could return the favor to their family someday."

Anti-accent, enforcers of who is accepted, Tower of Babel of humanity making language variations. "Just as he does with the “vacuum”, McLuhan takes “abcedmindedness” in two different ways, one seemingly only negative, reflecting literal (ABC…) thought, the other a difficult positive, enabling complex insight into “the gestures of being itself”.  But where he treats the “vacuum” first in negative (empty) fashion, then in positive (replete), here the order is reversed to treat “abcedmindedness” first in its positive aspect (“to be abced-minded is to be part of the dream of history that is Finnegans Wake“), then in its negative one (“just alphabetically controlled”)." https://mcluhansnewsciences.com/mcluhan/2016/10/abcedmindedness/ anti-diversity.

* the word "crawsake," which is a pun on "Christ's sake" and may allude to the animal, appears in Book I, Chapter 1, in the following passage: "So pool the begg and pass the kish for crawsake. Omen. So sigh us. Grampupus is fallen down but grinny sprids the boord. Whase on the joint of a desh? Finfoefom the Fush"

* "River Liffey (Anna Livia Plurabelle): The river is personified as ALP, and crawfish live in rivers, so they're natural inhabitants of her watery domain in Dublin."

* "Backwards Motion: Crawfish often move backward, a key theme in the Wake, where history repeats and language flows in reverse (e.g., "riverleafy" for Liffey)."

* https://clanecommunity.ie/wild-about-clane/aquatic-life/white-clawed-crayfish/ "River Liffey at Clane. Our stretch of the river is also home to a remarkable lobster-like animal: the White-Clawed Crayfish."

* Mud bugs, craw fish / cray fish / etc, all the English words for these fresh-water recirculating creatures. Very Joyce to word-shift. 

* The water quality upstream of Dublin toxins is better, that is why they are rare in Dublin with all the pollution. Austropotamobius pallipes. "The section of the River Liffey in central Dublin, near locations like the Adam and Eve's Church on Merchant's Quay, is less likely to support crayfish populations due to historical water quality issues and other urban factors." church-goers poison Eden near Adam and Eve's

* "Crayfish Plague: The native populations are under significant threat from crayfish plague, which has caused mass mortality events in other Irish river catchments (e.g., the River Blackwater and River Nore). Strict biosecurity measures are in place to prevent its spread."

* "It is illegal to introduce any non-native species of crayfish to Ireland, and anyone intending to work with the native species requires a license from the National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS)."

* "The "mamafesta" letter, a central element of the narrative (Book I, Chapter 5), is famously uncovered from a mound of mud by a hen scratching at the ground. This letter, written by ALP to defend her husband, is described as being stained and having "accretions of terricious matter" (earthy material)." (Mud bugs, mud hills, mud creatures)

* "ALP attempting to wash away the "dirt" or guilt of her husband's rumored scandal. The water of the Liffey is frequently described as "brown and dirty," reflecting the real river's appearance and the debris of history it carries."

* "The main character, HCE (Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker), is associated with an earwig (a type of bug) through a pun on his name and the German word for earwig, Ohrwurm."

* "Biblical Allusion: Joyce incorporated a legend that "Cain got the idea of burial from watching an earwig beside his dead brother Abel". This links the insect to themes of guilt, original sin, and the cycle of life and death central to the book's plot."

* "she recalled that a Yorkshire name for earwig is 'twitchbell'. 'Will you give me that?' said Joyce, much pleased. He remarked that an old legend recounted that Cain got the idea of burial from watching an earwig beside his dead brother Abel." - https://peterchrisp.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-earwicker-graves-in-sidlesham.html
    * ""Twitchbell" isn't a single common term but can refer to a specific fly-fishing lure, a historical/dialect word for a small bell or clockwork sound, or even the title of a fantasy book, with its meaning depending heavily on context, but in modern digital life, it's likely associated with sound alerts for Twitch streams."

"Power of Myth" 1988 book that George Lucas filmed:    

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I’d begin with the troubadours in the twelfth century.

BILL MOYERS: And who were they?

CAMPBELL: The troubadours were the nobility of Provence and then later other parts of France and Europe. **In Germany they’re known as the Minnesingers, the singers of love. Minne** is the medieval German word for love.

MOYERS: Were they the poets of their age?

...

CAMPBELL: The tests that were given then involved, for example, sending a chap out to guard a bridge. The traffic in the Middle Ages was somewhat encumbered by these youths guarding bridges. But also the tests included going into battle. A woman who was too ruthless in asking her lover to risk real death before she would acquiesce in anything was considered sauvage or “savage.” Also, the woman who gave herself without the testing was “savage.” There was a very nice psychological estimation game going on here.

MOYERS: The troubadours weren’t aiming, were they, to dissolve marriages or the world, nor was their aim carnal intercourse, lust, or even the quenching of the soul of God. You write, “Rather, they celebrated life directly in the experience of love as a refining, sublimating force, opening the heart to the sad bittersweet melody of being through love, one’s own anguish and one’s own joy.” They weren’t trying to destroy things, were they?

CAMPBELL: No, you see, that motive of power was not what was in them. It was the motive of personal experience and sublimation. It’s quite different. There was no direct attack on the Church. The idea was to sublimate life into a spiritual plane of experiences.

MOYERS: Love is right in front of me. Amor is the path directly before me, the eyes—

CAMPBELL: —the meeting of the eyes, that idea. “So through the eyes love attains the heart: / For the eyes are the scouts of the heart.”

MOYERS: What was it that the troubadours learned about the psyche? We’ve heard about the psyche—Eros loved Psyche—and we’re told in our day that you must understand your psyche. What did the troubadours discover about the human psyche?

CAMPBELL: What they discovered was a certain individual aspect of it that cannot be talked about in purely general terms. The individual experience, the individual commitment to experience, the individual believing in his experience and living it—that is the main point here.

MOYERS: So love is not love in general, it is love for that woman?

CAMPBELL: For that one woman. That’s right.
