Joyce's books banned in USA, fart words.   
Vulgarity in James Joyce's works, particularly Ulysses, stems from his realistic portrayal of everyday life and sexuality, which included frank descriptions of bodily functions, sexual acts, and blasphemy.

Ok, so "James Joyce Experience" I had on Reddit and Lemmy ....   
So you do not need to be able to read Finnegans Wake. If you only ever learned oral English... the experience can be had by travel. Joyce did travel to Italy and France and experience other langauges, not just books.  When you see somoene reading Finnegans Wake and studying it, it is generally a slow experience. Alas, the REAL WORLD I expeirenced of living in Algeria (Afrida) with French and ARabic and very little English speakers for my wedding... was a living expeirence. My wife was fluent in English, better than me, but I brought to her American English, not the UK English she had learned (closer to Algeria? Focused more on UK?)... so she did not have much cultural knowledge about USA. So the weight of an entire contientn, my RV travels and livings in dozens of USA cities / experience, came to her who had never left her country. I lived the jolt of Finnegans Wake without slow-rading, through travel / relocation to Oran, Algeria. And then coparing us together in Amman, Jordan where it was English instead of French as the second-to-Arabis language. Which was my first time living in another English UK-influenced nation. "Arabic is the official language of Jordan, though English is widely used due to Jordan's history as a British protectorate from 1921 to 1946. English proficiency is mandatory in higher education". I have been in Canada a total of around 16 days in my life, but not rally lived there much, and only 3 days was I interacting with locals (VW user group meetiups I drove from Seattle in the 1990's). In Cyprus, I was alone, my wife was back in Algeria. Joyce is the bookworm way, as Joyce said, specifically about WRITTEN / READING: "Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why." - Letter to Fanny Guillermet (Zurich, 5 September 1918) - wher I have LIVED immersed with the FInnegans Wake experience in Chile, Algeria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia. Before the release of rael-time smartphone translators of written and verbal. Which, of course, James Joyce didn't have in his lifetime.

With the rumors of HCE, what's the point of divorce if you believe in forgiveness?
Choice marriage honesty. Also I expect these numbers are not true for every time period of the past 250 years broken down by decade. Nor do I expect they are true in the current decade in all nation of the world. A film I STRONLGY recommend is "A Seperation", which I saw in the cine in downtown Austin year 2012 because of Roger Ebert's review https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-separation-2012 .
