## ToDo Lessons

1. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" should be core understanding of what we overlooked / avoided. A society can not focus on everything, a topic Neil Postman described will in his later 1992 book on technology and information systems. But it is helpful to create a narative, as Postman describes in his later-yet September 1995 book on education.

2. We The USA just didn't take information warfare seriously enough.

3. "Former President Obama on Thursday said he still holds regrets for failing to see the rampant spread of disinformation within the US while he was president." - https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3459415-obama-says-he-has-regrets-surrounding-disinformation-in-2016-election/

4. The WHY didn't we see it coming is the explosion of entertainment. *out of left field* Reality TV stars took over. Neil Postamn's 1985 book "Amsuing Ourselves To Death" blames the technology itself. We need to focus on that. It was an oversight in our teachings and not enough people had a grasp of the earthquake of social media and 5G mobile network media under our feet, the touchscreen devices shifting our reality. Neil Postman's 1985 book grounds us at a point in time of another Entertainment-based President second term, 1985.

5. Rick Roderick 1993 backs up Postman from an entirely differernt angle. Again, please get on the same page of what slammed our nation that we didn't see coming. https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

6.  Ths ToDo List is all about GETTING ON THE SAME PAGE of what the fuck hit us and why we all went mass psychosis and crazy.  Study this, get on the same page too:  "MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M
