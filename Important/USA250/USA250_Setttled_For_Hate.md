# Information Overload

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. **It is only now (1992) beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

# Information Overload Active Measures, Strategy

What Neil Postman was describing in year 1992 was mostly accidental. Machines / hardware advances. It was new. Like automobiles being new and an absence of gasoline / petrol refill stations.

Then it became recognized. Exploited, manipulated, the central concern. Once all the rural population had admiration for an Apple iPhone and Apple iPad in hand, around year 2012.

Confusing people and stunning people became organized and weaponized.

* "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are **unspoken and the even unconscious** -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to **drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else** to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."
