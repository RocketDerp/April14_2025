# USA250 Settled For Hate

Settled for, as in a romantic relationship "Settled for Marriage" with someone that wasn't really the dream. Settled for a job that paid the bills but isn't want a person wants to be doing.

Settled for Fox News NFL sports-inspired anti-comprehension.

# Information Overload

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. **It is only now (1992) beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

# Information Overload Active Measures, Strategy

What Neil Postman was describing in year 1992 was mostly accidental. Machines / hardware advances. It was new. Like automobiles being new and an absence of gasoline / petrol refill stations.

Then it became recognized. Exploited, manipulated, the central concern. Once all the rural population had admiration for an Apple iPhone and Apple iPad in hand, around year 2012.

Confusing people and stunning people became organized and weaponized.

* "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are **unspoken and the even unconscious** -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to **drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else** to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

# Sort of Hate vs. Hate

So now it becomes "choose your own reality", "choose your own adventure" knowledge screen game.

As Neil Postman said 1992 above on this page. Glut of information. Now it has been exploited by billionaires against the rural population and everyone interacting peer to peer.

ToDo: the history of peer to peer blocking on Reddit and concealing profile history. Timeline. Choose your own subreddits and block out human persons with different understandings.

What everyone wants to skip before 1992 Neil Postman is February 28, 1954 MLK Jr.

People PRIZE conflicts, competition, sports, "winning" with hate. Levant out-group religion vs. religion, sconce fiction vs. science fiction, storytelling hate.

World War Two Christian science fiction vs. Jewish science fiction. Hate vs. hate, hate for hate, *hate harder*. Not what Christians were told at all. 

After World War Two, in Atlanta where the war did not wreck as many lives. Some thinking and realization of TWO world wars of Christian Germans "hate thy neighbor". And Japan bombing Perl Harbor, hate all around.

Really rushed this, writing this is incredibly painful and hard. Because people prize and cheer on hate so much in December 2025.
