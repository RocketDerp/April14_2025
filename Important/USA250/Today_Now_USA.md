I think what happened in our mythology is that the symbols, the mythological archetypal symbols, became interpreted as facts. I think it starts with the Old Testament.
I think with the Old Testament, God is a fact, not a symbol!
And the holy land is *that* place, **and no other**. And Man is superior to the beasts. And nature is fallen. With the Fall in the Garden of Eden, nature is corrupt. So, we do not give ourselves to nature, we will correct nature. There is good and evil in nature, and we are supposed to be on the side of the good. There is a tension, you don't yield to nature.

What else have you got to worship? Some figment of your imagination you have put up in the clouds?
We need the symbols.

I think it starts with the Old Testament. I think with the Old Testament, 'God' is a fact, not a symbol. And the 'Holy Land' is 'that place', and no other. And

"So we do not give ourselves to Nature. We will correct Nature. There is 'good' and 'evil' in Nature, and we are supposed to be on the side of the good"

Joseph Campbell said.. this is the mythology of the goddess The Goddess in woman as the initiator, opening the eye of inner vision , vision that goes past the veil that is spread before us by the vision of the two eyes. Opening the ear to the music of the spheres. Opening consciousnes to a trans-personal realm of experience. The opening of the wisdom body to the voice of the wisdom of nature and the world round about. That serpent in the garden he knew where he was. He was an old, old deity who was the consort of the goddess and Eve was that consort. The serpent and eve make a better pair than Eve and Adam. The serpent and Eve were at the Tree of Bliss. Adam and Eve are out there having a tough time. Terrible tradition, a degradration and denial of NATURE. And serpent cursed and woman along with it. In our religion of the West which is based on an idea of a fallen nature, a good nature into which a negative power has infused evil, we have the idea of a conflict between good and evil. And so we are invited to stand for the good against the evil. And we do not have a religion like almost everybody else of the world, putting yourself in accord with nature. I think what happened in our mythology is that the symbols, the mythological archetypal symbols, became interpreted as facts. I think it starts with the Old Testament. I think with the Old Testament God is a fact, not a symbol. And the Holy Land is that place, and no other. And man is superior to their beasts and nature is fallen. With the fall in the Garden of Eden,  nature is corrupt. So we do not give ourselves to nature. We will correct nature. There is GOOD and EVIL in nature. And we are supposed to be on the side of the good. So there is a tension. You don't yield to nature. What else do you have to worship? Some figment of your imagination that you've put up in the clouds. And so we have lost the symbols. Meanwhile,  we need the symbols. And they come up in disturbed dreams and nightmares and so forth,  which are dealt with by the psychiatrists. #nature #josephcampbell #mythos #artislife

Ok, the clip;
