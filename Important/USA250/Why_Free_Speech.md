# Why Free Speech

So many people promote "free speech", but there is no education or learning about why.

John 1:1 of Europe.

## Echo chambers are not new

The church and the newspaper were the local echo chambers of the town.

## We had Marshall McLuhan

Like Joseph Campbell, we had Marshall McLuhan.

ToDo: Stephan A H lecture from 1987 talks about Campbell being an academic who interfaced with the public in his books and Cooper Union public lectures (even someon NYC public radio https://www.wnyc.org/story/dr-joseph-campbell-inward-journey-schizophrenia-and-mythology/ )

McLuhan met with John Lenno and Yoko. McLuhan went on TV. He educated the adult public, people who had already exicted school systems!

That was KEY! That ahs disappeared now.

We went full social media society in 2005, and the Apple iPhone mid 2007, and we had no Marshall McLuhan in public preparing us like we had with television.

That's the point of The Great Seal. That is the tragedy of our not teaching media ecology, including the langauge of the art symbols in the great seal. The pyramid, the plants growing on front, the seasonal river flow changes, the 13 steps of thinking, the age 21 threshold. That 13 is lucky meaning, not unlucky.

John 1:1 is the Eye, we can coin langauge, we can coin media systems.

The Church is the John 1:1 echo chamber

The office / job is the echo chamber

Online ones can be picked, distance. But John 1:1 echo chambers, Church, were neworked in USA.

## Free speech without Mcluhan

Cults. Cults form. John 1:1 cults.

And we have not faced up to art and langauge cults, emdia cults
