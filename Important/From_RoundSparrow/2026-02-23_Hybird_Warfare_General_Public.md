# Scattered, Fragmented, Brain Damage abounds

Scattered mindsets. Fragmented thinking. Brain damage abounds.

I personally have "hyper empathy" and the hybrid warfare since year 2013 has caused me extreme distress. "Hyper-empathy refers to a person having heightened empathy. Reasons and experiences of hyper-empathy vary. Some autistic people have reported experiencing hyper-empathy. In psychopathology, hyper-empathy is viewed as a symptom of a neurological disorder." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-empathy

"The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own." - University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called *disinformation*. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information — misplaced, **irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information — information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” - New York University's Neil Postman. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neil_Postman ...

# My Message Assertion, Payload

From Stephen Alfred Gutknecht

This is my assertion. This is my payload of my message. The reason I am contacting you today. 2026-02-23

In regard to the general public, what Marshall McLuhan called "being mass man", there is an alarming pattern of avoidance of serious nonfiction topics. (reference McLuhan year 1977 https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus ) Please excuse the following use of YouTube links, but I believe the time-frame of the first public reading of a highly relevant book is essential focus for everyone world wide.

1. https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxGLMkhbMgSwzWeQK7xYIBJ-nxn_UlzOdZ video December 5, 2014. "would go on to call the Fifth World War. The first nonlinear war of all against all. Which is a description by Vladislav Surkov, who sort of the ennui ??? of Russian politics, of the current (year 2014) war around Ukraine. um, so, I started working in Russian TV"
   * ASSERTION: The general public this week (February 23) is discussing Ukraine in the press stating Russia has started the "third world war". Instead, why are people in press and social computing not using this year 2014 video clip to call it what Surkov himself calls it, "the 5th world war". "War of All against All". A social media / press / "The Media" / global fiction-storytelling brainwashing war. Media ecology warfare. Hybrid warfare of messaging and information systems, news! Propaganda.

2. https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxsPMnrK_RCklBbjHHrPqdSuMi23zhsX_M "When I say Russia has no strategy, um. It has clearly several priorities. One is to turn the E.U. to mush. To humiliate the U.S. by showing Article 5 is a joke. Showing the world that NATO is a joke. These are all things... I don't think they add up to a strategy. They end up... sort of checklist of stuff they want to achieve. Sort of a strategy in the sense of.. this is where we want the country to be in 20 years time." - December 5, 2014
   * ASSERTION: The general public does not grasp that "into a joke" is hybrid warfare. That having the general public constantly joking and mocking about NATO and USA was described in December 2014 about Russia's agenda for the next 20 years.

3. Look closely at the August 24, 2018 https://www.BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 BBC story: "It examined thousands of tweets sent **between 2014 and 2017**. Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a "wedge issue", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University." ... **year 2014** evidence. "David Broniatowski from George Washington University."
   * ASSERTION: The United States of America abandonment of the World Health Organization. President Trump on January 20, 2025, announced the U.S. plan to leave the WHO. The spread of measles in USA is worsening. Why are people in the general population not associating this with documented hybrid warfare campaigns?

Thank you for your time and attention.

# Scraps of words, Piles of words

"Social media is the tool available to change the mind-set of masses. Hybrid war is an all-encompassing war which affects every aspect of the human society, to create panic which can only be achieved when the mind of the masses are targeted. Social media has the greatest potential in this regard. This medium can bring benefits out of proportion if utilized constructively. True and fair social media campaign provided at the appropriate time can change the mind-set of targeted audience and extend own point of view." https://Vocal.Media/journal/hybrid-warfare-vu2f08ow 
* ASSERTION: **the inverse of this has proven far more true and popular**. And it is a major assertion of mine to constantly emphasize FICTION_OUTSELLS_NONFICTION - the monomyth patterns of science fiction leadership throughout history (as defined by James Joyce on page 581 of his year 1939 fiction book Finnegans Wake).
