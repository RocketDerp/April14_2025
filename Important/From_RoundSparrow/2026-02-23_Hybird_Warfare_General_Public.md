# Scattered, Fragmented, Brain Damage abounds

Scattered mindsets. Fragmented thinking. Brain damage abounds.

I personally have "hyper empathy" and the hybrid warfare since year 2013 has caused me extreme distress. "Hyper-empathy refers to a person having heightened empathy. Reasons and experiences of hyper-empathy vary. Some autistic people have reported experiencing hyper-empathy. In psychopathology, hyper-empathy is viewed as a symptom of a neurological disorder." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-empathy

"The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own." - University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called *disinformation*. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information — misplaced, **irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information — information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” - New York University's Neil Postman. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neil_Postman ...

# Scraps of words, Piles of words

"Social media is the tool available to change the mind-set of masses. Hybrid war is an all-encompassing war which affects every aspect of the human society, to create panic which can only be achieved when the mind of the masses are targeted. Social media has the greatest potential in this regard. This medium can bring benefits out of proportion if utilized constructively. True and fair social media campaign provided at the appropriate time can change the mind-set of targeted audience and extend own point of view." https://Vocal.Media/journal/hybrid-warfare-vu2f08ow - **the inverse of this has proven far more true and popular**. And it is a major assertion of mine to constantly empahsize FICTION_OUTSELLS_NONFICTION - the monomyth patterns of science fiction leadership throughout history (as defined by James Joyce on page 581 of his fiction book Finnegans Wake).
