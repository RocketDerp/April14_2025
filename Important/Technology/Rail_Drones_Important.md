Why are drones not being developed for USA railroad usage? To go 4 to 5 minutes ahead of trains and video feed and trigger crossing warnings? University contests to develop open source #rail drones?

Gives time for the train to slow down and prevent crashes or encountering damaged or iced/snow on tracks. The smallish drones could even slow down and wait before crossings and then speed back up when given an all-clear from humans.

Even before computers, this could have been a manned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road%E2%80%93rail_vehicle #RoadRail #RoadRailVehicle  

People with radios tied to a dead-man switch could have been possible since year 1950 and earlier. An automobile / car that goes ahead of the train and can speed up and slow down and even exit the track in an emergency. 

Rail Drones that go 4 to 5 minutes AHEAD of the train could also broadcast a #WiFi #SSID signal that automobile computers and smartphones could detect - or an F.M. radio signal or A.M. radio signal / etc to notify that a train is approaching to pedestrians /etc
