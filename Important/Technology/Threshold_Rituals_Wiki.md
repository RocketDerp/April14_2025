Will scroll off as RFK Jr entertains people with autism attacking and pro-disease spreading, driven by raging media addiction to antics politics, deception leaders. People who prize deception leaders like Trump as the center of attention so they can brag and ego declare they are smarter than POTUS status symbol. https://bsky.app/profile/roundsparrow.bsky.social/post/3m76cpoudpc2v

# 1987 Situation

As of year 1987

CAMPBELL: No, but in our life we don’t have anything like that. You can have a **man forty-five years old still trying to be obedient to his father**. So he goes to a psychoanalyst, who does the job for him.

BILL MOYERS: Or he goes to the movies.

CAMPBELL: That might be our counterpart to mythological re-enactments — except that we don’t have the **same kind of thinking** going into the production of a movie that goes into the production of an initiation ritual.

MOYERS: No, but given the absence of initiation rituals, which have largely disappeared from our society, the world of imagination as projected on that screen serves, even if in a faulty way, to tell that story, doesn’t it?

CAMPBELL: Yes, but what is unfortunate for us is that a lot of the people who **write these stories do not have the sense of their responsibility**. These stories are making and breaking lives. But the movies are made simply to make money. The kind of responsibility that goes into a priesthood with a ritual is not there. That is one of our problems today.
