# Always Public Sensor Data Broadcast

TOPIC:

The incentive that local people have to monitor and mind the business of nearby dangers.

Electrical voltage sags / local grid heat sensors / voltage sensors. Again, PUBLIC dilligance of monitoring and self-interest of knowing.

Sewer explosions. Building heating system boilers and steam lines. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_New_York_City_steam_explosion

Hazerous truck materials driving into area, the support cars that go with such convoys.

Yet get the idea. The PROXIMITY. 

A WiFi channel system / antenna direction system - for nearby monitoring of sensors for smoke, temperature, humidity, etc.

That it is in the PUBLIC INTEREST to have this data ALWAYS sent.

By ALWAYS sending the data, even routine data, people can see if the sensors are within normal parameters for the year and such, That they aren't dead or broken. And ot have to cout on som idle device "waking up" like a smoke alarm that may blow as soon as the alarm is sounded. A keep-alive carrier. (Humor of Homer developing this: https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Everything%27s_Okay_Alarm)


# Protocol or shutdown of signal

A signal that can be sent out that there will be a brief intrruption and the expected return to service. Or signal to redirect to another technology or signal source channel.

Even a backup / emergency -use device (thaht fire departments / fire trucks could have / or cell towers have) could provide this function if the permanent source is destroyed.

# Objectives: cost

Leverage existing smartphone / hobby hardware protocols like WiFi that can be leveraged quickly and flexibly with many software apps to monitor and let user decide how to mind the signals.
