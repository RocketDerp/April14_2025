Democrats / Democratic party members (We The People) have extreme survivorship bias.
The [Internet Research Agency has stolen hearts and minds to worship](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america) Trump / Putin pairing since March 2013. The Survivors of the IRA meme warfare do not rescue or teach cult deprogramming. Survivor bias.

I have expressed this in patterns of:   
"not just MAGA"   
"not just conservatives"   
"not just Republicans"   
"not just Fox News HDTV audience"   

Media ecology, filter-bubble behaviors, out-group hate behaviors. The bragging "I am better than MAGA" of the popular "leopards eating faces, ha ha ha laugh laugh laugh" is a reactionary mindset to "liberal tears".

Survivorship

It is kind of why Dante created levels of hell. It's all bad, all hell, and competing for a level of hell is a terrible competition. Tower of Babel climb, deal with the John 1:1, back to top of this page with the James Joyce language confrontations.

* "Being illiterate in the processes of any medium (language) leaves one at the mercy of those who control it. The new media — these new languages — then are among the most important "subjects" to be studied in the interests of survival." - Neil Postman on media ecology
