Before *The Fall*... when they wrote it on The Wall...      

* "primarily refers to the Hole-in-the-Wall pub in Dublin's Phoenix Park, symbolizing barriers, entrances/exits, history (like Stonehenge), and the constant cycles of enclosure and release (the fall of Finnegan/HCE). It connects to the novel's central themes of confinement (the wall keeping people in/out), access (the turnstile), and the "offwall" or "omphalos" (center) of history and Dublin life, representing both literal structure and mythical space." - Google Search Summary 2025-12-18 morning USA
