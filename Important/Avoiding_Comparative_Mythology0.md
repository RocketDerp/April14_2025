# Avoiding Comparative Mythology

I think elsewhere in this set of files I have written about travel and MLK Jr's 1954 equation. That technology advanceement of communications and tarsportation systsems changes perspective on how you interpret your own society. Airports and telephone systems spanning the world. The ability to take photographs and share them across the world via various delivery systems.

The issues of fiction domination of mythology over socities wasn't really clear to most people until the time period James Joyce was writing. Year 1924 for Finnegans Wake.

By year 1954, MLK Jr saw the problem of hate.

Fox News and other Repert Murdoch media outlets show patterns of fiction attraction. Hate attraction in the audience. Social media systems the same.
