That's the topic I am circeling around with this GitHub project. That's the impossible to speak, beyond words.

## Always wrong, always unpopular

MOYERS: What has undercut this experience today?

CAMPBELL: It’s characteristic of democracy that majority rule is understood as being effective not only in politics but also in thinking. In thinking, of course, the majority is always wrong.

MOYERS: Always wrong?

CAMPBELL: In matters of this kind, yes. The majority’s function in relation to the spirit is to try to listen and to open up to someone who’s had an experience beyond that of food, shelter, progeny, and wealth.

We understood "Stand up for the LITTLE GUY" before. Matthew 25:40 Bible verse.

Popularity itself is toxic since year 2013. I articulte this as contantly nane-drop of: Surkov, Internet Research Agency, IRA, Cambrige Analytic, CA, information warfarfare.

Ultimatly it is manipulation of popularity to toxic.

That means Malala. Malala was self-aware she was giving voices to the non-popular, unpopular. 

ALWAYS wrong: “We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban

THE LEAST OF THESE is SILENT on a CRTICAL TOPIC: “When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban

### Self-aware: "I raise up my voice—not so I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard"

Matthew 25:40 Bible verse.

Climate change denial    
Matthew 25:40 Bible verse.   

The plants, the animals, the poor without cars and private jets... that's the least. Not just human life, but all species on earth. We need to slow down. We need to organize sharing rids - not for profit, but for climate change and ecology. We need to educate on pregnancy and sustainability. We need to trade people around, we need to face up to the technology boom humanity created. 

Like all my writing, this needs massive rewriting.

USA population needs to stop being self-centered and spread education. Wiki values. Not MAGA Russian IRA values.

We ignored MLK Jr. February 28, 1954. Hate has got to go. We reached a technological realization of world war, and we all need to sober up from tech addiction and face the egoism and hate problems.

## January 6, 2021 

Cambridge Analytica, marketing / advertising / media addiction / selling / the thrill of "grand opening" selling, we are pushing ourselvs into badness. We are burning out goodness. Burnout abounds.

USA needs to face up to age 250 problems. MLK Jr February 28, 1954 left behind.

Yes, I'm beyond sick of writing this and seeing these anti-goodness paths and patterns. If we don't wake up to Finengans Wake year 1924 patterns of media ecology, we are going to drive ourselves into far warse than Sawt Valley Pakistan imported Quran interpreetation issues.
