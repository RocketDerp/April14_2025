That's the topic I am circeling around with this GitHub project. That's the impossible to speak, beyond words.

## Always wrong, always unpopular

MOYERS: What has undercut this experience today?

CAMPBELL: It’s characteristic of democracy that majority rule is understood as being effective not only in politics but also in thinking. In thinking, of course, the majority is always wrong.

MOYERS: Always wrong?

CAMPBELL: In matters of this kind, yes. The majority’s function in relation to the spirit is to try to listen and to open up to someone who’s had an experience beyond that of food, shelter, progeny, and wealth.

We understood "Stand up for the LITTLE GUY" before. Matthew 25:40 Bible verse.

Popularity itself is toxic since year 2013. I articulte this as contantly nane-drop of: Surkov, Internet Research Agency, IRA, Cambrige Analytic, CA, information warfarfare.

Ultimatly it is manipulation of popularity to toxic.

That means Malala. Malala was self-aware she was giving voices to the non-popular, unpopular. 

ALWAYS wrong: “We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced.”

THE LEAST OF THESE is SILENT on a CRTICAL TOPIC: “When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban

### Self-aware: "I raise up my voice—not so I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard"

Matthew 25:40 Bible verse.
