People do not understand: It is the opening words of the image, not understanding.

Look at the trends:

1. entertainers and sports stars, their wealth. Baseball players, basketball players, NFL football players. Famous musicians. Copyright holders.

2. How many stand up and say : 1 million a year is enough for me, I want to take the excess and give away the songs and art for free, or pay my employess / helpers / assistants better.

That's what you have to understand.

I didn't understand it. Until I worked at Paul Allen Group in Bellevue Washngton on the team to help purchase the Seattle Seahawks. App empire of software, NBA empire, NFL empire, ESPN ties to Starwave, hollywood film (Dreamworks), entertainment for the rich and famous on private fleet of cruise ships and private jets, private space travel. 1997, 1998, 1999.

It was what lead me to predicting the Arab Spring. 

Media ecology.

The rich are not the ones doing it. It is the audience. It is the sports fans.

I grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana - graduated high school at a sports-loving Snider High in 1988.

And December 11, 1987 it was spelled out to me.

getting too drunk on Saturdays
(Check it out) playing football with the kids on Sundays
(Check it out) soaring with the eagles all week long
And this is all that we've learned about living
This is all that we've learned about living

It wasn't until 1998 ... Halloween Documents ... and the sports team owner analysis that I saw. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents

that I started to see the audience prizes icons and symbols. Like the Levant.

People love blood-soaked "Holy Lands" and symbols. WE THE PEOPLE.
