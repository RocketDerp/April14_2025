# Health Care Knowledge Junked

USA society by not focusing on Wiki style sharing of the best refined medical information.... and instead focused on secrets / trade practice / high priced closed-admission schools for brand-name degrees...

blah blah, how does one desxribe such systemic dehumanization? The weight of so many people who want to watch other people be sick and suffering so they can have the goism of a better life. "Better choices" competition.

Reddit audience for over a year cheering on Luigi murder for gun worship... but repeating and staying focused on consistely asserting "Second Bill of Rights January 1944" avoided. Even the BOOK that is on the Manhattan murder bullet casings hasn't been asserted all year 2025.

We’re evolving too slowly for the world we’ve built. As industrialization accelerates, human biology is struggling to keep pace. Many of the chronic stress-related health issues we face today may be the predictable result of forcing Stone Age physiology into a world it was never built for.

People are so amused to death and entertained at mocking Putin and Trump... they don't give a shit about death of real people. As Trump provides fiction thrills, fiction content, fiction entertainment. Abandonment of reality being called out. Recency bias / short memory being called out. As important.

Specific education and nonfiction learning of dementia. Not just saying the word "dementia" in a comment on Blueksy or Reddit, but actually learning. You see avoidance of this during COVID-19 too. People who insult and mock but won't link / quote / cite sources and teerminology and debate improtant seirous topics with intelligent science information and intellectual discource. Not just jokes, chanting, amusement memes.

Same day on Reddit, will social media finally start repeating serious links instead of just repeating "Epstein List" messages over and over? https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1pf25zz/trump_showing_signs_hes_battling_major_medical/

So much bullshit in society drowns out peer to peer important assertions. Public health. Public House vs. Private House eating asserted. Customer right to see how the sausage is made. Reddit DROWNS important shit in disposable posting and commenting and not confronting the Trumpism Corporate America FDA system of dehumanzing the consumers / fleecing consumers with bad education / Department of Education. Reddit hive mind asserts so much brainrot into the shit since year 2013 that important Wiki-style organized assert is wrecked internet wide.

And all the wealth that goes into keep Reddit end-users addicted to content, not sleeping. Viego game industry, sports industry, slepless nights from Trump anxiety, Elon Musk Twitter mocking people who sleep, etc. Information oveerload, drowning important stories like this, with addictions to kitten images on /r/All along sidethe Middle East Formula 1 star worship (comedy washing / sports-washing Middle East wealth on Reddit /r/All). Constant marketing to make content consumption lifestyle anti-sleep, keeping up with the Jonses on memes in the high-speed media junkie fast lanes.

So many fixated on one golfing man with his orange skin and "dementia" diagnosis. That people can't see the forest of We The People for the golf trees. The abandonment of science. Why Dr. Bandy X Lee isn't a household name / Reddit asserted in comments like "Epstein" name... because Dr. Bandy X Lee isn't entertainment Reality TV like Epstein private jet Private Fantasy Island entertainment of Trump MAGA Tony Clifton performances. Health care / mental health knowledge junked and drowned by more mockery psotings that will push it off the front page.

Reddit front page. USA Reddit front page of the World Wide Web, Human Species. This story will get drowned out in all the memenoise and kitten images. The earth is over 8 billion humans, the time is NOW to confront the MOST OBVIOUS, BLINDING BRIGHT, Egoism of Putin and MAGA leadership, Musk Twitter, Reddit Musk influence, Truth Socail media, Murdoch Fox News. The avoidance of Jen Senko, the avoidance of nonfiction learning about Surkov and being able to name Surkov students and the IRA. Reddit is entertainment-washing these serious health postings about children's future, just as it does with Malala year 2012 and year 2013... will not sustain focus and asserting of improtance. We do not require digital images of kittens and cats every hour on the front page - we need a sense of improtance of human children / human species. Egomania / egoism run wilde, concern only for friends, while hating out-groups like Russia does to Ukraine and USA does to Mexico and Canada.

Billionares replaced nonfiction education and learning systems, Wikipedia, with meme mills. Wikipedia doesn't make the owners billionares: Twitter does, Fox News HDTV does, Facebook does, Twitch does, fiction outsells nonfiction. STD is nonfiction. That isn't popular except as jokes and insults in fiction storytelling and on meme mills like Reddit. Ha ha ha lol lol amused to death audience that thinks calling poltiicans with STD brain dmaage all day every day is thrilling politics. https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/01/31/trump-speaks-out-on-red-hand-marks-maybe-its-ai/ - social media is a anti-education anti-nonfiction culture of Truth Social / Reality TV "The Apprentice" followers to Rupert Murdoh "Fox News Nation" https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/business/media/fox-news-nation-streaming.html

And don't be fooled. Even when these services fail, even when people don't go to Fox News HDTV or Truth Social, Reddit constantly screen shots it for anti-intelligence anti-intellectual low-effort disposable commenting. Anti-wikipedia on important medical knowedge.

Just like the front-page screen shot says these words are about. "Murder by words", no, the killing of people with COVID-2019 spreading is due to Reddit society not making front-page SUSTAINED every day the spreading of disease by Putin.

Important Wiki style assertion of "ok, let's be serious 2 or 3 days a week" nonfiction learning gets abandoned by adults who dial into video games, kitten images (not kittens, IMAGES photo attraction screen games, simualcra), Trump news on /r/All all the fucking time for over 10 years, since June 6, 2015. Commenting that attacks nonfiction books and metaphor teaching in favor of "Duh, this is a wendy's where we praise Trump as a soure of hate and mocking leadership!"
