# Health Care Knowledge Junked

USA society by not focusing on Wiki style sharing of the best refined medical information.... and instead focused on secrets / trade practice / high priced closed-admission schools for brand-name degrees...

blah blah, how does one describe such systemic dehumanization? The weight of so many people who want to watch other people be sick and suffering so they can have the egoism of a better life. "Better choices" competition.

Specific education and nonfiction learning of dementia. Not just saying the word "dementia" in a comment on Blueksy or Reddit, but actually learning. You see avoidance of this during COVID-19 too. People who insult and mock but won't link / quote / cite sources and terminology and debate important serious topics with intelligent science information and intellectual discourse. Not just jokes, chanting, amusement memes.

Same day on Reddit, will social media finally start repeating serious links instead of just repeating "Epstein List" messages over and over? https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1pf25zz/trump_showing_signs_hes_battling_major_medical/

The earth is over 8 billion humans, the time is NOW to confront the MOST OBVIOUS, BLINDING BRIGHT, Egoism of Putin and MAGA leadership, Musk Twitter, Reddit Musk influence, Truth Soc ail media, Murdoch Fox News. The avoidance of Jen Senko, the avoidance of nonfiction learning about Surkov and being able to name Surkov students and the IRA. Reddit is entertainment-washing these serious health postings about children's future, just as it does with Malala year 2012 and year 2013... will not sustain focus and asserting of importance. We do not require digital images of kittens and cats every hour on the front page - we need a sense of importance of human children / human species. Egomania / egoism run wild, concern only for friends, while hating out-groups like Russia does to Ukraine and USA does to Mexico and Canada.

Billionaires replaced nonfiction education and learning systems, Wikipedia, with meme mills. Wikipedia doesn't make the owners billionaires: Twitter does, Fox News HDTV does, Facebook does, Twitch does, fiction outsells nonfiction. STD is nonfiction. That isn't popular except as jokes and insults in fiction storytelling and on meme mills like Reddit. Ha ha ha lol lol amused to death audience that thinks calling politicians with STD brain damage all day every day is thrilling politics. https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2024/01/31/trump-speaks-out-on-red-hand-marks-maybe-its-ai/ - social media is a anti-education anti-nonfiction culture of Truth Social / Reality TV "The Apprentice" followers to Rupert Murdoch "Fox News Nation" https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/business/media/fox-news-nation-streaming.html

And don't be fooled. Even when these services fail, even when people don't go to Fox News HDTV or Truth Social, Reddit constantly screen shots it for anti-intelligence anti-intellectual low-effort disposable commenting. Anti-Wikipedia on important medical knowledge.

Just like the front-page screen shot says these words are about.

End of year 2025. Sex, sex, sex with children. Ignore health care USA abuse of children. Ignore that food safety due to deregulation. Ignore the education of children that are handed over to predatory billionaires to exploit with worship-men media systems. Only sex turn-on topics for people to flock to all year 2025.  https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/22/american-food-safety-funding-cuts-foodnet/ it's ok to poison children age 11, but the only thing the Reddit society wants to keep repeating and stay focused on is sex / pleasure of sex / beauty of sex / sex sells. Instead of addressing that the problem is ant-learning, anti-honest, anti-truth, anti-goodness, anti-sincerity, anti-integrity - it is only sex that attracts sex-addicted (sex content addicts) media consumers of Reddit society. 

Children can be sickened and enslaved by dishonest and manipulative USA society leaders - but only the sex acts attract the front page of /r/All reporting. That's why adults do it, the whole society is thrilled and titillated with sex acts and power over sex - having sex that other people don't have. That's how Putin and Epstein lead so many powerful men - because sex conquest turns heads. Sex conquest gets you to the front page of Reddit /r/All every hour of every day in year 2025. Being a liar and manipulator and not taking all serious topics seriously is ignored - only the sexy children attraction topic is what Reddit audiences crave. 

Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 film about taking on EVERY abuse by elders in power to harm the future of children gets ignored. Sustained focus on media addiction / media empires / media systems addictions that lead to these children being abused doesn't want to be taken seriously. the media consumers want to consume media about sex from these abusive billionaire that wreck Every AREA OF LIFE WITH MANIPULATION OF MINDS. Sustained focus on the people who cover up mind abuse. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad

Children are being raised to worship Luigi's weapon system, gun worship USA, more of the same gun worship. Instead of social media being a force of nonfiction serious learning and repeating on critical health care and life topics of USA... people make it action gun violence content worship.

Howard Bloom used this as an example (medical staff disliking people) in his August 2000 book, Y2K book. Mass Mind / Global brain behaviors.

* "Robert Sapolsky discovered how wild baboons who couldn’t gain status in their tribe were flooded with hormonal poisons which killed off their brain cells, made their hair fall out, invited illness to come in and stay a while, and threatened their very lives. Humans are apparently the same. **Investigations have revealed that the hospital patients who need help the most — those submerged in depression — are the least likely to receive their doctors’ and nurses’ tender, loving attention**. Careful scrutiny indicates that the sufferers are unwittingly triggering their own rejection. **Depressed patients whine, snarl, or turn their faces to the wall in ways that alienate their doctors and nurses**. They upset their caregivers through every means from facial expression and verbal intonation to body language. An individual selectionist would explain that such self-damaging behavior must be the result of an adaptive response — one with a hidden benefit. The patient’s death might boost the genetic success of close relatives by relieving them of a burden or by enriching them with insurance and bequests. In addition, by subtly doing themselves in the patients might benefit friends who could return the favor to their family someday." - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. by Howard Bloom
