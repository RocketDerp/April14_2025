James Joyce is a great author at drawing circles around this crisis of metaphor not being understood.

"The Fiction NonFictiono Equation" of Joseph Campbell    

* “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor     
* CAMPBELL: Well, you find an awful lot of laws in the Old Testament.
  MOYERS: But that’s the transformation of religion to theology. Religion begins with the sense of wonder and awe and the attempt to tell stories that will connect us to God. Then it becomes a set of theological works in which everything is reduced to a code, to a creed.
  CAMPBELL: That’s the reduction of mythology to theology. Mythology is very fluid. Most of the myths are self-contradictory. You may even find four or five myths in a given culture, all giving different versions of the same mystery. Then theology comes along and says it has got to be just this way. Mythology is poetry, and the poetic language is very flexible. Religion turns poetry into prose. God is literally up there, and this is literally what he thinks, and this is the way you’ve got to behave to get into proper relationship with that god up there.  - Joseph Campbell, Power of Myth

Propeganda, marketing, advertising, public relations, mind-fuck, Cambridge Anlytica, Students of Vlad Surkov, Students of Edward Bernays.

Banksy was one of the few to articulate this to the masses, but not good enough for people.

Malala has conveyed what James Joyce was saying about Dublin, Malala about Swat Valley.   

Super Wikpedia, Series of Wikis, serious effort on Wiki is about buidling relationships between meaning / comrephension / understanding and not just sweet sounding popular "well written" Prose.

I am sickened by well written prose and well crafted movies / films / Television / content that deeaches us into Eden and Heaven without our own desire to progress / construction / authoring it.

I have experienced what Marshall McLuhan described in 1968 book (year before my 1969 birth) "War and Peace in the Global Village" with the Ten Thunders of Finnegans Wake, and all the other combined things Marshall McLuhan (died in 1980) and Joseph Campbell (died in 1987) have said about James Joyce (Finnegans Wake).

I have seen how people feel and react towards black and white films.  
I have witnessed and exepreinced peers responding to 1980's films vs 1990's films.   
What McLuhan emphasizes about clothing / fashion / Prankqueen in Joyce. 

https://joycegeek.com/category/the-prankquean/

Fashion changes, cosmetic changes, color themes. Music style changes. Music technology changes (analog tape, digital, multi-track recording, live broadcasting, in-pocket device to access online library when wanting to share some clip). The over-writing of Dr. Who and other shows, the days of TV before it was even recorded and always live. Langauge shifts across time.

I have experienced this when so many have not seem to recognize it other than in a lot of chiche ways. We do not cheery pick goodness from the past, we declare a whole time period good or bad, and we are not progressively cherry-picking and carrying-forward good.

Why since 2013 is Malala not a constant emphasis and assertion on social media? Not good enough Malala. 

Language no longer conveys.

Campbell described this in 1987: "Ortega y Gasset talks about the environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a mechanistic interpretation of the world came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive to the hero. The hero is today running up against a hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need."

Marshall McLuhan is correct, people driven to Bluesky in 2024, new technology - new medium - and not addressing the Twitter problem Neil Postman 1985 and Carl Sagan 1995 both articulated about length.

Why after decades of Twiter / SMS, have we not shifted back towards Wikipedia. Siple Wikipedia to complex, and multiple Wiki Values systems of inclusive (beyond scope of Wikipedia itself). Every Subreddit had a wikipedia, but the streaming recency bias of latest 12 hours defines communities. We abandoned the precursor to Wiki systems, the Internet FAQ on topics.

## Sunday August 24, 2025 headline Europe 

Language and diplomacy and thinking itself abandoned by humanity    
Woodstock 1969 forgotten in mass man / mass mind     
Marshall McLuhan Global Village taken over by Internet shit-talk of Donald Trump social media behaviors and Putin IRA / Musk Twitter / Murdoch global media values. Neil Postman was correct in 1985, Amusing Ourselves to Death mind loophole unpatched by education.    
As Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers discussed, "Death for a Metaphor", in summer of 1987 when Campbell was age 83. In modern terms, "death for memes". The Cruisades between religons becomes The Cruisades between meme systems / filter bubbles / subreddits / subscribe and follow audiences.    
Wasteland without spirit, spirtual values abandoned. Woodstock 1969 was spirtual of We The People of media of recorded music and radio networks for western world that was like a book-printing press revolution - but it became controlled by copyright cartels and language lines / cultural lines did not spread with the move from analog to digital and eventually the Internet. Wikipedia / Wiki style open systems were known to the world educators / public library - but not adopted.

##### Unedited dump A   

The world of human affairs does not work without love and compassion. Hate thy enemy, hate thy neighbor makes for a shit social media society that makes Donald Trump on Twitter / Truth Social /  Fox News a role model for children and leadership. 

For the record: Karl Marx in Germany in 1848 did not invent what is clearly stated in the Levant Bible 2,000 years ago in verse "1 John 3:17"

If people are attracted to Putin and Trump and the messages of the Internet Research Agency since year 2013 - if that is the signal people follow, that is the world we created. 

All the 1960's music revolutions of abandoning classic religion, complete religion deconstructions in the spirit of James Joyce's Star Wars Force Day 1939 publication of Finnegans Wake and 1969 The Who Tommy album... have been thrown into wealth-collecting music cartels / copyright cartels.

Social media society had a choice starting in October 2013 with the public rise of Malala Yousafzai and her ideas of changing the world.

*  **“If one man can destroy everything, why can't one girl change it?”** ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. Published October 8, 2013. 

Malala Yousafzai did a book tour in October 2013, she was covered in the global press. And social media society didn't bother retweeting her and making her words a sustained topic of assertion.

One month later, November 9, 2013. Miss Universe 2013 was the 62nd Miss Universe pageant, held at the Crocus City Hall in Krasnogorsk, Moscow, Russia, on 9 November 2013. Hosted by status symbol Donald J. Trump.

October 8, 2013 Malala's book on liberation of women globally.       
November 9, 2013 Putin and Trump's Moscow sex show of women globally.   

We The People of the social meme societies, the audience, spoke every day since October 8, 2013 in our avoidance. The free time and spare time spent  in service to the discussing Donald J. Trump poop diapers, orange skin, golf course outings and private jet sex trips could have been spare social media time name-dropping and retweeting Malala's ideas.
