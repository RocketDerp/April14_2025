1. If he hates other people, I will vote for him.
2. If he bombs and kills other people, I will vote for him
3. The "Settled for" attitudes people have with in their religion clergy and politicians / government but will not settle for in personal relationships. 
4. If he controls the food and water safety of others (to be toxic), I will vote for him.
5. Disowning of children over issues. Disowning of parents.
6. Boss men, employers, doing harmful things entirely silent / avoidant to criticize.

I have lived in Africa, Middle East, all over USA, in South America, Mayalsia, Indonesia - I have seen this pattern play out over and over. As if abuse of ANY kind is acceptable. Entire religions hate upon entire other religons and people don't think this is a problem or concern to criticize. They are unwilling to apply their personal secreative (hidden in private house) relationship scrutiny to groups.

Neil Postman 1992 Technopoly questions applied to new AI    
https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mnsaez/educational_ai_risks_becoming_an_authoritarian/    
Rick Roderick 1993: "But any intellect that powerful has a tendency to become totalitarian. This is the fundamental problem and nowhere would that be more evident than in the experience of the Germans who were, you know, great at their technology, the advance in science and so on, a world as instrumentally rational, you know, the famous joke that their trains run on time, but the flipside of enlightenment has been to, sort of, give up before the overpowering forces of technology in a more abject surrender than any that was ever called for in religion. I mean, to just abjectly surrender before the powers of technology and given the current state of the powers of technology, they far surpass the characteristics that we associate with God. I mean, think of it in this simple way. In The Bible, in the book of Revelations, the apocalypse is a magnificent myth, but long ago it became what in our society? A reality! A technologically achievable reality. What had been a myth became a technologically achievable reality."

Choice marriage honesty, economic honesty, money required to raise children after pregnancy     
Origins of Marriage, why were wedding rituals divised all over the Pale Blue Dot. My view is often that men wanted casual sex, recreational sex, and adults had to teach children the consequences of sexual pleasure - obligation to care for, feed, raise a child. The rituals of marriage were divsed so that women were not quickly impregnated and then abandoned. These rituals of marriage served as a society firmware educational fix to a hardware (biological) reality. To both the age 13 boys and age 13 girls.  Witnessing wedding rituals conveyed that parental bonding obligations went beyond sexual lust and attraction that men have to women.

"@6:20 - but it's a common fantasy from book authors, competitive athletes, video game makers. If only that person hadn't gotten that knee injury in university sports they would have made it professional. If only the Olympic athlete had not gotten sick on the flight to the host nation. There are only 3 recognized winners, gold / silver / bronze - mathematically you can't all be number 1. There are tuns of great musicians on YouTube and they don't all get "big break" and become profitable. For every 1 famous, there are hundreds who had complications or didn't have social connections."

me: "Computer industry lore... I used to work for SAP at their USA HQ back in 1993, and R/3 was booming like crazy and the money was pouring in. We had standing orders with every major laptop company (IBM, Toshiba, etc) for their HIGHEST-END models, as many as they could sell us, for the extremely well paid salespeople. If a new model came out with color TFT screens even slightly better than an old model, we would order as many as the factory could provide. It seems that the wealthy Corporate America companies taking the sales pitch for software loved seeing a demo of the latest laptop hardware models... salespeople had found a sexy way to get corporate executive attention, the Windows laptop, while demonstrating the pretty bland-looking R/3 thin client app."

Remedial morality   
Where do we teach morality? The Church was doing a bad job of teaching morality in USA society year 1935 so we largely abandoned church in the 1960's (Woodstock, rock music, The Beatles, etc)... but shcools do not teach morality. Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan describes how corrupt teaching of morality (like 1935 Church in USA) is bad and reforms moralty education. She actively describes what is right and what is wrong (despite being a Muslim, Malala support films about transgender, etc).   

https://old.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1mpz6w0/body_cam_footage_shows_olympic_sprinter_shacarri/

"Sha’Carri Richardson put her hands on her boyfriend and was arrested on a fourth-degree domestic assault charge. She falsely accused her boyfriend of being the one who hit her but the airport security cameras showed otherwise. And then she told the cops verbatim “why am I being arrested and he’s the man in the situation?”. You can’t make this stuff up…"

I think the USA social media society of Bluesky and Reddit need to develop a morality Wiki on parenting, marriage, dating, weddings, funerals, car accidents, medical secrecy, mental health resposnes, police responses, voting, deception, war, terrorism, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC.  PREVENTION, PREVENTION, PREVENTION through learning, educatin, sharing mistakes. And when a public topic like this comes up (video footage of a person being arrested and public debate), be able to cite and link the Wiki system and show that the problem is known and education and teaching is available on the subject.

We are a reactionary society that is engaged in reacting to "breaking news" events of a person's behavior and not preventative and educational oriented. Malala from Pakistan has shown a consistent focus on educaiton and teaching from her father and her's efforts gong back decades.
