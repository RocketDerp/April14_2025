Endless content on these topics:

1. If he hates other people, I will vote for him.
2. If he bombs and kills other people, I will vote for him
3. The "Settled for" attitudes people have with in their religion clergy and politicians / government but will not settle for in personal relationships. 
4. If he controls the food and water safety of others (to be toxic), I will vote for him.
5. Disowning of children over issues. Disowning of parents.
6. Boss men, employers, doing harmful things entirely silent / avoidant to criticize.

I have lived in Africa, Middle East, all over USA, in South America, Mayalsia, Indonesia - I have seen this pattern play out over and over. As if abuse of ANY kind is acceptable. Entire religions hate upon entire other religons and people don't think this is a problem or concern to criticize. They are unwilling to apply their personal secreative (hidden in private house) relationship scrutiny to groups.

“If there is to be peace in the world,   
There must be peace in the nations.   
If there is to be peace in the nations,   
There must be peace in the cities.   
If there is to be peace in the cities,   
There must be peace between neighbors.   
If there is to be peace between neighbors,   
There must be peace in the home.   
If there is to be peace in the home,   
There must be peace in the heart.”
