2. If he bombs and kills other people, I will vote for him
3. The "Settled for" attitudes people have with in their religion clergy and politicians / government but will not settle for in personal relationships. 
4. If he controls the food and water safety of others (to be toxic), I will vote for him.
5. Disowning of children over issues. Disowning of parents.
6. Boss men, employers, doing harmful things entirely silent / avoidant to criticize.

I have lived in Africa, Middle East, all over USA, in South America, Mayalsia, Indonesia - I have seen this pattern play out over and over. As if abuse of ANY kind is acceptable. Entire religions hate upon entire other religons and people don't think this is a problem or concern to criticize. They are unwilling to apply their personal secreative (hidden in private house) relationship scrutiny to groups.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1mnsaez/educational_ai_risks_becoming_an_authoritarian/    
Rick Roderick 1993: "But any intellect that powerful has a tendency to become totalitarian. This is the fundamental problem and nowhere would that be more evident than in the experience of the Germans who were, you know, great at their technology, the advance in science and so on, a world as instrumentally rational, you know, the famous joke that their trains run on time, but the flipside of enlightenment has been to, sort of, give up before the overpowering forces of technology in a more abject surrender than any that was ever called for in religion. I mean, to just abjectly surrender before the powers of technology and given the current state of the powers of technology, they far surpass the characteristics that we associate with God. I mean, think of it in this simple way. In The Bible, in the book of Revelations, the apocalypse is a magnificent myth, but long ago it became what in our society? A reality! A technologically achievable reality. What had been a myth became a technologically achievable reality."

Choice marriage honesty, economic honesty, money required to raise children after pregnancy     
Origins of Marriage, why were wedding rituals divised all over the Pale Blue Dot. My view is often that men wanted casual sex, recreational sex, and adults had to teach children the consequences of sexual pleasure - obligation to care for, feed, raise a child. The rituals of marriage were divsed so that women were not quickly impregnated and then abandoned. These rituals of marriage served as a society firmware educational fix to a hardware (biological) reality. To both the age 13 boys and age 13 girls.  Witnessing wedding rituals conveyed that parental bonding obligations went beyond sexual lust and attraction that men have to women.

We had standing orders with every major laptop company (IBM, Toshiba, etc) for their HIGHEST-END models, as many as they could sell us, for the extremely well paid salespeople. If a new model came out with color TFT screens even slightly better than an old model, we would order as many as the factory could provide. It seems that the wealthy Corporate America companies taking the sales pitch for software loved seeing a demo of the latest laptop hardware models... salespeople had found a sexy way to get corporate executive attention, the Windows laptop, while demonstrating the pretty bland-looking R/3 thin client app."

Remedial morality   
Where do we teach morality? The Church was doing a bad job of teaching morality in USA society year 1935 so we largely abandoned church in the 1960's (Woodstock, rock music, The Beatles, etc)... but shcools do not teach morality. Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan describes how corrupt teaching of morality (like 1935 Church in USA) is bad and reforms moralty education. She actively describes what is right and what is wrong (despite being a Muslim, Malala support films about transgender, etc).   

https://old.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1mpz6w0/body_cam_footage_shows_olympic_sprinter_shacarri/

"Sha’Carri Richardson put her hands on her boyfriend and was arrested on a fourth-degree domestic assault charge. She falsely accused her boyfriend of being the one who hit her but the airport security cameras showed otherwise. And then she told the cops verbatim “why am I being arrested and he’s the man in the situation?”. You can’t make this stuff up…"

I think the USA social media society of Bluesky and Reddit need to develop a morality Wiki on parenting, marriage, dating, weddings, funerals, car accidents, medical secrecy, mental health resposnes, police responses, voting, deception, war, terrorism, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC.  PREVENTION, PREVENTION, PREVENTION through learning, educatin, sharing mistakes. And when a public topic like this comes up (video footage of a person being arrested and public debate), be able to cite and link the Wiki system and show that the problem is known and education and teaching is available on the subject.

We are a reactionary society that is engaged in reacting to "breaking news" events of a person's behavior and not preventative and educational oriented. Malala from Pakistan has shown a consistent focus on educaiton and teaching from her father and her's efforts gong back decades.

Selling Quran pages / ideas / memes, selling Bible verses to the audience was how people were being sold an afterlife holiday of Heaven and Judgement Day againsst those you hate an disagree with.  Revenge Judgement Day by Jesus (in Quran and Bible both) and punishment of Hell - very much a Dinsey Star Wars Experience you pay for and you fund the venue (Cinema / Theater for the Star Wars showing / Mecca / Mosque / Church). And what qualifications do these professional clergy have, to be loyal to the media cartel for that one media. As if they mix Navajo Pollen Path and say "all people are equal all over the world" they violate the Mosque and Church tradition of "only believers in our story go to Heaven" qualification of the clergy in-group.

“The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.”

"I also wonder why he’s so incredibly bad at it.  He’s had all of my personal data since 2007 and I’m clearly a tee-total bookish nerd who likes philosophy, plants and arduinos and he’s spending billions to show me ads for Carlsberg beer, football and films featuring Jason Statham. "

he s making money showing you those adverts, it is a scam against other corporations. And it influences you to mention those things on Reddit right now and in conversations in your lfe.   A sesnse of community is built even if in opposition. Donald Trump era is mastery of making people hate the advertised product (Donald Trump being the product from some aspects, but mubh more). Hate itself being the means of deepest attraction in fiction-driven total mockery engagement .     

Haven't people figured out that many marriages and parents have driven their life base don hate. They are mroe concrned about their rules of enslaving their child and spouse... if the spouse cheats on them they will end the marriage and abuse the children with lesosns of how to hate someone you promised a lifetime commitment to? There is no concept of heaven or afterlife or metaphore of transition. And the cheating spouse enjoys the secrecy of keeping their sexual desires away from the marriage or in general being hostile inside the marriage towards sex. This sort of thing happens with choice marriage all over the world. Like corporate PR, people can go to extremes to cobe it up with lawyers as PR agents and sealed secret proceedings - but data leaks reveal it / famous people are spooted in public and the true story comes out regardless of the expensive lawyers and public relations teams ding cover-up in corporate secrecy style of the marriage behaviors. hell, DNA testing has reveals many supposedly perfect executions of deception in marriage were false. Religions are the same, if secret cameeras had covered more child abuse of children by clergy... but most of the time it is decades-later clusterfuck of accusatoons (Same with Jimmy Savile in UK, people covered it up for decades and all came ou tin huge numbers).  People PRIZA this disonesty. They write novels and books dislcosing these behaviors of friends and family they ahve witnessed, even their own self. This isn't honesty and truth in love, this is copycatting dishonest clergy promising afterlife, dishonest politicians like Donald Trump a role model of every area of life (not just governing), dishonest advertising and marketing promising services and products that are not true. The dishoensty that the human race not only "settles for" in marriages, but is attracted to in every aspect of lie from survival food (mcDona'ds "I am loving it" marketing) to corporate workpalce (much of the daytime living hours devoted to creating deception against humans, one corportion bombarding We The People, in the name of network of other corportions). Marketing with deception, Edward Bernays manipualtion, is the religion faith people live undder. And the secrets of the consumption of films / tv / books shows the true marriage secrecy of cheating / lies. 

Is the sexual cheating even as much an issue as the clever lies abou tit? "Too mcuh love", "I fell in love with 3 people" is the nightmare. Can't have people falling in love too many times. But we can have too many people falling in love with Russian flag that die for invasion of Ukraine. Too many people fall in love with Quran sotrytelling and become Palestine terrorists on morning of October 7, 2023. You can flal in love to join a military killer with dedicated death machines.... but you can't fall in love with too many men or woemn in your marriage. We kill by the millions, but we can't even love by the half-dozen unless it is a Donald Trump audience who *lvoes to hate others*. Putin audience of obident hate values. 

This is the shit that keeps me up at night on a Friday night going into Saturday. As the timestamp will reveal at 03:30 early morning. I'm not spell checking this shit, nobody cares. I keep looking for someone else to write these ideas and all I ifnd are dead men like Joseph Campbell, James Joyce, Neil Postman.

Facebook owner isn't bad at selling you hate for beer and hate for football and getting it into a Reddit conversation. No more than the clergy and wedding industry selling you fantasy of billionare retirement holidays after age 65. I spent decades livign in RV at age 30 to 50 seeing old people age 75 convinced that driving a dangerous complex machine with poor vision and worn-out body is a great thing because the marketing and advertising told them that Florida and Arizona RV life was perfect. And yes, some do revel in it, but some revel in Donald Trump age 79 role model for their grandchildren too. Many people do. What kind of dark dark dark fantasy is that to have Donald Trump creating life for your grandchildren in August 2025? That's the nightmare I am experiencing at 04:20 on Saturday August 16, 2025 that nobody wants to hear.

No, Facebook knows exactly how to sell you your nightmare as a tea-toadler.

Choice marriage honest. Sex sells, marketing, fashion, cosmetics, perfume, style changes, trend changes. Sposue got bored and wanted sex from others. Parenting and sex are two different things. Freedom, liberty to be silent, freedom to not communicate, freedom to dump people, liberty to raise children to worship Donald Trump as role model.   
"Exactly as the title says. We’d been together for four years. I was with her at the lowest of her lows and when she knew I needed her most she cheated on me. This was after we just had a newborn son who turned 5 months old last week.

I’m at a loss for words and honestly don’t know what to do. Def getting a gym membership lmao but yeah. Four years and a family down the drain because she couldn’t communicate with me and make me aware that she was losing interest.

It just hurts bc it feels like I was trying so hard to provide a happy home and was so excited to raise our son together only for this to happen. We’re currently dealing with so much and this was the cherry on top."

If people viewed sexual cravings / sex desires / attraction (smell, visual, wealth, etc) like they view drug addiction (sex hormones and sex marketing "sex sells" programming are like drugs / LSD is Finnegans Wake), alcohol binge (getting drunk, falling off wagon, self-harm of booze), like gambling (sex shows and casinos often pair, as does booze and smoking), smoking addiction, obesity / food / binge eating / eating disorders including rituals of stavation and religion fasting... but we don't actually face up to sex being driven by the seasons of the year and hormone events like pregnancy or menopause in our thinking - despite witnessing fish have sex seasons and ocean patterns (and fish don't bite hooks during certain weather conditions or shade conditions or water depth), despite seeing animals like deer and bears have mating seasons... humans don't think our bodies have any of that inside them and we let billionares people traffic sex symbols to music stages and hollywood films and bollywood films and advertising and marketing of Torches of Freedom in NYC to smell toxic cancer death by smoking. And we expect a couple to be in a boat in this toxic igornace culture ocean. We don't help marriages and parenting, we have predaotry billionres like Elon Musk selling anti-empahty Twitter platform content since year 2022 takeover of Twitter, deliberate sbotage of compassion by the richest man in the world. War on compassion, war on empaty, war on nonficiton and omprehension of how marketing / advertising / "sex sells" / domination by billionares with mind-fuck Twitter and Cambridge Analytica and Torches of Freedom. And every "little guy" in this billionare predator mind-fuck workd (private jet sex life, rock star orgy groupies, sports star sex icons gorupies - woned by bllionaires as long-term passive income selling copyrighted sex stimulation music and sports stars)... thinks it is their personal need to buy billionare clothing fashion and automobile and speak the way the Hollywood sings and speaks - or their personal attraction doesn't work anymore, because the billionars already manipulated everone else around you into conformity to wealth admiration peer pressure.

When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in Swat Valley Pakistan, do what the Taliban do. When in USA 2025, do what Americans do... worship Donald Trump hate and anti-compassion. Worship the anti-empathy and anti-compasson of Elon Musk. Because it is *trending*, and just like Japan in 1940 or Germany in 1940, if hate and war are *trending* you follow the peer pressure trend.  If sex urges are being planted in your subconsious by billionares in Russia or Trump private jet sex tour topics or Elon Musk anti-compassion - just follow the trend, no matter if you see everyone trending into wrecking the future of their children - don't speak up, make it ONLY your own personal life, don't study the mass mind.

“The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... **No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven** to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.” - Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945

Or people sit on couch at home consuming billionare-provied processed foods while advertising said foods - and sponsors - and watch people go around trinalge baseball or rectangle sportsball fields. What do you think hacker video games are? Fiction sells, ,nonfiction isn't popular. Vibe coding is a fiction video game, ChatGPT / Grok AI - they provide fiction interation, ELIZA effect.

German parents enjoyed World War One so much they flokced to Hitler to create World War Two. On the mass mind toxic culture, Germany liked war and machines, and probably a lot of marriages people claimed in Germany they *loved each other* and a lot of Church gatherins in Germany they claimed they *loved*, and the sitll flocked to Hitler as a leader and were unable to confince th Church-attending authority-worshipign (Jesus as authority / God as authority) admiring people to not admire Hitler's authority.  And yet, isntead of rescuing toxic parents - people think that it's fine to let people flock to horrible values and concepts of "love" and "compassion" if they are in a gang of Hitler culture or gang of Church culture that promotes toxic dehumanizaiton (Heaven awaits, die for Hitler, as Heaven is your reward, die for Mosque - die as a terrorism supporter - Heaven rewaard awaits fiction).   
But USA let Ronald Regan back into their life and 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" was published ot describe how people will sell their souls and their children's future for an entertainment leader of their world. Just like religions sell science fiction enteratinment (Torah, Bible, Quran) and peoople will allow clergy to abuse their children's future. As long as it is a club of abusement. People allow Donald Trump seonc term back into their life despite him guilt-tripping people for not supporting Trump even *more* and worshiping MAGA values *even more* guilt tripping message campaigns.   
https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1mubbft/havnt_talked_to_my_mom_in_15_years_since_i_was_14/

My point, since no words from any author in all the public library can seem to get it across, my point: how can you criticize ONE parent when yhou see aroudn you a toxic ocean of hate and manipulation by gangs of people in organizations called corporations, religions, politicla parties, sports fans, Fox News audeince, Twitter audience, Reddit audience, etc- and not call out that the education itself - the consumption of values that people take in from Donald Trump role model and Reddit junk memes - is the very way they learn their idea of morality and behavior. Making Donald Trump a role model a *seonc time* and not able to open the Donald Trump $59.99 Bible and repeat and repeat and repeat on social media that verse "1 John 3:17" is instructing YOU, every person, to **judgement upon Donald Trump and Elon Musk** - to use your JUDGEMENT / audit Donald Trump and Elon Musk love vs. wealth.

If you swim in an ocean of toxic people with toxic morality, you think to praise the 500 out of 5,000 parents who actually surivive and not criticize the ocean toxic that everyone is filling with their MAGA hate worship and faith in hate in global society? One nation is sinking the entire world with hate messaging, joining in with a second nation, Russia.

Did you discuss the toxic ocean withi the mother? I've discussed it witht he Reddit community, and egomania responses of avoiding the GROUP mob mentality hate always come. Who do you see discussing the AFTERMATH / SIDE EFFECTS of Cambridge Analytica? Instead, toxic marriages and toxic parents get singled out - and everyone is expected to do fine in a TOXIC society of ocean of hate as faith. The hate Donald Trump hate MAGA hate humanism society of August 2025 is itself causing symptoms in everyday people.

Me: People get divorced and remarried. People can be more married to their political party or their religion clergy or their boss at job than a spouse. Who teaches marriage, as Joseph Campbell asked in year 1987? People don't understand spirtual marriages - even incredibly smart people - and the sophisticated technical vocabulary depicted about the non-spiritual marriage fits experience. Children and parenting too, climate change and 10 years of Donald Trump role model in Texas Hill Country. I was divorced in Texas Hill Country, where Bobby has his resturant, so ;)

"Because it is.
Especially the first one. You’re not supposed to hit within first line power strike during warm-up, and you always aim straight and never cross.

This was such a common thing to do against teams we hated, but you could get disqualified for it.

Men’s volleyball is a little bit more strict. You do that to my setter, and you bet your ass someone is getting targeted with full-power spikes.

It’s funny, I always loved playing volleyball when we were young, but as you grow, all these rules kind of ruined the fun of antagonizing the opposite team. You can’t celebrate in front of your opponents, you have to turn your back to them.

But my all-time favorite was blocking a person and doing a little “X” with my finger on their side of the court. I got like multiple yellow cards because of it (all in different games). It's so hilariously disrespectful...but honestly it never stopped being funny to me."

This doctrine stresses that a ruler must embody the role of a ruler, and similarly for other societal roles, leading to proper conduct and effective governance.”

# Mandatory Hate

The popular toxic clergy teachings that you MUST hate the non-believers, you must hate people who change from one religion to another. You MUST HATE, MANDATORY HATE, of ex-lovers.  Shocking to pepole to see that some people find hate to be toxic.   
https://old.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1nued45/they_both_got_divorced_but_they_cant_stop_vibing/

Because of famous people, famous actors, who get voices to tell their story and have often automatic press coverage... we learn how common these things really are. People who worship hate, prize hate, teach hate, share hate, praise hate, program hate into their minds, are told by parents to seek out and practice hate. The MADATORY HATE of an ex-lover, how the person you love you must now hate!

Choice marriage honesty, choice marriage on a foundation of lies and deception. Just like Donald Trump is the leader of free natiion of "free choice" marriage role model. A society that flocks to liars as leaders. Booss man (workpalce relevant to cited posting topic) liars, employees who prize liars as leaders and role models, politicians as liars, lie to everyone as leadership technique.

The "Adults in the room", parents, made Donald Trump media star a role model for all other media stars and influencers and children. There is no call for remedial morality, just perpetual rounds of back and forth groups calling other groups dumb / stupid / moron / idiot oveer and over since June 2015.

Choice marriage honesty. Parenting and spouse inward journey is more difficult for many men than outward hunting. Roman empire, soldiers could go away for many years without their domestic life. USA culture during Afghanistan war, many young married soldiers away from home. Men can find it easier to kill strangers / murder in warfare to the public society than facing the inward egoism issues. Themes of Joyce's stories of Dublin and marraige of Stephen D.
