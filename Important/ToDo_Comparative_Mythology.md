Metaphors of male pregnancy   

Ok, so, there is some massive failure to recognize that science fiction storytelling has been core to humanity for a very long time. That the magical pregnancy from outer space { Eden, Heaven } of the mother of Jesus fandom. And the retcon science fiction story Quran vs. Bible that seems to eliminate the father Joseph of Jesus entirely. Magical message machines on top of mountains that get outer-space alien messages on burning bush.

Comparative Mythology topic is comparative Science Fiction outer-space storytelling, But people are unwilling to admit that Hamlet's Ghost story is similar to magical "angels" stories of { Torah, Quran, Bible } - or even 1977 "Force Ghost" stories of Star Wars films. The inability to translate science fiction stories of thousands of years ago to modern science fiction is a crisis. People form street gangs, terrorism, over their story fandom preferences. Easter bunny is science fiction storytelling. The ignorance and confusion on fiction vs. nonfiction is a very serious problem.

Moon landing monomyth.

October 8, 2013 - Swat Valley Pakistan. What came in more recent decades since 1969 moon landing.  “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban

Fiction media ecology, how science fiction Bible book programs minds, how popular magazine fiction printing programs minds.  Fiction monomyth vs. fiction monomyth storytelling. The Bible does not have color images, color media printing. But both Bible and magazine promote all-powerful male dictatorship. Girl in comic is invoking Romans 11:32 concept to Sky daddy Allah / Yahweh / Jesus male dominator.

Alcohol. And why some poetry and rituals hit harder for people, less brain numbing. Especially male aggression.

Very real behaviors I have witnessed. People who will have sex hookups and affairs, but are entirely unwilling to discuss their dreams and desires and boss / workplace honestly in a marriage given months of time. People that will hook up and trust strangers to prepare their food that can poison them when traveling but won't let family members do intimate things. Let taxi drivers threaten their life, let bosses risk their lives or manipulate their family health care (USA especially), etc.

The whole way people will worship a god and recommend and praise a god and pass a god to their children... that allows cancer, war, earthquakes, etc.
