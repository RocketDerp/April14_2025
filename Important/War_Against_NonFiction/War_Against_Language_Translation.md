# War Against Language Translation

It is incredibly difficult for most people, typically gifted people, neurotypical people, to translate from one spoken and written language to another.

I personally lived, immersive, in South America. Specifically Arica, Chile for one full year. This was before I comrephended autism, before I had studied autism language issues / diagoses with autism.

## War Against Metaphor to Metaphor, Meta Translation

Sarah Lawrence College (New York) professor spent his lifetime focused on the 1924 onward publican of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake media practititoner / langauge demosntrations. Joseph Campbell also married a fellow Joycian, one of his students. She created rock music operas / dance performances of Finnegans Wake. "The Coucah With Six Insides". Two Joyce teachers married together, both Americans who met in New York!

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

This equation:

1. Half (metaphrical usage) are wrong
2. Half are wrong
3. non-metaphor: EVERYONE is wrong, Half + Half = EVERYONE

Campbell does mean EVERYONE. As atheists in USA that Campbell worked confused being anti-Bible anti-Quran with being able to translate Star Wars science fiction to Moses burning bush "angels" aliens metaphors of science fiction. Campbell himself taught lessons about this at the science fiction creation center of huge success! In the summer of 1986 and sumer of 1987, George Lucas filmed Joseph Campbell at Sywalker Ranch, the Star Wars science fiction storytelling empire!

This point just can't be put blunt enough, it can not be hammered on enough. People fight, murder, The Cruisades of Muslim vs. Christian, Taliban vs. Scieence. Campbell did not live to see September 11, 2001 - but he surely predicted it loudly in his Skywawlker Ranch interviews! "hey don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future."

I really **don't know how to empahzie harder** that this short quote sums up the crisis, far beyond religion believers, but those who don't grasp rock music song lyrics, poetry, metaphors! “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

The title of the book "Thou Art That", YOU, the reader, are John 1:1 Bible verse, YOU are the Tower of Babel metaphor! YOU are the language tarnslator in how you read this very message I am now composing. You do not read it the same at age 22 as you read it age age 32. You do not read it the same way another person of age 22 reads it. Your very spouse or parents won't read it the same way as you do on the same day!

We must do our best to teach this problem!

### HELP HELP HELP!!!!!!

"he boon brought from the transcendent deep becomes quickly rationalized into nonentity, and **the need becomes great** for another hero to refresh the word. How teach again, however, what has been taught correctly and incorrectly learned a thousand thousand times, throughout the millenniums of mankind’s prudent folly? That is the hero’s ultimate difficult task. How render back into light-world **language the speech**-defying pronouncements of the dark? How represent on a two-dimensional surface a three-dimensional form, or in a three-dimensional image a **multi-dimensional meaning**? How **translate** into terms of “yes” and “no” revelations that **shatter into meaninglessness** every attempt to define the pairs of oppo-sites? How communicate to people who insist on the exclusive evidence of their senses **the message** of the all-generating void? Many failures attest to **the difficulties of this life-affirmative** threshold." - The Hero with a Thousand Faces (first published in 1949) is a work of comparative mythology by Joseph Campbell

This was published after Campbell's work with James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book of Dublin Ireland metaphors and singsong poetry.
