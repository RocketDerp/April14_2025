# Autism RFK Jr. genetics

"Autism isn't one disorder, a genetic analysis shows. The new research reinforces how complex the neurodevelopmental disorder is and that there isn’t a single cause."

# Autism USA experience

The experience of autism. Why is RFK Jr creating nonsense about it?

Why is JD Vance calling out a autism girl in Europe? Why is RFK Jr saying Tylonol causes autism? Are they trying to muddle the Nazi ties to autism?

If anything Greta practices "antics politics" like Kremlin and White House does. Competition from a young woman treating the antics techniques?

# Learning Disability Literacy 

September 19, 1977

Criminals in jail   

https://youtu.be/xtsTB3U8AeE?t=882


is nothing that's a one-liner
it's all we have time for attention span
gets
very weak at the speed of light and uh
that goes along with a very weak
identity
and religion which involves ideas
requires a little more time well
**religion is a form of indoctrination
which requires a considerable amount of
literacy**
you cannot get religion into people
minus literacy
and as literacy weakens people lose
their religious
affiliations you've written to or been
quoted as saying something to do with
**criminals in jail** who have watched
endless hours of television.

was that a put on?

15:22      
no that's a little mixed up
what i was referring to was a recent
study made in **colorado of the boys behind bars**
and the discovery was **that every one of them is a dyslexic!
this is behind prison bars yes in penitentiaries in in colorado**
100 dyslexic that is people with
learning just with disabilities
and uh this happens in our world there
have been studies in in
here in toronto and in in canada of the
same phenomenon
and the **strange thing is that 9 out of
10 dyslexic or nine out of ten learning
disability people
are boys only one in ten is a girl**

15:58    
but what's the relationship with
television or watching television does a
tv
is it has a strange effect on the eye
muscles
it tends to paralyze or to
hypnotize the motor muscles of the eyes
so that the much the much television
viewing person
tends to have a very poor ability to
move his eyes on the print over across
the printed word
or on the printed page and he needs
exercises to correct this and the
exercises need to be taken quite early
while he's in his early years because
the the otherwise they hardened but the
the ideal exercise for this purpose is
the trampoline
for loosening up the eye muscles but now
**the reason that boys are so
prone to this problem and girls are not**
is that the exercises that boys take
hockey and baseball and football these
exercises are very crude
and muscularly and do not help the eye
muscles in the reading activity

16:59     
whereas skipping and sewing and
cosmetics and so on uh give the girls a
much more delicate
muscular coordination than boys and
there they have less
**learning disability**. I see what now
briefly is this thing called media
ecology
it means arranging various media to help
each other so they won't cancel each
other out
to buttress one medium with another
the you might say for example that radio
is a bigger help to literacy than
television.
But television might be a very wonderful
aid to teaching languages
and so you can do some things on some
media that you cannot do on others
and therefore if you watch the whole
field you can prevent
this waste that comes by one canceling
the other
out we have paid no attention to the
effects
that for example as we've just been
talking about the effects of television
on the on the printed page
this radio movies don't have this effect
whether
they they don't uh slow down the eye
muscles
but uh we have never studied these
phenomena but do you
do you think that perhaps at the end of
your studies of media ecology you're
going to advise a cut down on watching
television five hundred dollars for
anyone just
give it up for a day europeans have cut
back on that almost down to nothing long
ago because they realized that they
threatened literate values very much the
uh
an hour an hour a week is what about the
french the french child gets for
television


18:30      
dr macleon you have admitted in the past
that uh you hate to see
the upheaval that our world is in true
i wouldn't say hate to see it but uh it
it is
a very confusing kind of world in which
as i say you have no time to get
adjusted to anything or acquainted with
anybody
you know we live in a world where one
you meet many many people per day
for the once and only time in your life
or their lives
but i'm thinking more about the fact
that born in winnipeg and
mastered in english and english has
largely studied at cambridge for
graduate studies how
english was largely your world and
literature
it's been under attack by these uh new
electronic media
especially television um this been hard
on you
uh i don't think so because there's
always the challenge after meeting the
opposition
head-on but you wouldn't like to see the
the literate world disintegrate yeah
by no means i i my values are strongly
centered in literacy
which i teach day and night as it were
and do you think
it will survive i imagine so
i think so it said too that you felt
hostile to modern life that you loathed
machinery
and uh well you hated big cities
um are they they're talking about maybe
a period when uh
i wrote the mechanical bride probably
it's a little while ago all right
i i haven't had much time to feel have
it to indulge those feelings

20:04     
i've been too busy to develop those
hostilities
and i've had a wonderful luck in meeting
fascinating people and having wonderful
students
year in and year out and so the amount
of
satisfaction is huge and
it would be a very selfish thing to
blame anybody for the for anything else
you've also said that you've really
never been lonely for a moment in your
life that's true
i've never had that experience describe
your conversion to roman catholicism in
1938 as a long
pilgrimage and a solitary one done
