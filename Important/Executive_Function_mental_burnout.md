"Executive dysfunction is a symptom that happens with conditions that disrupt your brain’s ability to control thoughts, emotions and behavior. It’s common with conditions like ADHD, but can also happen due to brain damage or degenerative brain diseases. Depending on why it happens, it may be treatable with medications, psychotherapy or both."

"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action."

hallucinations, believing fiction as reality. Russian information warfare outcomes are people being addicted to fiction and unverified information, repulsed by authentic sincere sources of knowledge and teaching.

MAGA and Donald Trump is extreme egomania values. And mental health professionals all across the world have not been preparing for the cult deprogramming and treatment.

It's possible someone could use the Internet and rapidly prepare a treatment plan for #MAGA cult to anti-reality. It is essential to study Russian information warfare that originated back in year 2013 and was documented and written about in year 2014
