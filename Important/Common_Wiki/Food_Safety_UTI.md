# Food Safety UTI

A new study estimates that nearly one in five urinary tract infections in Southern California may be caused by E. coli strains transmitted through contaminated meat – and pose a hidden foodborne risk to millions of people not just in California but across the US. The research, published in mBio, also found that people living in low-income neighborhoods are at the greatest risk.

“Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem,” said Lance B. Price, senior author of the study and professor of environmental and occupational health at the George Washington University.

“This opens up new avenues for prevention, especially for vulnerable communities that bear a disproportionate burden. This is why we should be investing more, not less, in research about the social determinants of health. Your risk of infection should not depend on your ZIP code.” Price is also the founding director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at the GW Milken Institute School of Public Health.

UTIs are among the most common infections worldwide, disproportionately affecting women and the elderly. They cost billions annually in medical care and lost productivity. E. coli, the leading cause of UTIs, is also a common contaminant in raw poultry and meat – but until now, it’s been difficult to estimate how often foodborne strains cause infections in people.
