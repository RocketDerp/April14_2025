1. Humanity already had World War One, World War Two, Ukraine War since 2014, Information Warfare lost since 2013

2. Humanity has not solved the religion conflicts of fiction vs. nonfiction. The metaphor crisis.

3. Repeating and repeating and reminding and getting everyone on same page, the annoyance, "too preachy" barrier of egoism, reminding together.

6. Global pandemic of December 2019 onward touched us person to person, peer to peer, and we did not treat it as such. There was no poetry and teachers of spiritual that here we had an event that every person had neighbors die from a disease that originated in the airports of Wuhan, China. And the experience was not grasped. Nor did the clergy have a world wide wake / funeral to say thank-you to all the medical doctors, hospital staff, essential workers who helped us out. Why did it not happen... some famous clergy of some place in the world organize a day to say goodbye and celebrate the lives of those who died in medical isolation?

7. When things get serious and bad, wars break out. When does **important, be serious, halt entertainment and mocking** ever break out in humanity? When do people gather at public libraries instead of military weapon distribution points? When do we turn to intellect and better ideas in serious focus - instead of turning plowshares into swords? When do we have alarms of mob mentality, mass psychosis events? When do we have "fire drills" for mob mentality outbreaks, terrorism cult outbreaks? When do mental health workers of the world unite to rescue people from a war? [When do we Stop All Entertainment and do cram sessions of learning for common sense, common same-page understanding?](../Grim_Blunt/Stop_All_Entertainment.md) - why did we all not dust off books about the year 1918 pandemic ("Spanish Flu") in January 2025 for 3 days? Why did we not type in quotes from books, photocopy book pages, memorize author names? When terrorism broke out October 7, 2023 in Palestine, why did we not all shut down globally and dust off Malala's words from her book a decade earlier about reforming Islam and terrorism and declare that everyone needs to put a stop to war and hate? Why are we not even TRYING to take the "high roads"?

### James Joyce of Dublin Ireland

Joyce had a sense that language wasn't working, page 3 of Finnegans Wake and the Tower of Babel in the thunderword. 

If we can't communicate compasson and love thorugh langauge, if we can't end wars and conflicts through langauge, we are suffering at our own egoism. Gorup egomania, mob mentality. Our language conflicts of not grasping a common goodness and being attracted to Putin and Donald Trump and Hitler and other terrible systems. [MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M)

The James Joyce's themes of "Earwocker", earworm, and what we latch on to and what we repeat in our minds. And even what we repeat of aquired media with intention of repeating, such as Sunday Church and Islamic prayer patterns daily.
