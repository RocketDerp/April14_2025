Editing,, organizing what alraedy written.

Less capture.

Alas, things are very very grim. Charlie Kirk mythology is very very dark, anti-light.

Checkpoint...

So just the last Git commits are interesting to me off Reddit /r/All

1. Joke-washing of Charlie Kirk, mythological monomyth. Hate "trigger the snowflakes', "own the libs", "own the peole Russia mind-fucked", "own MAGA", "own the left"

2. Bible inveted, Bible remedial literacy not taken seriously or claled for, just mocking "the conservatives" instead of any desire to rescue or turn around the USA from bad literacy, self-harm

3. Absence, silloute void: people saying too much mob mentality, too much high-speed ractionary, too much nut picking and avoidance of chery-picking.

Grim grim grim that We The People hate that Kamala wrote a book on paper with organized ideas instead of Trump A.I. films and images. Last night Github commits

Am I going to read the book? No. But I will go now and look for quotes

### Pencil and pens

Oh yha, this kind of headline is exactly the chekcpoint. People all flocking to *hate harder*,*violence harder*, attitudes that the USA should abandon books and pens.

"DNC chair says he's tired of Democrats bringing 'pencil to a knife fight'"

The horrible fantasy that people think there was a "taken high road". Who asserted love? Who asserted Bible verse "1 John 3:17" to Trump Bible, MAGA chistians? Nobody, that is who! There was no high road taken, *hate harder* is the further path of the low road that people alrady were on since IRA year 2013. Road gets longer as Malala said at MLK Jr's Church.

People did not call out for compassion reform, Bible literacy lessons for the clergy. October 7, 2023 should have been ANOTHER reminder of Mosque clergy needing reform. But instaed, it's all been about violence and hate. Teams of flags  hate the other flags.

The USA since year 2013 by looking at Pakistan / Malala, would have seen what Russia was feeding with the IRA and CA since year 2013. Extreme hate, not extreme compassion.

Snarky pro-Russia bullshit. Pencils to a gun fight. You bring cult deprogramming to a cult. You bring mental health workers of cults.
