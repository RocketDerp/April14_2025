Editing,, organizing what alraedy written.

Less capture.

Alas, things are very very grim. Charlie Kirk mythology is very very dark, anti-light.

Checkpoint...

So just the last Git commits are interesting to me off Reddit /r/All

1. Joke-washing of Charlie Kirk, mythological monomyth. Hate "trigger the snowflakes', "own the libs", "own the peole Russia mind-fucked", "own MAGA", "own the left"

2. Bible inveted, Bible remedial literacy not taken seriously or claled for, just mocking "the conservatives" instead of any desire to rescue or turn around the USA from bad literacy, self-harm
