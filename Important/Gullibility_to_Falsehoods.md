I thought people misunderstood autism - but after witnessing the past 18 months with Donald Trump in USA, I see the far deeper problem is everyday people think Donald Trump is honest, sincere, factual, accurate. The gullibility to falsehoods is huge crisis.

&nbsp;

I thought people were having trouble understanding climate science, earth sciences, how burning gasoline all over the Earth was warming up the earth with 8 billion people.

But now I see in USA that the problem is much more severe. People trust Donald Trump. People believe Donald Trump is accurate with information. No matter what Trump says, people believe it in USA.

USA society can't tell the most obviously incorrect and wrong person is not a good source of information. Gullibility in everyday American people is the problem. Everyday people in USA think Donald Trump is factual and correct. The gullible USA is hundreds of millions of people every day on every topic!

&nbsp;

My use of English, my language, may seem unusual and broken to people

But my god, hundred of millions of people in United States of America think Donald Trump's language is excellent and trustworthy!  People are so gullible in USA that they believe and trust Donald Trump is accurate and factual. No wonder so many people with autism, autistic persons, are so bewildered.

When an entire society thinks Donald Trump at age 79 is accurate for information, what chance does a 23 year old person with autism have? When everyone in USA society treats Donald Trump as hilarious and funny - something is very sick with EACH and EVERY PERSON in the world who isn't alarmed and disturbed that a liar is being trusted by everyone around them!

Of all the people in the United States of America, people trust Donald Trump above all else for the future of their children. Gullibility of social media consumers is horrific and terrible! People trust RFK Jr too, it is out of control how gullible every person in USA has become.

&nbsp;

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released to the public. Since 1985, I had experienced showing ELIZA chatbot to everyday people and the level of gullibility. 

I was alarmed when people trusted ChatGPT in year 2023. But really these past 18 months, since January 2024 - how all the people in the United States of America are not screaming in alarm that trusting Donald Trump is a huge mistake. The gullibility is horrific in USA August 2025. It was terrible and awful in January 2024 and all year 2024, but year 2025 (this year) the gullible people in USA is unlike any in all world history. Trusting RFK Jr and Donald Trump is a massive sign of problems. Trusting ChatGPT on a computer screen in year 2023 is one thing, but believing Donald Trump is accurate and factual in August 2025 is a sickness I can't even describe! Every person in USA is suffering from extreme gullibility, how can they trust Donald Trump? That's the worst person to trust in all human history, he gets facts and information incorrect every hour of every day!

Diary Of RoundSparrow. Sunday. Bible Day. Levant Bible Day.

Here in United States of America, people will trust and believe Donald Trump as long as they can LOL LMAO on their social machines at South Park. You can be a 79 year old man with terrible information skills and confusion over facts and accuracy, and as long as people have South Park they accept the situation.

People all around me in the USA are so gullible and drunk on humor memes and South Park comedy that they don't see the massive errors, mistakes, comprehension problems of RFK Jr and Donald Trump and other people leading the United States of America. People with the worst possible skills are worshiped as accurate, factual, correct sources of information. USA is a very very very very very very sick nation in the head to be so gullible. It is extremely alarming, extremely disturbing in August 2025 that people trust and believe Donald Trump and RFK Jr.

&nbsp;

People in USA are so gullible to computer screens, TV screens, people leading them with information. People trust Donald Trump is accurate and comprehends facts and figures. We The People are entirely broken in August 2025 to think Donald Trump is a source of accurate and correct information.

People are attracted to fiction and falsehoods.

## the Actor makeup

The gullibility people have over Trump that everything he does is an accident / mistake / dumb / idiot / stupid. I think that's part of why he likes the orange facial makeup. It makes it clear that he is an actor, a performer, putting on performance art. People fall for, addictions to hate.

Trump does not TRY to avoid behaving dumb, mixing up language, gesturing in usual ways. Because he knows it gets him in the popular press. Trump has studied casinos and media for the sake of understanding how people are driven to mocking and insulting. Predictable responses of a casino customer. He wasn't owner for profit as a businessman, Trump uses casinos for experiments in entertainment an to study people's predictability. Trump's power is bullying people, tricking people, making people follow him around like he is on The Truman Show in a dome of cameras.

It works. People can not resist the hate that Trump prizes. Hate leadership gets hate following. People become addicted to the hate and mocking Trump cultivates.

Trump has been in Reality TV an met many stars. He knows professionals put makeup on before they face the public. He is manipulating people with hate, he deliberately does it, he realized how people react to it long long ago.

Anti-science looks like fiction addition.   
If a map creates fiction, Trump likes the artificial reality    

People think they have a "gotcha" that Greenland isn't as big as on maps. No, Donald Trump doesn't care because fandom of Donald  Trump doesn't care. Trump is not a person concerned with science and reality. Trump is a fiction storyteller. Fiction outsells nonfiction.
