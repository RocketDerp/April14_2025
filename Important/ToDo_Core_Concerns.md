Front page of Reddit promoting rape and violence against women:

Mind rot, that people "pretend" in communications. That men don't murder women far more often than women murder men. That physical abuse by men and even structural systemic abuse by men, and even racial abuse by men of other races isn't a reality all over the world. And that women in Unite States of America behave the same in New York City vs. Fort Wayne, Indiana or Pueblo, Colorado. Let alone how a woman in Japan vs. woman in USA vs. woman in Algeria. That people don't make mistakes with language and understanding and magically rape and violence overcomes the communications barriers. Like in the Zobie song, violence causes silence.  Also that elderly women, such as Nick Fuentes's mother or grandmother or others - are secretly wanting vilence. There are so many complexities that are just being abandoned in favor of media / podcast / broadcast desk media-think. Like it is fiction character in Raging Bull 1980 (media enviornment / media star boxer) film. https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-raging-bull-1980
