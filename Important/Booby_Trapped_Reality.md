# Booby-Trapped Reality

Living in a society where neighbors and friends trick and outsmart you or labor in advance to create illusions or exploit traditions and expectations. Terrorism cultures where people know you will be attending Church on Sunday or Mosque on Friday or a music concert and set bombs or gun attacks. Examples: [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Arena_bombing), [Moscow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocus_City_Hall_attack), [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_nightclub_shooting), [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks).
