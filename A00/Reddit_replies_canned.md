This particular media venue is not a place I can respond to you on these topics. When baited like you have baited me, my information will be reported and result in removal. It has happened again and again since year 2015. And I am far from the only person experiencing this. If you really want to discuss the points, we have to find a media venue other than the one we are currently using.  I have been documenting this topic removal situation on another media venue.
