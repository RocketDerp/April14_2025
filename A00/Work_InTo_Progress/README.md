"The first extract of what was to become Finnegans Wake (1939) was published in April 1924 in the short-lived journal The Transatlantic Review, edited by Ford Madox Ford. This was a version of what is now Part II, Chapter 4 of the book, pages 383-399. It deal with “Mamalujo” (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), the four evangelists, old men who are historians, like the Four Masters, and chroniclers. They are also the four provinces of Ireland. They are tired, ancient, jealous of the young, and also very boring in their rambling recollections of the past. (Some would say that Joyce was rather too successful in conveying the boring quality of their discourse.)"

"Joyce was determined not to give the book’s title away until the very last minute, so Ford gave the passage the name “Extract from A Work in Progress.” Joyce liked the term, and it became the working title for the book during the many subsequent years before it finally appeared. Most of Finnegans Wake had already appeared in print by the time it was published in book form in 1939 by Faber & Faber. Most of the earlier parts of the work had been published in installments, either in magazines or as short books or pamphlets."
