“Professionalism merges the individual into patterns of total environment. Amateurism seeks the development of the total awareness of the individual and the critical awareness of the groundrules of society. The amateur can afford to lose.”
— Marshall McLuhan https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/

“Professionalism is environmental. Amateurism is anti-environmental.”
— book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel. It was published in March 1967

“The poet, the artist, the sleuth—whoever sharpens our perception tends to be antisocial; rarely “well adjusted,” he cannot go along with currents and trends.”
— Marshall McLuhan https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/

“This need to interface, to confront environments with a certain antisocial power, is manifest in the famous story, “The Emperor’s New Clothes.” “Well-adjusted” courtiers, having vested interests, saw the Emperor as beautifully appointed. The “antisocial” brat, unaccustomed to the old environment, clearly saw that the Emperor “ain’t got nothin’ on.” **The new environment** was clearly visible to him.”
— Marshall McLuhan https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/

Apply that to George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): BILL MOYERS: Do you think there was such a place as the Garden of Eden?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Of course not. The Garden of Eden is **a metaphor** for that innocence that is innocent of time, innocent of opposites, and that is the prime center out of which consciousness then becomes aware of the changes. BILL MOYERS: But if there is in the idea of Eden this innocence, what happens to it? Isn’t it shaken, dominated, and corrupted by fear? CAMPBELL: That’s it.
