“Professionalism merges the individual into patterns of total environment. Amateurism seeks the development of the total awareness of the individual and the critical awareness of the groundrules of society. The amateur can afford to lose.”
— Marshall McLuhan https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/

“Professionalism is environmental. Amateurism is anti-environmental.”
— book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel. It was published in March 1967

“The poet, the artist, the sleuth—whoever sharpens our perception tends to be antisocial; rarely “well adjusted,” he cannot go along with currents and trends.”
— Marshall McLuhan https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/
