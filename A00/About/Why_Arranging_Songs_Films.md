# Why Arranging Songs And Films

Marshall McLuhan's 1968 book "War and Peace in the Global Village" is clip-art focused. Collage art. James Joyce was *popular enough*.

* "critics **who were most appreciative of Ulysses** are complaining about my new work. They cannot understand it. Therefore they say it is meaningless. Now if it were meaningless it could be written quickly without thought, without pains, without erudition; but I assure you that these 20 pages now before us \[i.e., chapter I.8\] cost me twelve hundred hours and an enormous expense of spirit." - James Joyce

The Constitution is ideals on a level of the entire world. The Bill of Rights is ideals on the level of the entire world. **The Tower of Babel** is essential comprehension when addressing or sharing the entire planet Earth. The Tower of Babel metaphor is conflicts within our own brain over understanding and comprehending the outside real-world and crunching it down into written or spoken languages.

The Founding Fathers encountered languages never seen in Europe! The First Peoples / Native Americans had ideas, concepts, language, metaphors entirely different from what these men had encountered. The Bible, imported from the Levant, had no description of plants, animals, people, geography of North America.

# Singsong 

So how a person relates to a popular song of even a slightly different decade, a 1980's song such as..

1. "Keep Your Hands to Yourself" - year 1987 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WonOudGMSdc


Can people even relate to the very opening words? Coins are rare in the day of credit cards and smartphone payment systems. Further, even if you know what coins in a man's pant pocket (women tended to not have pockets for coins and instead use clutch / purses)... is the meaning of *social change* in my pocket, sexual liberation changes overloaded meaning... or age threshold of a lifetime adulthood changes? Parenting and pregnancy?

How can we be expected to understand the Levant Bible from 2,000 years ago if we can't even understand life situations in language from year 1987? This song was number 35 in USA sales https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1987 - so it was somewhat known. Released November 1986.


Hence, James Joyce, hence Marshall McLuhan's Canadian 1968 book "War and Peace in the Global Village" about 1939 Finnegans Wake.

2. "Land of Confusion" - year 1987 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq7FKO5DlV0

The song was released as the album's fourth single on November 17, 1986.
