# On Reddit

Almost all the things I have to say bout Reddit I have to say about Lemmy. When the API change came the year of ChaatpGPT / Q1 2023, I invested a lot of time into analyzing Lemmy.

People set up thousands of Lemmy servers... yet nobody wanted to fix the PostgreSQL optimization and scale problems. Lemmy . ml was nonstop crashing with the Reddit inrush. 

Beyond the technical, the no-identity prizing of hate and prizing of anti-Wiki...

The abandonment of topics, the "timing window" of topics is still pretty much the same on Lemmy and Reddit. Recency focus.

Culture of: Anti-Wiki. Anti-FAQ. Constant desires and attachment to just the most recent hours of postings.

So the "corporate" owners issue addressee none of this issue with Lemmy.

1. Hate of Reddit motivates Lemmy users in Q1 2023 onward, much like hate of Twitter motivated November 2024 onward Bluesky.

2. Left vs. right brainrot. There is no pro-Malala year 2013 onward values. No desire for world peace. cynical clever is prized

3. No sense of history with Usenet and lessons learned of free open systems like Usenet that came before. Topic-specific like Reddit and Lemmy.

4. No sense of saving the world from hate and Tower of Babel conflicts.

Ukraine war topic battleground of manipulation. Anti-humanism anti-goodness tone.

Beehaw is one exception of goodness itself prized, goodness ideals. But had to break ties with other Lemmmy instances.

This writing on this page is incomplete and unedited as almost always these days. It doesn't reflect my thinking and ideals as much as my brain damaged Tower of Babel battle wounds.
