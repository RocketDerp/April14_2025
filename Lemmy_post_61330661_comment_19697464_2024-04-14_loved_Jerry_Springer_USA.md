> Trump’s outrageous lies and showmanship appeals to his cult members who loved Jerry Springer, and other idiotic reality TV clowns. They love it.

True, from year 2014 to year 2023... but starting in year 2024 the cult of *hate Trump* and *hate Musk* grew even more potent. Since January 2024, the entire USA in inside the 5,000 Kremlin ***alternate reality screen games*** on Lemmy, Bluesky, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (Elon Musk X), Newsmax, Fox News, TikTok, *you name it*, people hate Americans.

It's all about who **hates the hardest** of Americans hating Americans and self-destructing the USA in media cult behaviors.

Surkov won, Russia won. Do Americans hate North Americans, oh yha, April 2025!! ANYTHING but use intelligence, teaching, education, study, comprehension and thinking to resist Russia!

Since March 2013, there were 5,000 media cult patterns deployed to Reddit, Twitter, news comment sections, etc. It's widespread. Cults and reactionary counter-cults / anti-cults to the other cults.

*"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare". It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare.* ***It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations*** *that then translate into political action."* - ["Russia and the Menace of Unreality", "How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare".
