Long-form scratch pad / dumping ground.

Many of this is extremely raw product of brain damage attempting to express ideas. Not edited, not spell checked, serious problems with language brain issues.

Isn't that kind of suspect that the Unique cloners decreased after I added NSA / goverment intelligence agency content in [A00 subdirectory](A00)? Hummm....

Paranoid if they aren't out to get you / [We The People (Great Seal Eye)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Winner), right? Suspect some sandboxing and alteration of transaction accounting records [‚Ä¶ ùÑû üé∏](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4RDB-mMDJg) *Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?* ‚Ä¶ "I was lecturing once at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington on Hindu mythology, sociology, and politics. There‚Äôs a saying in the Hindu book of politics that the ruler must hold in one hand the weapon of war, the big stick, and in the other the peaceful sound of the [*song*](https://www.ulysseswhiskey.com/post/james-joyce-s-love-for-music-is-intricately-woven-into-the-fabric-of-ulysses) of cooperative action. And there I was, standing with my two hands like this, and everybody in the room laughed. I couldn‚Äôt understand. And then they began pointing. I looked back, and here was this picture of the eagle (bird) hanging on the wall behind my head in just the same posture that I was in." - summer of 1987, age 83, Joseph Campbell, Skywalker Ranch. ‚Ä¶ RoundSparrow ‚Ä¶ "the father doesn‚Äôt want to feed a mere bird, so he kills it. And the legend says the man killed the bird, and with the bird he killed the **song**, and with the song, himself. He dropped dead, completely dead, and was dead forever." ‚Ä¶ "it‚Äôs not the mythology of a special revelation. The Hindus, for example, don‚Äôt believe in special revelation. They speak of a state in which the **ears** (Earwicker) have opened to the **song** of the universe. Here the eye has opened to the radiance of the mind of God. And that‚Äôs a *fundamental* **deist** idea. Once *you* reject the idea of the Fall in the Garden, man is not cut off from his source. Now back to the Great Seal."
