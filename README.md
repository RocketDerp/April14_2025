[… 𝄞 🎸](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4RDB-mMDJg) *Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?* … "One day in 1986 his supervisor asked him to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents in the computer usage accounts. Stoll traced the error to an unauthorized user who had apparently used nine seconds of computer time" … "I was lecturing once at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington on Hindu mythology, sociology, and politics.

And that’s a *fundamental* **deist** idea. Once *you* reject the idea of the Fall in the Garden, man is not cut off from his source. Now back to the Great Seal."
