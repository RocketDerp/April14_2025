* "Il avait fait alors une grande démonstration de sa découverte à un Congrès International d'Astronomie. Mais personne ne l'avait cru à cause de son costume.

"Being illiterate in the processes of any medium (language) leaves one at the mercy of those who control it. The new media — these new languages — then are among the most important "subjects" to be studied in the interests of survival." - Neil Postman on media ecology

[… 𝄞 🎸](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4RDB-mMDJg) *Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?* … "One day in 1986 his supervisor asked him to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents in the computer usage accounts. Stoll traced the error to an unauthorized user who had apparently used nine seconds of computer time" … "I was lecturing once at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington on Hindu mythology, sociology, and politics. There’s a saying in the Hindu book of politics that the ruler must hold in one hand the weapon of war, the big stick, and in the other the peaceful sound of the [*song*](https://www.ulysseswhiskey.com/post/james-joyce-s-love-for-music-is-intricately-woven-into-the-fabric-of-ulysses) of cooperative action. And there I was, standing with my two hands like this, and everybody in the room laughed. I couldn’t understand. And then they began pointing. I looked back, and here was this picture of the eagle (bird) hanging on the wall behind my head in just the same posture that I was in." - summer of 1987, age 83, Joseph Campbell, Skywalker Ranch. … RoundSparrow … "the father doesn’t want to feed a mere bird, so he kills it. And the legend says the man killed the bird, and with the bird he killed the **song**, and with the song, himself. He dropped dead, completely dead, and was dead forever." … "it’s not the mythology of a special revelation. The Hindus, for example, don’t believe in special revelation. They speak of a state in which the **ears** (Earwicker) have opened to the **song** of the universe. Here the eye has opened to the radiance of the mind of God. And that’s a *fundamental* **deist** idea. Once *you* reject the idea of the Fall in the Garden, man is not cut off from his source. Now back to the Great Seal."

* "the audience was being conditioned to get its information faster, in a way that was less nuanced and, of course, **image-based**. As my father pointed out, a written sentence has a level of verifiability to it: it is true or not true – or, at the very least, we can have a meaningful discussion over its truth. (This was pre-truthiness, pre-“alternative facts”.) But **an image**? One never says **a picture** is true or false. It either captures your attention or it doesn’t." - Andrew Postman.

* “For instance, on the planet Earth, man had **always** assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much — the wheel, New York, **wars and so on** — whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man — for precisely the same reasons.” ― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Fiction.
* * "Now, the **biblical tradition** is a socially oriented mythology. Nature is condemned. In the nineteenth century, scholars thought of mythology and ritual as an attempt to control nature. But that is magic, not mythology or religion. Nature religions are not attempts to control nature but to help you put yourself in accord with it. But when nature is thought of as evil, you don’t put yourself in accord with it, you control it, or try to, and **hence the tension, the anxiety, the cutting down of forests, the annihilation of native people**. And the accent here separates us from nature." - Age 87. Published year 1988. Nonfiction.
