# Peer Pressure Values

in year 2012 and 2013, with her October 8, 2013 book and earlier fame... what I witness is Malala connected with MLK Jr and others.

Why are we, humanity, all the people of the world - not makinga list of values of goodness? And exceptions and understandings?

Why does it have to be wrappped in fiction storytelling of god / gods that we fight over? 

Elif's 40 rules of Love.

Why are we not making named lists of values we wish to share in? Not laws, but desires and notes and teaching?
