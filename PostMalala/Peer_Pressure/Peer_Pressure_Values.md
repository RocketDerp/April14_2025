# Peer Pressure Value

in year 2012 and 2013, with her October 8, 2013 book and earlier fame... what I witness is Malala connected with MLK Jr and others.

Why are we, humanity, all the people of the world - not makinga list of values of goodness? And exceptions and understandings?

Why does it have to be wrappped in fiction storytelling of god / gods that we fight over?
