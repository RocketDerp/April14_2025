"Frantz Fanon discusses clothing as weaponry in Studies in a Dying Colonialism:

The body of the young Algerian woman, in traditional society, is revealed to her
by its coming to maturity and by the veil. The veil covers the body and disciplines it, tempers it, at the very time when it experiences its phase of greatest effervescence. The veil protects, reassures,
isolates. One must have heard the confessions of Algerian women or have analyzed the dream content of certain
recently unveiled women to appreciate the importance of the veil for the body of the woman. Without the veil she has an impression of her body being cut up into bits, put adrift; the limbs seem to lengthen indefinitely. When the Algerian woman has to cross the street, for along time she commits errors of judgment as to the exact distance to be negotiated. The unveiled body seems to escape, to dissolve. She has an impression of being improperly dressed,even of being naked. She experiences
a sense of incompleteness with great
intensity. She has the anxious feeling
that something is unfinished, and along
with this a frightful sensation of disintegrating. The absence of the veil distorts
the Algerian woman's corporal pattern.
She quickly has to invent new dimensions for her body, new means of muscular control. She has to create for
herself an attitude of unveiled-woman outside. She must overcome all timidity,
all awkwardness (for she must pass for a European), and at the same time be
careful not to overdo it, not to attract notice to herself. The Algerian woman
who walks stark naked into a European
city relearns her body, re-establishes it in a totally revolutionary fashion. This
new dialectic of the body and of the
world is primary in the case of **one
revolutionary woman**.

At a quite different level, Africans attempting to acquire literacy have found it expedient to wear European costume for the
simple reason that it retains a great deal
more bodily heat and energy than their
native costume. **The act of reading printed
matter drains off a huge proportion of
the human energy**, as any convalescent knows."
