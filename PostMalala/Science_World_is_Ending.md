“The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013

The abandonment of nonfiction in favor of science fiction Qurn storytelling.

It's memes and Truth Social / Fox News / Radio Mullah over nonfiction learning.

Antics and bullying, and dramatic punishment shooting on the school bus of a domestic Muslim girl for reading the wrong books (science books) and criticizing the elderly Taliban leaders.

The world had a warning in 2012 shooting and 2013 book, and the world didn't want to repeat and focus on the teachings of Malala since January 2009... the teachings of Donald Trump about the se show in Moscow November 8, 2013 became the sustained focus of attention and admriation for education and learning. 

Memes are adult education, Fox News adult education, Reddit adult education, Bluesky adult education, Elon Musk Twitter adult eduation.
