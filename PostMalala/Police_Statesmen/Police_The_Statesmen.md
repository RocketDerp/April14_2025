# Police The Statesmen 

Who Watches the Watchers?    
Who Polices the Statesmen?    
We The People must educate and teach and stand up to the Taliban states!   

Malala may not always see as clearly as she did in October year 2013, but her published words live on in printed book she shared with the world on her book tour.

Mecca is a police state. Who watches the Iran clergy Police Statesmen?     
Who watches the Talib States?    

We The People, *Pluribus*, All of Us! Mutual concern, interest is mutual to study and analyze Malala's October 8, 2013 book and teachings. Of course, no book is perfect! No book supremacy. { Bible, Torah, Quran, Book of Mormon, L Ron Hubbard books } - all books have errors and flaws, no perfect book, no *book supremacy*.

Pale Blue Dot, Earth Pride, Police Statesmen of Mecca and Everywhere, We The People, All of Us, *Pluribus*.

* "and that there were now, furthermore, no less than six apexes, one above, one below, and four (so to say) to the four quarters. The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that **anybody from any quarter** can speak, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions and then speak. So what you have here on the dollar bill is the eagle representing this wonderful image of the way in which the transcendent manifests itself in the world. That's what the United States is founded on. If you're going to govern properly, you've got to govern from the apex of the triangle, in the sense of the world eye at the top."

Malala spoke, from the mouth of babes, January 3, 2009. And she spoke on her October year 2013 book tour.    
"I think the people of America, the United States"     

"I think we have a common want and desire"

October 10, 2013 is before October 7, 2023. Suffering from terrorism. Suffering from the cultural norms and traditions.
