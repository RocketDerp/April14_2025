1. October 2013 Malala's book and the lack of enthusiasm in emotionally and intellectually cheer-leading and giving lip service / name-drop to Malala. Even in February 2026, Malala isn't even on Bluesky and using Twitter still and people don't notice.

2. Access Hollywood October 7, 2016 - a month before election and how people behaved in not supporting women, and the implications of famous celebrity and stars doing whatever they want.

3. Epstein July 2025.

4. Billionaires and power to abuse in so many ways.

Going back to my experience of the Arab Spring being Tunisia and Algeria first generation of middle class university educated women who were able to read and write in multiple languages and have unrestricted access to the naked Internet and news systems of year 2009, 2010, 2011 and how that idealism got tossed. And how people used BBS systems and Internet (Usenet, etc) until Big Commercial Internet of Reddit / Facebook / Twitter became the normal like huge TV network empires.
