# ToDo: Avoided topics top 13

Create top 13 list of the things people are avoiding

Vince Gilligan's February 15, 2025 statement about listening

People are speaking but not listing, people are writing without reading.  
People are not connecting what they are writing and saying as common issues.  

1. Morality of Billionaires sucking up all the money is not being connected to Bible verse "1 John 3:17". This isn't an issue of { Faith, Believe } it is an issue of literacy and teaching Bible literacy. Which we ALL benefit from, We The People benefit from good Bible reading
2. Morality of Billionaires sucking all the oxygen out of the room. Advertising marking, armies of insincere social media pariticpation users paid or loyal or brainwash by billionaires (brand loyalty to products or services, such as Apple tV+ or Apple music store)
3. Jen Senko ignored, and people need to face it head on. 2015 and 2016 timeline
4. Ted K quote 2015
5. Normal Putin, Normal Russia. Putin is a billionaire. He isn't an elected politician. He was blessed and appointed by Yeltson. He is a King. King Putin billionaire. Getting wealth and power like a king is how he rules Russia. It isn't democracy like USA 1990.
6. Billionaires own sports teams. Entertaining games, gaming, gamers. Sports, games. Team owners. FIFA Peace Prize. Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl. Own audiences, own fandoms.

7. Democracy does not work **without love**. "Hate One Another" is a terrorism state. September 11, 2001 experience brushed under the rug, 9/11 forgotten. "Hate One Another" is not democracy, it's brutality and terrorist monster state. OPERA_A Without Love of Neighbors, USA is shit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4tJSn0QtME 22,488,086 views September 1, 2010

8. Media addicts say Elon Musk, richest person in world, following Putin was { stupid, idiot, dumb, loss of money and power } in Twitter purchase. A complete failure to grasp Marshall McLuhan. https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1nyw3du/the_purchase_of_twitter_paid_off_massively_for/
    * The **medium is the message. The Twitter is the message** of mind-fuck. University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan teaching abandoned in favor of addicts to Reddit and Facebook and Twitter. Russia: https://www.BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 proved it with people not able to face that August 24, 2018 before December COVID-2019.

# Democracy does not work

Without love, it's competitive domination.  
Marriage without love is business workplace, office work. 
Parenting without love shows. You can see the outcomes of people without love. 

People are willing to stand up and die for oil, businessmen, profits. Military dies for land conquest. It is a PROVEN human behavior all over the world. Make a list. Seriously, make a list of what world wars have been fraught about.  

People will not die for love, compassion, world peace. People think you are dumb idiot to fly over to North Korea from USA and try to make friends and are murdered / raped / killed. People think it is dumb to go into a war zone with flowers an olive branches. You will be mocked.

To go to Vietnam from USA and murder and kill, You will be called the greatest persons, the hero, a killing who murdered strangers and dies for murder and killing is praised. If you have PTSD / CPTSD from murdering people you will get a parade. But if you get PTSD from trying to spread love and compassion without a weapon system in your hand, you will be { shunned, abused, mocked, insulted, condemned, dumb, idiot, stupid } for standng up for world peace.

This is why we don't have world peace! We praise killers with weapon systems. We condemn people willing to die for peace and goodness. To sacrifice for world war is cheered, to sacrifice for

2 + 2 is on mind

2 + 2 is on my mind

To sacrifice for cooperate profits, for corporate leaders, praised. Die for a job, take risks.  
TO sacrifice for world peace and feeding all people on earth is mocked insulted abused.   

We keep doing this. It isn't just "we" in the USA who behaves this way.

When is the last time you saw a North Korean or Russian come to USA and talk us into world peace and goodness? Not for profit of selling musk an being a celebrity?

This is what we learned with world wars.   
We all hate humans. We all hate people. We are in a gridlock planet Earth of hate.  
The world we live on, Earth, is populated with people who hate people

2 + 2 is on my mind

We have factories to make killing weapon systems.   
We have standing armies ready at any moment to murder and kill.   
We have no mental health professionals to calm people down, tell them to love one another, and say that hugging is what people need, breaking bread together, cooking together, pot-luck party.
We add military guns to stress. We add stress to stress.

That is the planet of human beings, Earth, over 8 billion people who think investing more in military and weapon systems and training to kill and murder and drone development of killing systems....

2 + 2 is on my mind     
Check the date that song was published, and so many avoid the lyrics and words    

February 28, 1954 - it all got solved. The entire planet Earth hates each other.   
February 28, 1954. The math got completed.    
Japan people did not know USA people, but killed them with machine weapon systems. Perl Harbor.   
We all hate humans on Planet Earth. It is team-sports of teams of hate.   

I don't find nay of it fun.  
I think it sucks.  
I think people are abusive and monsters to humans on Earth.  
I think people will sign up to be a killer murder an go to murdering school military training.   
I think that is fact and you can count the money spent on murder school, killing school, and you can count the dead and injured.   
I think people find it fun to murder school and wage war and kill humans over egomania nd egoism.   
I find it sucks, I do not enjoy it at all. This earth is full of gunmen and training schools for terrorism and military.   

People are not willing to die for olive branches, peace, poetry, songs.   
People consider it smart and intelligent to die for military service to killing and murder.   

I'm not talking about USA military, I'm talking about thee history of the whole planet Earth. For 4,000 years and Roman Empire, Ottoman Empire, spread of Islamic religion. People aren't spreading love to Pakistan, they are spreading murder and killing and weapon systems.

Malala spread authentic love since **January 3, 2009 on her blog on WWW**. And she got a murder bullet military in her face. Her friends were shot too on the same school bus. Anti-learning, pro-murder pro-killing humans. Swat Valley Pakistan in the name of Quran Islam religion from a book that is FAR away from Pakistan. Trace the distance of Mecca to Pakistan. Do it. Year 635, how long would it take to carry a book from Saudi Arabia Mecca to Swat Valley Pakistani using year 635 travel routs 

Islam is the newest of the new religions. Newer than Hindu, newer than Christian, newer than Jewish. Its' the new religion! Year 635, how long would it take to carry a book from Saudi Arabia Mecca to Swat Valley Pakistani using year 635 travel routs and transpiration machines.
