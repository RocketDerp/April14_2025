Divorce / freedom to have children without marriage in the first place. Child custody conflicts.

People are conditioned in USA to not solve problems, but to be social media block-happy / prison-happy / jail-happy / video game banhammer-happy.  ALl of which amplifies the underlying conflicts by never learning or understanding.

People didn't come to terms what Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Internet Research Agency were doing in year 2013 in USA - because people are emotionally and mentally inexperienced at sticking / persisting on subjects until they are understood. Instead, people prize conflcits and domination (prison, jail, "owning the libs", "leopards eat MAGA faces, ha ha ocking"). The anti-progress comes from an avoidance of mental and emotional progress itself in society. Move away to another state after divorce. Hit the gym, block the phone, bmock the social media, jail the conflict / prison walls / blocking social media walls.

The hippy movement / Woodstock 1969 behaviors were coming together, not pushing apart. Humanism inward experience,not prison / jail / blocking via telephone and armed millitant police force.
