# USA Prison Population

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate

Divorce / freedom to have children without marriage in the first place. Child custody conflicts.

People are conditioned in USA to not solve problems, but to be social media block-happy / prison-happy / jail-happy / video game banhammer-happy.  All of which amplifies the underlying conflicts by never learning or understanding.

People didn't come to terms what Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Internet Research Agency were doing in year 2013 in USA - because people are emotionally and mentally inexperienced at sticking / persisting on subjects until they are understood. Instead, people prize conflicts and domination (prison, jail, "owning the libs", "leopards eat MAGA faces, ha ha mocking"). The anti-progress comes from an avoidance of mental and emotional progress itself in society. Move away to another state after divorce. Hit the gym, block the phone, block the social media, jail the conflict / prison walls / blocking social media walls.

The hippy movement / Woodstock 1969 behaviors were coming together, not pushing apart. Humanism inward experience,not prison / jail / blocking via telephone and armed militant police force.

# We Must Surely Be Learning

Release date: 22 November 1968

I look at the world and I notice it's turning   
While my guitar gently weeps   
With every mistake we must surely be learning  
Still my guitar gently weeps  

I don't know how you were diverted  
You were perverted too   
I don't know how you were inverted  
No-one alerted you  

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping   
While my guitar gently weeps   
Look at you all......
