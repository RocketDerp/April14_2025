# Expectation of War and Insults

December 31, 2014     
"A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. **The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war**, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control."

The expectation is set within a population that war, hate, insulting are the default of humanity by Putin and Surkov. In information warfare, that society insecurity is the norm, and mistakes like climate change are just more opportunity to defeat other human populations.
