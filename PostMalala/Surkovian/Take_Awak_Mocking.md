The HyperRealtiiy is mocking itself. Donald Trump is the master of all human mocking. The most successful creator of mockery as media environments.

» All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the message. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. «

## Please stop mocking

Stop thinking Trump is { idiot, dumb, stupid, moron, lazy }. Look at the man! Beign on stage, public speaking is something probably only 20% of people can do without being exhausted. Study musicians and YouTube content cretors who do edited / scripted nonfiction work. Comedians and famous people. TRUMP thrives! He isnn't lazy!

Trump is not a leader of goodness. Trump leads people into badness itself. Trump is a month to the flame that leads others into the flame. 

### Trump is a leader

Please stop the mocking. Look at how all media systems acrosss the world cover him. "Antics Politics", "Punk Politics", "What the fuck! Politics", Surkovian Politcs 2.0, Super Surkovian Politics.

Donald Trump has a natural gift of spotting what gets under the skin of people. He has a perpherial vision, like eyes in the back of his head, of how any person around him reacts to fashion / 

He does not do it for respect. Trump does not play a casino to earn money. Sting's Shape of my hert song lyrics.
