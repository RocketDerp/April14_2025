# Post Postman / Post Surkov

Which came first, the Moscow chicken or the Manhattan egghead?

Neil Postman, Huxly, Brave New World    
Vlad Surkov, Zero Point Energy    
Rich Roderick, half way to Surkov in 1993.   

1986 summer, in the realm of Postman: 

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Well, yes. There would be no hero deed unless there were an achievement. We can have the hero who fails, but he’s usually represented as a kind of clown, someone pretending to more than he can achieve.

BILL MOYERS: How is a hero different from a leader?

CAMPBELL: That is a problem Tolstoy dealt with in War and Peace. Here you have Napoleon ravaging Europe and now about to invade Russia, and Tolstoy raises this question: Is the leader really a leader, or is he **simply the one out in front on a wave**? In psychological terms, the leader might be **analyzed as the one who perceived what could be achieved and did it**.

MOYERS: It has been said that a leader is someone who discerned the inevitable and got in front of it. Napoleon was a leader, but he wasn’t a hero in the sense that what he accomplished was grand for humanity’s sake. It was for France, the glory of France.

CAMPBELL: Then he is a French hero, is he not? This is the problem for today. Is the hero of a given state or people what we need today, when the whole planet should be our field of concern? Napoleon is the nineteenth-century counterpart of Hitler in the twentieth. Napoleon’s ravaging of Europe was horrific.

Was Surkov simply the one in year 2011 out in front of the Before Hollywood Caves of Altamira mythology waves? The water wakes of Finnegans Wakes?
