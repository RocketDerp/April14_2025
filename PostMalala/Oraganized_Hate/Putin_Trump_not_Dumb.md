Putin is not dumb.     
Hitler was not dumb.     
Trump is not dumb.     

HASHTAGS: All three, Putin / Trump / Hitler, knew the Torah + Bible were #ScienceFiction and how audiences worship bow to #Fiction Storytellers. Rupert Murdoch knows too. Not stupid people.

HASHTAGS: George Lucas #PowerOfMyth 1988 book. #GeorgeLucas educated.

# Power of Myth: Putin & Trump

Putin and Trump are mythmakers. The 1988 book that George Lucas wanted science fiction audiences to know, "Power of Myth".

The word "Myth" is right in there, as is the 1980's. On the Christmas Day Reddit front page. Christmas is a myth! Jesus is not born on Christmas, there is no evidence of December 25 birthday of Jesus. It is mythology. And so is Donald Trump's life.  But do not discount myth making. Business shut down on December 25. Trump knows how to make science fiction storytelling serve Putin - by wrecking the USA. But people abandon Carl Sagan authentic science learning in favor of fiction stories from Trump / Putin / Murdoch. It isn't dumb if it works. They have outsmarted every person who can't find "Power of Myth" book from 1988. Nobody heard of George Lucas?

# Christmas Today 

Donald Trump isn't *dumb*. Trump understands that magical **Christmas "baby-daddy" stories** of outer-space alien pregnancy outsell science and nonfiction. Donald Trump isn't stupid, he knows that fiction is way more popular to his fandoms. Merry Christmas, who is the Baby-Daddy of Jesus? Trump understand people want Truth Social to be fiction wild sex stories. Putin understands, Murdoch understands, Musk understands. They are not dumb about fiction vs. nonfiction when it comes to audience popularity.

# The Day After

The Day After Christmas     
Morning USA Friday December 26, 2025

Google Search shows the Reddit posting. And look at the next result, nonsense about how other art work supports anti-goodness messages. Romans 11:32 Bible verse, Jesus is the very source of sinners, the father fro outer-space who magically got Mary pregnant with the baby Jesus. Hollywood isn't allowed to make science fiction stories like Star Wars according to this Facebook preacher who got into Google Search results! Apparently, only ONE science fiction book is perfect, the Levant Bible from 2,000 years ago and James Joyce's Finnegans Wake science fiction story from year 1923 / 1924 onward isn't able to outdo the Bible after 1,900 years. A Christian Preacher that says ONLY the story of Christ is the true science fiction storytelling.

Anyway... layered enough redundancy on this Christmas Day message about { Putin, Trump, Murdoch, Musk } and their science fiction Twitter and Truth Social venues. Reddit and Facebook need to be woke to science fiction fandom behaviors on Christmas Day and Trump $59.99 Bible imported from the Middle East. Thomas Jefferson year 1820 Bible edits from 200 years ago aren't even known to Americans who wave the flag! Anyway... enough layered redundancy on this Christmas garlic / onion?

"The Department of Homeland Security’s tasteless holiday shitposting may have just violated the United States Constitution. The federal agency’s official X account published multiple posts Thursday that appeared to violate the Establishment Clause, which prohibits government actions that favor one religion over another."

&nbsp;

Putin is not stupid dumb, Trump is not stupid dumb / Twitter owner Elon Musk where this was posted is not stupid dumb. We The People are not Woke to media ecology that Jesus science fiction and Santa Claus science fiction outsell nonfiction sincere leadership. Donald Trump governs by fiction storytelling. He can say anything and do anything he wishes, because in fiction anything goes. It isn't dumb, it's what Putin mastered and how Putin leads the nation. Audiences, We The People, flock to shitpostings and fictions.
