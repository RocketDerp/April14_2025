Sarah Lawrence College for women professor and former White House communications employee of USA government. Age 81 / age 82 / age 83 interviews conducted in the final three years of life.

BILL MOYERS: That’s where the paternalistic idea grew.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Women are booty, they are goods. With the fall of a city, every woman in the city would be raped.

MOYERS: There’s this ethical contradiction mentioned in your book, quoting **Exodus**: “Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife — except abroad. Then you should put all males to the sword, and the women you shall take as booty to yourself.” That’s right out of the Old Testament.

CAMPBELL: **Deuteronomy**. Those are fierce passages.

MOYERS: And what do they say to you about **women**?

CAMPBELL: They say **more about Deuteronomy than about women**. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.

Now, **today (year 1987) there is no out-group anymore on the planet**. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face — because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the **Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.”** Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were **symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew**, which **you do not find in the Indo-European** mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female** is a function of biblical thinking.

MOYERS: Because when you substitute the male for the female, you get a different psychology, a different cultural bias. And it’s permissible in your culture to do what your gods do, so you just —

CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it. I would see three situations here. First, the early one of the Goddess, when the male is hardly a significant divinity. Then the reverse, when the male takes over her role. And finally, then, the classical stage, where the two are in interaction — as they are also, for example, in **India**.

MOYERS: Where does that arise?

CAMPBELL: It comes from the **attitude of the Indo-Europeans**, who **did not completely devaluate the female** principle.

MOYERS: What about the virgin birth? Suddenly, the Goddess reappears in the form of the chaste and pure vessel chosen for God’s action.

CAMPBELL: In the history of Western religions, this is an extremely interesting development. In the Old Testament, you have a God who creates a world without a goddess. Then when you come to Proverbs, there she is, Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom, who says, “When He created the world, I was there, and I was His greatest joy.” But in the Hebrew tradition the idea of a son of God is repulsive, it is not considered at all. The Messiah as the son of God is not actually God’s son. He is one who in his character and dignity is worthy to be likened to the son of God. I’m sure there’s no idea of a virgin birth in that tradition. The virgin birth comes into Christianity by way of the Greek tradition. When you read the four gospels, for example, the only one in which the virgin birth appears is the Gospel According to Luke, and Luke was a Greek.

MOYERS: And in the Greek tradition there were images, legends, myths of virgin births?

### Correcting Campbell

Rarely do I get to correct / emphasize points about Joseph Campbell's writings / interviews.

Isaiah 7:14 (authorship: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah )  mentions the virgin birth concept. Matthew 1:22-23 (authorship: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthew ) also. 

Contradicting Campbell: "the only one in which the virgin birth appears is the Gospel According to Luke, and Luke"

Year 1987 Joseph Campbell didn't have modern Google Search to easily fact-check.

Now it is possible Campbell was making a more subtle point that few under my radar / over my head. But still interesting to point out verses that mention virgin birth here. From a media ecology, redundancy of monomyth tropes / monomyth opcodes perspective. Also point out that this was at Skywalker Ranch and "Luke" was on the Skywalker mind of Campbell ;)
