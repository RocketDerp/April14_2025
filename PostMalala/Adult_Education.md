* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013.

* “How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space, 1994

### Eden a real planet?

1985 / 1986 / 1987:

BILL MOYERS: Do you think there was such a place as the Garden of Eden?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Of course not. The Garden of Eden is a metaphor for that innocence that is innocent of time, innocent of opposites, and that is the prime center out of which consciousness then becomes aware of the changes.

&nbsp; 

...

BILL MOYERS: Given what you know about human beings, is it conceivable that there is a port of wisdom beyond the conflicts of truth and illusion by which our lives can be put back together again? Can we develop new models?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They’re already here, in the religions. All religions have been true for their time. If you can recognize the enduring aspect of their truth and separate it from the temporal applications, you’ve got it.

We’ve spoken about it right here: the sacrifice of the physical desires and fears of the body to that which spiritually supports the body; is the body **learning to know and express** its own deepest life in the field of time? One way or another, we all have to find what best fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life, and dedicate ourselves to that.

&nbsp;

In other words, innocent of the Taliban terrorism in January 2009, Malala.

TikTok / Redit / TV star / The Media

The Entertainment Media / The Amusement TikTok media   

The Reality TV Media, THE MEDIA. Neil Postamn's "The Medium" focus.

Reddit will LOL wash tis problem, amusement-wash on the Reddit meme mill. As egoism to LOL at "dumb women" and not face up that Russia is waging a war against reality itself, a war against the facts of the USA nation (not Russia) landing on the moon in year 1969. People on Reddit community (The Media of Reddit) are not calling to Rescue Kim, it is instead an entertainment to mock and insult Kim and insult TikTok while Reddit is infiltrated by the IRA since year 2013. Surkov won and Reddit end-users can't name Surkov or IRA. The point Reddit can not face: Adults get their educate from Reddit and Tik Tok. Kim just had a birthday: age 45 years. October 21, 1980. She doesn't have dementia like age 79 Trump, she isn't a diaper wearing old man - she is age 45. And Reddit community will not face up that AGE FOURTY-FIVE ADULT is learning not from retangle clasrooms and "fund education", but from Tik Tok. Fox News, Reddit. That is where ADULTS LEARN. Radio Mullah F.M. https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/Malala%2038-65.pdf - the FICTION Entertainment Media, Tik Tok and Reddit.

This is where adults learn. Kim, celebety. Entertainers. Amusers. “Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. 1985
