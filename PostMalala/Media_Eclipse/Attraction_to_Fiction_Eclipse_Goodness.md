# Attraction To Fiction: Eclipse Goodness

This is probably one of the most difficult messages I have ever created.

Since I predicted the Arab Spring on December 16, 2009 - and traveled to Algeria at the start of December 2010 - I have been focused on media ecology.

But am facing repeat experience with:

1. Enshitification https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification

2. Filter Bibble https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble

3. Eternal September lock-in, conditioned state

And these are personalized filter bubble. We have reached a point since around year 2011 or 2012 where almost eveyrone available on the Internet (all across the world) has access to entertainment content like I had in 1997 in Bellevue Washington (paid for by my employer, sports team owner / film invester / rock music museum / software empire / any book I desired)

I don't want it. I traveled, I lived in Africa, I lived in the Middle East, I lived in the EU. I RV traveled all over the USA since November 1999.

Focusing on the Levant religions and Dr. Martin Luther King's year 1954 learning (his education perspective of Christian killing Jewish in World War Two, and war between Christians such as Germans killing French Christians / London Christians)....

I mean: The GOOD NEWS is that religion does teach "Love one Another". But I can't find anyone who asserts the connection to MLK Jr on the world stage high enough... other than Bernie Sandards and Malala from Pakistan. And Malala seems to want to be a mother and not continue her year 2011 ideals - and frankly, society is so toxic that gun worship played a part in why she even was listened to in the first palce. But her language is articulate and descriptive enough that I can see where she is coming from. Bernie Sanders, he almost made President and wanted to really reform the Middle East attitudes on violence and often cites MLK Jr.

But people wont' rally around Bernie Sanders for MLK Jr and his promotion of the Second Bill of Rights January 1944 as a *learning lesson* at the very least (What Second Bill of Rights predicted in direct langauge). but people want to focus this past 12 months on Lugii - not Bernie promtoing MLK Jr. and health care via Second Bill of Rights.

Discourse has become enshitifed. In all the ways Neil Postman described enshitifation of dialog and debate. Bernie on Second Bill and NOT cheering Luigi is abandoned in favor of shit gun worship action seeking role mdoels (Walter White bad guys admiration like Vince Gillian described in early 2025 to WGA)

God is this painful to write. I'm not talking the composion of english, the depth of the species we have become with the anti-Malala and anti-MLK Jr.

I have never enjoyed hate or revenge for one single minute. It is not enjoyable to me. Other seem to be outright attracted to Putin / Trump as a kind of TV screen game / video screen game. Like Luigi cheering for more hate against leaders. 

I want us to define, cultivate and cheer on GOOD leaders. Not bully and murder bad leaders.

I know I am not the only one inpsired by Malala since January 2009 blogging started in Swat Valley Pakistan. And i'm at a crossroads of abandoing social media asserting / standing up for good. Because "good" to people is hate, and they interpret you are seeking hate.

I do not want to run away from the problem or cheer on MAGA and Trump. Calling Trump dementia and dumb is cheering him on and I've known that all along. Power from We The People goes up to Putin and Trump with hate.

But the ENTERTAINMENT addiction problems we have. People in the Middle East willing to die for { Quran, Torah, Bible } science fiction storytelling entertainment and hate - I do not enjoy this and never have! Other seem to enjoy it, including my living in Africa and Jordan during Arab Spring.

The hope was for hate of the targeted people. The hope during the Arab Spring was not world peace. Malala came from January 2009 to World Peace, but the Arab Spring actually lead to Russian desires in 2012 for World War.

God I find it so difficult in writing this message
