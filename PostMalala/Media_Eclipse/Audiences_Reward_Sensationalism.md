# Audiences Reward Sensationalism

Post Malala : Media Ecology

"The Horrifying Truth We Missed in Nightcrawler"   

Malala as a *social movement* was a product of sensationalism. But she had an innocence of the Internet that the Arab Spring university women sort of had in 2009 build-up.

1. Books were safe from across the world. Forbidden, banned, burned by the Taliban, but READING alone is safe.
2. Creating, writing, posting, blogging. January 3, 2009
3. Children have routines, killing Malala on a school bus was symbolic of a system. Like a shooting. A school bus shooting.
4. Fame that game with her gender, age, location of the political assassination
5. unfinished, needs rewritten, napkin drawing. Artist crumpling up opening page from typewriter over and over scene.

Sensational news. Sensory sensations.  

ToDo: I'm exhausted as I write this, even for me. Trumpism MAGA USA values and the lack of REDDIT_BLACKOUT is really really grinding on me. People are so thrilled to have scoop / tea on Epstein and not wanting teach and educate morality. The Rick Roderick 1993 duke students desires https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-wdnST5vFx0TcbgtDtCk0ew0XFXgBSdT clip rung loud in my ears.

blah blah blah, exhausted

Novelty. Sensationalism. Exotic. Unusual. Sound-track to video.

People really are engaged about how much they hate the voice-over, how much they hate the music that is on a video clip.

People USED TO complain about the video capture. But people now record phone screens, tiny box within box within box of photocopied video recordings. Some of this is to bypass copyright rights management systems?

Old White Man finds Computers acting / actor. Novelty attraction. Freak show of a White Male Executive not having his secretary or a director re-shoot the scenes. Clifton performance art.
