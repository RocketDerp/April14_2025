# Dementia-Washing all of MAGA

Elon Musk is not age 79 with dementia. Yet he has chainsaws on stage and made wild claims about D.O.G.E. and was in the White House for months in year 2025.

MAGA audience of Fox News HDTV doesn't all have dementia.

The dementia-washing of hundreds of millions of people who trust one man, Donald Trump, is avoiding a lot of other issues.

All the "dementia" talk around Elon Musk, White House - ignores the elephant in the room. People not questioning if artificial intelligence explains the unusual behaviors of the White House choices. Trusting AI advice. #TheELIZAeffect

Donald Trump is WELL KNOWN for trusting Fox News Television screens and Trump Trusting what he reads on Twitter screens.  

Trump is WELL KNOWN for trusting bullshit. What if the entire White House / MAGA is trusting A. I. bullshit? Crazy AI shit.
