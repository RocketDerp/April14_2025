# Dementia-Washing all of MAGA

Elon Musk is not age 79 with dementia. Yet he has chainsaws on stage and made wild claims about D.O.G.E. and was in the White House for months in year 2025.

MAGA audience of Fox News HDTV doesn't all have dementia.

The dementia-washing of hundreds of millions of people who trust one man, Donald Trump, is avoiding a lot of other issues.

All the "dementia" talk around Elon Musk, White House - ignores the elephant in the room. People not questioning if artificial intelligence explains the unusual behaviors of the White House choices. Trusting AI advice. #TheELIZAeffect

Donald Trump is WELL KNOWN for trusting Fox News Television screens and Trump Trusting what he reads on Twitter screens.  

Trump is WELL KNOWN for trusting bullshit. What if the entire White House / MAGA is trusting A. I. bullshit? Crazy AI shit.

Bluesky + Reddit are FULL of message after message about **Dementia** leaders every single hour of every day in year 2025 USA. But only 3,000 followers on Bluesky for the far more serious topic of **MAGA** mind-sets / mob mentality.

&nbsp;

"Bandy X. Lee first publicly challenged Donald Trump in May 2017, after hosting a conference on the ethics of speaking about his mental state in April 2017. In an interview following the conference, she stated he had mental impairments and that his presidency posed a "state of emergency". This was followed by her work as the editor of the book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, published in the fall of 2017."

Social media users of Reddit and Bluesky repeat and repeat comment after comment every minute about "dementia" of one single person. The fixation on age 79 Donald J. Trump (fixatinn / attraction to status symbol / icon, mannerisms and unique style of Trump). Again and again the word "dementia" repeated. but the same people will not do any search engine (Google, etc) and be serious on the topic. Recency bias abounds, low effort one-word "dementia" abounds. There is an ABSENCE OF: asserting the conference in April 2017 that Dr. Brandy X. Lee held and SUSTAIN FOCUS of REPEATING her name. A woman who stands up to Trump is ignored. Just like Malala is ignored by Bluesky and Reddit social media repeating and assertion regarding young girls being abused by powerful elders like Epsiten and Taliban. A woman who stands up to Right Wing media (Jen Senko) is ignored on Bluesky and Reddit in repeat assertions.

Only 1,200 followers on Bluesky. Despite the constant message assertion of "dementia" and "Fox News" problems... people using social media avoid: seeking out women who stand up to Trump, women who stand up to MAGA, women who stand up to Murdoch, women who stand up to Musk.  Social media society is not assert them as seriously on Bluesky and Reddit. Even famous women like AOC and Hillary Clinton are not asserting these serious **deeper, non-shallow, non-superficial** topics of Jen Senko media ecology, Dr. Bandy X Lee mob mentality psycology. 

Social media society, Bluesky and Reddit year 2025, keeps chanting "dementia" but will not site wourld-famous "Scientific American" about MAGA and Trump mental disorders. Dr. Bandy X Lee gets ignored, and when women stick their neck out against men like Epsiten and Trump and Putin - social media society does not repeat assert the women's names and women's writings! https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/  Instead, people assert and repeat male Trump-speak every hour of every day on Bluesky and Reddit. What is absent: SERIOUS assertion of Jen senko, Malala, Dr. Bandy X Lee!

* Google search A.I.: "The most popular phrases used to mock Donald Trump's distinctive style of speaking (often referred to as "Trump-speak") include the unintentional neologism "covfefe", the boastful phrase "a very stable genius", and the exaggerated claim of constant "winning"."

Parroting the male leader keywords: "epstein" "dementia" (Trump) is thought-terminating behaivor of Bluesky audiences / touch device consumers / Reddit audiences. That is the media ecology behavior of civic duty social media usage being called out!
