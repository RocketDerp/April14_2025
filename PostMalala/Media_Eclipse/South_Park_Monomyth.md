There are aliens in South Park.   
Peopole will not take serious that Torah / Quran / Bible triology is based on outer-space aliens "angels" and an outer-space planet "Eden" and outer-space "Heaven".

It is the bamboozle of clergy that needs to be addressed. People who will not translate dreams and visions of South Park TV show to Quran show. Star Wars year 1977 to Quran year 635. This ability to translate monomyth to monomyth, metaphor to metaphor level translation.
