# Innovations in Killing

I have seen so many creative electronics and technology people my life growing up in the privileged of being welcomed in the 1982 and on technology field.

Japan and USA had a real technological hardware and software period from 1982 to 1999. Of course, Taiwan and other places.

Now China has a ton of manufacturing and creative solutions experience in year 2025. Korea, etc.

If those talented and creative men turn to making new cheap weapon systems... humanity may see change like we have never seen.

If killing devices become distant, or without origin (shot or launch location) noise, or without metal that metal detectors rely on, or more remote-control 

# Blah, I'm too tired to write.

But I think people assume guns as we know them are what we have to deal with. I suspect big leaps into new killing devices and methods could come out of hate motivations we keep breeding with egomania leaders.
