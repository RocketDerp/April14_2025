# Entertaiment Progress

Entertainment keeps progressing. Even Malala's film producer, books, clothes.

What is not progressing is love, compassion, forgiveness, parenting, education, understanding.

Snark, insults, memes, sports games, hotels for wealthy, airports for wealthy, keep advancing. Nature, peace, respect.

People do not prize learning from mistakes, progress of people turning away from hate / violence / terrorism.
