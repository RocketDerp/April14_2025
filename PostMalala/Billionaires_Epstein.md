# Billionaires Epstein

Poor people and young girls who need education aren't in "The Epstein Files".

Billionaires, sex life of the rich and famous.

Sunday October 26, 2025 called it out on Reddit society:     
https://old.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1ogkf76/billionaires_versus_workers/

People want "files", they don't want girls to be given a voice, they repeat and repeat on social media in year 2025 that they want "Q Drops", QAnon Drops, PizzaGate "Files" of information.

Malala wants to end all hate, end all segregation based on gender and education.

When will we call out the clergy, the USA church clergy, for not making Bible verse "1 John 3:17" about wealth a topic every person knows. What good is that science fiction story of space alien angels and outer-space God if we can't even find a good page, "1 John 3:17" and apply it to workers / those in need of housing / food? Why can't the clergy see the "1 John 3:17" problem of billionaires like Elon Musk and DOGE in the White House?

**Sex Sorting Business**

The USA population is unable to face that the culture itself, Hollywood films & music industry, is a sex sorting business. Sexy voices of singers, sexually alluring lyrics, sexy actors, sexy clothing, sexy posing, sexy staging, sexy scenes. #MeToo #PostParadoxOpera 

It is a paradox that the freedom to abuse others is a freedom you don't exercise.

Music industry has been exploiting sexy talented people for power and wealth since the 1950's. Rock musicians often exploit their own fandoms. 

Trump is #Celebrity - social power over superficial and shallow mindsets

"In any case, ah, if **Baudrillard** is even onto something, what the postmodern trajectory means is that the self is not under siege, it’s lost. It’s just lost. And if that’s true then all of the strategies by which **ordinary people try to live decent good lives are lost** along with it." - year 1993 https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

# Abuse as attraction

#PostMarriage #PostFamily #AntiImmigrant

Part of what has happened you can study by the family of Donald Trump. In marriages and intimate relationships, people constantly watch for "red flags" and abandon relationships. In the #MAGA values society, people disown family members who join #FoxNews cult. Nobody is learning from mistakes.

The anti-Immigrant MAGA movement is a machine-blocking idea. People are more thrilled to declare hate than compassion. People join hate fandoms, mocking fandoms, of people or music bands or hate-watching TV shows. People enjoy hating their ex-lovers more than any authentic joy of parenting and family. Does Donald Trump and Elon Musk entertain their children with consumer goods and purchases. Trump and Musk children are raised to be consumers. Conspicuous consumption.

Love and compassion have been abandoned in favor of hate-watching and anti-immigration blocking of poor people. Rich people are taunting poor people as entertainment. Marriage and parenting rich people consider tedious and not enjoyable. Epstein provided the exciting lifestyle the rich people wanted, freedom to abuse captive children for pleasure. Abuse is the core of the entire MAGA movement, hate of poor people, abuse of poor people.

Leo Buscaglia who died in year 1998 at the age of 74... was the kind of leader pointing out the abandonment of love and compassion. Instead of learning love in our intimate relationships, people now in year 2026 block / disown / move to another city / let the courts fight child custody battles. People have a dream when they start a romance or marriage, but they do not build dreams, they quit and move on like it is a job change. There is no growth, there is consumerism. And hating up on poor people or untalented people is what rich people do. Hate upon the failures is what billionaires have programmed into society. Give up on love, give up on compassion, give up on empathy - Epstein provided all that lifestyle.

Epstein provided the freedom to abuse the poor and weak. The freedom to abuse and freedom to use. The billionaire's programming. I worked for a bachelor billionaire. 3rd richest man in the world, who worked with the 1st richest man in the world. I was their private staff servant in year 1997 when the money doubled in a single year 1998. Single, unmarried, bachelor billionaire that was a master of controlling.

Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein were about formalizing and organizing that desire to abuse the poor. to hate upon your ex-lover and dispose of inward compassion-learning journey of marriage in favor of private first-class jet and private first-class island. Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein were consumerist commodity brokers for billionaire anti-marriage. Poor people are the source of wealth and power, abuse the fuck out of them. That was my work experience of Paul Allen and Jody Allen in 1997, 1998, 1999 the hayday payday wealth-doubling pre-Y2K years. Exploit and abuse the poor people. Jody Allen got divorced... Paul Allen never got married. You don't grow the human compassion for all the world, you develop the hate of poor people. And Fox News HDTV has made that popular even for poor people to hate poor people. Anti-immigrants, anti-compassion, anti "liberals" who might go to university and re-discover Leo Buscaglia who died in year 1998 at the age of 74...

“America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.

Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five
