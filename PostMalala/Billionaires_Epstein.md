# Billionares Epstein

Poor people and young girls who need education aren't in "The Epstein Files".

Billionares, sex life of the rich and famous.

Sunday October 26, 2025 called it out on Reddit society:

People want "files", they don't want girls to be given a voice, they repeat and repeat on social media in year 2025 that they want "Q Drops", QAnon Drops, PizzaGate "Files" of information.

Malala wants to end all hate, end all segregation based on genderr and education.

When will we call out the clergy, the USA church clergy, for not making Bible vese "1 John 3:17" about wealth a topic every person knows. What good is that science fiction story of space alien angels and outer-space God if we can't even find a good page, "1 John 3:17" and apply it to workers / those in need of houseing / food? Why can't the clergy see the "1 John 3:17" problem of billionaires like Elon Musk and DOGE in the White House?
