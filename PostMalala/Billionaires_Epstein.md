# Billionaires Epstein

Poor people and young girls who need education aren't in "The Epstein Files".

Billionaires, sex life of the rich and famous.

Sunday October 26, 2025 called it out on Reddit society:

People want "files", they don't want girls to be given a voice, they repeat and repeat on social media in year 2025 that they want "Q Drops", QAnon Drops, PizzaGate "Files" of information.

Malala wants to end all hate, end all segregation based on gender and education.

When will we call out the clergy, the USA church clergy, for not making Bible verse "1 John 3:17" about wealth a topic every person knows. What good is that science fiction story of space alien angels and outer-space God if we can't even find a good page, "1 John 3:17" and apply it to workers / those in need of housing / food? Why can't the clergy see the "1 John 3:17" problem of billionaires like Elon Musk and DOGE in the White House?

**Sex Sorting Business**

The USA population is unable to face that the culture itself, Hollywood films & music industry, is a sex sorting business. Sexy voices of singers, sexually alluring lyrics, sexy actors, sexy clothing, sexy posing, sexy staging, sexy scenes. #MeToo #PostParadoxOpera 

It is a paradox that the freedom to abuse others is a freedom you don't exercise.

Music industry has been exploiting sexy talented people for power and wealth since the 1950's. Rock musicians often exploit their own fandoms.

"In any case, ah, if **Baudrillard** is even onto something, what the postmodern trajectory means is that the self is not under siege, it’s lost. It’s just lost. And if that’s true then all of the strategies by which **ordinary people try to live decent good lives are lost** along with it." - year 1993 https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/
