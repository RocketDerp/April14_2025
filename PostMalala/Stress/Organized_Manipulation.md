# Organized Manipulation

Organized crime of deliberate tragedy of the commons.   
Information carrels i worked for in Bellevue, Washington 1996 to Y2K.    
(And contracted before 1996 through third-party corporations)    
The abandonment of IBM as leader in information systems around 1993.   
Eternal September exploitation

***Organized*** *Manipulation*  
Richest people in the world are organized in manipulating everyday people with shallow, superficial information.

# Constant Stress

I found professional educators at Duke University describing the experience in year 1995 onward that I witnessed in Bellevue Washington year 1996 onward as an insider. An east-coast professor describing my west coast job in year 1996 and professional experiences / my own observations:

* **year 1993**: "The postmodern trajectory leaves us in a situation where drawing the line between the real and the unreal is no longer merely philosophical but a practical day-to-day issue. See, this is what I want to drive home. We are not off in some fairy land, this is a practical day-to-day issue of figuring out what’s a simulation and what’s not. Is this guy really an insurance salesman or is he here to rob me? You know, I mean… this is no longer Cartesian doubt that one has to conjure up in a meditation. **This is a wide radical doubt about the very ground beneath our feet** and the nature of whether it’s real or not." - Duke University. https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

These words articulate exactly the sickening feeling. The most powerful systems devised by humanity are manipulating people. The stress is enormous! So much fiction is in conflict with nonfiction reality.

# Abusers Abound  

UNDERSTANDING_TRUMPISM    
systems of abuse abound.  
Silence, Don't Talk About It, Denial Abounds.   
Avoidance, Secrecy, Inward kept from public eye   
The Abuse you get for speaking up in public is WORSE than the abuse inside private affairs.   
People are more scared of being humiliated in public than being abused in private spaces.  
People are more scared of being called "crazy" in public than solving the abuse in private.

* "Centuries of husbandry, decades of diligent culling, the work of numerous hearts and hands, have gone into the hackling, sorting, and spinning of this tightly twisted yarn. Furthermore, we have not even to risk the adventure alone; for the heroes of all time have gone before us; the labyrinth is thoroughly known; we have only to follow the thread of the hero-path. **And where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a god**; where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves; where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence; and where we had **thought to be alone**, we shall be with all the world." - Year 1949.
