# Constant Stress

I found professional educators at Duke University describing the experience in year 1993 that I witnessed in Bellevue Washington. An east-coast professor describing my west coast job and professional observations:

* year 1993: "The postmodern trajectory leaves us in a situation where drawing the line between the real and the unreal is no longer merely philosophical but a practical day-to-day issue. See, this is what I want to drive home. We are not off in some fairy land, this is a practical day-to-day issue of figuring out what’s a simulation and what’s not. Is this guy really an insurance salesman or is he here to rob me? You know, I mean… this is no longer Cartesian doubt that one has to conjure up in a meditation. This is a wide radical doubt about the very ground beneath our feet and the nature of whether it’s real or not." - Duke University. https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

The most powerful systems devised by humanity are manipulating people. The stress is enormous! So much fiction is in conflict with nonfiction reality.
