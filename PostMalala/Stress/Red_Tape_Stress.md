Red tape and stress and chambers of discomfrt to discourage people from using a limited and expensive resource: medical knowledge and "seek out a doctor, don't research and learn on your own self" pro-ignorance values. Stress used as a way to gate-keep and keep-out sick and injured people with systems of domination, stressing, red tape, paperwork, barriers of protoocl and jargon langauge to assert against those who need this rare and kept-scarce knowledge and "ONLY ask professionals" anti-open secrative ("keep your human body weakness and diseases secret from people" attitudes encouraged / legal laws of secrecy, hiding humanity and humanism and reality itself).

The one thing all lfe on earth shares is diseases / death / illness / injury. But people are educated, programmed in their mind, conditioned, and stressed by paperwork / red-tape / dehumanizing gate-keeping to not seek help and keep secret that we all need each other and medical help. To use red-tape and secrecy of inromation so that only some clergy is allowed inforamtion and hide and red-tape wrap-up in red tape people to the point that stress itself kills billions. As people don't want to share goodness, they want to dominate and red-tape information and knowledge. The Eve Tree of Knowledge mtaphors of life are lost on people who prize competittion of how grat they ar at finding services, past all the red-tape barrier and the poor and needy in the world. The pride people have of their overcoming cancer with thier red-tape corporation talents and dehumanizing paperwork skills. Anti-education, anti-sharing, proud the climbed the highest and rare mountain of gate-keeping secretive society of "keep out" sterile medical cultures - gate-keeped into sterility by businessmen and leaders who prize medical tratment as polticial and lording power with red-tape over unimportant and troubled peeoople seeking help. Paperwork, reception, tape and beuarocracy lording stress over humanity.

(Same goes for the society-wide attitude, especially in USA, of pepole never declaring: I wish all medical knoweldge and teaching was on a Wikipedia / Wiki system to share ith the whole world and save lives. - Especially during Christmas season when I create this comment and the posting. People do not declare goodness desires of having free knowledge of the human body organized by mankind / humanity. Despite all of us having a body and sickness in common. And the COVID-2019 / 2020 pandemic was an airport to airport gloal event, and people still don't act like we are all networked with diseases and common mutliple-languages Wikipedia needs.)
