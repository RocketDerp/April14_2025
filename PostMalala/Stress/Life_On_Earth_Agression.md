"So, he is a male 2yo ginger cat. **He was attacked 6 months back by a stray** male and since then he gets mental whenever he spots the stray and has already attacked us few times (my mom, dad and brother) even though he lives with us. Today, i took him for a walk and they stray coincidentally spotted him and tried to make his attempt but i was quick enough to lift my cat and run, but while doing so, my cat got mental and started biting the shit out of my arm. I had to drop him and tried to pacify him but he didn’t listen and looked like he was possessed and started chasing me to bite me."

1. Was terrorized 6 months earlier

2. Brain chemistry and behavior changed for long period of time.

This is the kind of long-term pandemic trauma, Fox News audience, Islamic terrorism clergy / expeiences - people can't seem to discuss other than in flippiant dismissive trivialiing ways.

WHY people over-eat, alocohol, drug use, the underlying mind changes
