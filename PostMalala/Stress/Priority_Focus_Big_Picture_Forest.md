# Priority Focus: { Big Picture, Forest }

Forest for the trees   
Hyper focus is good if you focus on essential and important global topics   
Short attention span, unable to focus, is billionaire media targeting    
Bombardment from billionaires of cloud TCP/IP computing upon minds    


* "::: It allows us, for one thing, to engage in a bit of what I consider… if you wanted to sum up the wisdom of the east, you know, Oriental wisdom in just one sentence, it might be something like “Don’t sweat the small stuff”. I mean, there was a real well known Buddhist who told me “I can sum up the dao and the gita; all of that for you quickly… It’s this: Don’t sweat the small stuff. You westerners, you spend all your time sweating the small stuff…” :::" - https://rickroderick.org/302-heidegger-and-the-rejection-of-humanism-1993/

Westerners

1. Islam: Prayer time exactly correct with moon. Small stuff.
2. Islam: Dressing of women to cover gender. Small stuff / shallowness.
3. Westerners: movie-rental late fees. Small stuff, punishing shallowness.
4. Westerners: People who work independent at office, home-worker candidates, and schedule.
5. Westerners: conformity to fashion, style, cosmetics, beauty surgery.
6. Westerners: the decoration and syntax of language over meaning. meme decoration prized over understanding / depth.

Why did I just make that list?

* "Of course this would have nothing to do with banalisation. Well, of course it would. But anything that is a threat to the system can be banalised. I’ll give you two examples in the sphere of politics. The way they turned Jesse Jackson from a serious social actor, into sort of a banal caricature of himself in the media. They have banalised a real threat to the system, which was the Rainbow Coalition. A real threat – populist threat to the system – banalised into a joke." https://rickroderick.org/304-marcuse-and-one-dimensional-man-1993/
