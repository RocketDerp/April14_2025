“If we could learn to look instead of gawking,   
We'd see the horror in the heart of farce,    
If only we could act instead of talking,    
We wouldn't always end up on our arse.   
This was the thing that nearly had us mastered;    
Don't yet rejoice in his defeat, you men!    
Although the world stood up and stopped the bastard,   
The bitch that bore him is in heat again.”   
― Bertolt Brecht, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui     
year 1941
