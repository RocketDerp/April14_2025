# World Malala Timeline Year 2012

Wednesday, December 17, 2025 morning USA

1. "A lot of men seem genuinely confused about why dating feels harder for them, while loudly aligning with politics that undermine women’s rights and autonomy." - December 17, 2025

2. "a reflection of values and empathy. When someone supports movements that trivialize women’s safety or agency, it’s not surprising that women lose interest. That isn’t intolerance. It’s discernment." - December 17, 2025

&nbsp;

# Timeline Perspective

1. 2009 January - Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan starts blogging about women's issues. Access to computers / Internet was letting Muslim / Islamic women speak out / blogging. https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19899540 **"I am afraid - 3 January 2009"**

2. 2010 (2009) Arab Spring heating up ([Jasmine revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/Jasmine-Revolution)) driven by **sustained culture of** college educated women in Tunisia / Algeria being free from arranged marriage and educated for first time. First generation learned adult women with access to personal computers in privacy of their home in year 2010 to join Facebook / Twitter and read other languages and educated women watch YouTube outside their home city. **"A Quiet Revolution in Algeria: Gains by Women" The New York Times** Africa - May 26, 2007 — "A quiet revolution is under way: women are emerging as an economic and political force unheard of in the rest of the Arab world." **May 26, 2007** https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html I know it ties back to 2007 and Internet home computers with women allowed to access anything or talk to anyone, because I married one of those college educated free-thinking women over Facebook - after dating a prior one  in Tunisia. It was a hot summer end, Ramadan 2010. And I relocated to Algeria at the start of December 2010. All the Islamic adult women I was meeting on Facebook were age 23 to 32, college educated, intelligent, read and wrote English - from December 16, 2009 (when I noticed it was trending as I was returning to Marshall McLuhan / Neil Postman / Joseph Campbell / Bill Moyers media studies) when I lived in Austin, Texas.

3. 2011 Arab Spring becomes violent in Egypt, Syria (I moved over to Amman Jordan to live to study Syira war outbreak / media ecology of Levant in March 2011)

4. morning of October 9, 2012, 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban

5. January 3, 2013, Malala Yousafzai was discharged from the hospital

6. October 8, 2013 Malala's book published. “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

9. November 8, 2013. Donald Trump establishes his public concerns. Moscow Russia arrival in private jet. Sex show of girls / women - leading women for entertainment and stimulation of audiences. Old white men will use young girls and women to engage media audiences, consumers of HDTV and Internet media. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe_2013 Sex Show of women by dirty old white men values society, MAGA USA society, United States of America and Moscow Russia Putin joined. Friday, October 8, 2013 private jet arrival. https://qz.com/920189/donald-trump-just-claimed-he-hasnt-called-russia-in-10-years-thats-not-what-hes-said-before
   


Let's go over that again from the top

1. 2009 January 3 - Malala on World Wide Web media blogging about { Women, Girls, Systemic Abuse by Taliban men }

2. 2012 October 9 - 15 year old Malala bullet in head on school bus with friends (also shot)

3. 2013 January 3 - Malala discharged from hospital

4. 2013 October 8 - Malala book published

5. 2013 November 8 - Donald Trump in Moscow Russia to { parade women, dominate women, show women for entertainment and gooning }

6. 2013 December - Moscow's Putin Kremlin announced a Conservative Takeover of the world. Published in English on December 20, 2013 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

7. 2014 February - Russia attacks with aggression, war against Ukraine

&nbsp;


Repeating again and again: Just weeks after Trump is in Moscow dominating women in November 2013 - then Putin announces that "Conservative Men" like Elon Musk / Rupert Murdoch / Donald Trump / Taliban are going to rule the world. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ - then shortly after that announcement, Putin's Russia starts raping Ukraine / attacking women and children and starting a war that never ends!

And men in the USA / MAGA prize this kind of leadership.

# Pussy Riot MAGA

This is Russian punk-rock women     
This was published BEFORE Trump won 2016 election against **woman** Hillary Clinton    
5,020,139 views October 27, 2016     
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-bKFo30o2o      

REPEATING: Produced, filmed, recorded and RELEASED October 27, 2016. Before the November 2016 election day Win of Trump!

I blame Putin for MAGA ISA. Trump isn't intelligent or understanding enough of how Surkov and Putin manipulated him in year 2013 visit to Moscow to have raging egoism of MAGA egoism. Male-dominate women egomania. I believe Trump needs to be rescued. The entire Trump family has been manipulated by { Russia, Putin, Surkov Students } since year 2012.

# USA society avoided Malala

More timelines:

Malala even came to USA    
Malala for the FIRST TIME in her life, went into a Christian Church and spoke. In the USA.    
375,759 views September 4, 2017     
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGlFU3YW_k       

And how many people repeat this as much as "Epstein List" chanting?

When a woman leads, not just Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris - people avoid the goodness leadership.

Exactly WHAT is wrong with Malala?  Instead of a pro-goodness REPEAT NAME-DROP Rally Point, not "Epstein List" chanting, - but actually giving voice to girls / women / WORLD WIDE... people flock to hate-filled Ruprt-murdoch Putin-loving Elon Musk-loving White Males.

The attraction in USA is to old white men. Look over the timelines again and again. I have been LIVING this timeline of watching everyone avoid and ignore **AUTHENTIC SINCERE EDUCATION TEACHING OF WOMEN GIRLS PROBLEMS** while Moscow Trump Putin sex exploitation of women is prized since November 8, 2013 as "leadership".

# Trump Male FIFA peace prize

This is a REAL woman with a REAL peace prize. Not ["FIFA peace prize" sports-mentality domination men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_corruption_case) garbage. "Old Boys Club" attracted to dominating women with aggression. ["Peace prize" for Trump taking away / abusing women's rights](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/27/all-the-presidents-women-review-donald-trump-sexual-predator).

**Assert Malala**    

Assert her old January 3, 2009 writing up to June 16, 2015 writing and interviews / book tours. Contrast MAGA men flocking to Malala avoidance of World Wide Web / social media society.

# Putin confirms December 2025

December 20, 2013 "Conservative International" values / Taliban values / Epstein values confirmed in late 2025.

Monday, December 22, 2025     
"Putin praises child marriages, citing Kadyrov family and North Caucasus traditions"     
https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/1ptc2mc/putin_praises_child_marriages_citing_kadyrov/       

War, murder, rape, killing, conquest, slavery, [Russian disease spreading](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192). All can be justified by "tradition".
