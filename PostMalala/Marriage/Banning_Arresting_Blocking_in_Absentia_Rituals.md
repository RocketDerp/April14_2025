"Arresting her in absentia, which is not a thing" - Pussy Riot topic / Russia / Putinism

# Government marriage "In Absentia" experience 

Marriage via proxy is a thing. I should know (first hand experience), during the Arab Spring in early December 2010 - I married my wife in north Africa in Texas, without her ever stepping food in Texas. A proxy marriage is a real thing, a proxy police arrest seems valid enough. Like burning in effigy social protest convetions, but this being a state-sponsored burning of a witch (Pussy Riot) in effigy ritual. 

In my Texas proxy marriage in early December 2010, I had to have a stand-in person physically be in the courthouse office for the wedding with the Texas marriage license noterized by a USA embassy in Africa.

* See also: how few people in the entire world, humanity, protest that government puts laws above God. That a goverment rules over who you can marry. You see this topic regarding same-sex marriages... but almost no protest against laws regulating who can be married based on religion memeberships.

# Malala, women ban

Taliban goverment bans entire gender / limits their power / wtihout them physically present. Turning the entire society into a prison for women.
