# Post-Malala Marriage

Isn't it romantic that Malala got married to a man she met in school. That a bullet to her head didn't stop her?

How lucky we are to be alive in a world where humans hunt down free thinkers on their school bus and shoot them with thier friends.

Every wedding photograph, every romance novel, every romance film, every romance scene, every romance book, every gathering USA society has shown attracts immigrants. People who give up their life to come to USA. Who make photographs, images, video, films, to show their groomed best.

To then raise children under Trump worship since June 16, 2015. To then wreck the public health. To stress people with saturated hate and mass dehumanization.

## Saturated Hate

Bring all the races together in one nation, then hate every race but white.

All a game that people support. Like NFL and NBA. It's just part of the games. Saturate people with disgusting hate and watch them suffer long hours of labor / work and point at allt he failures from the toxic society that Trump has created/ Rupert Murdoch seeded.

How anyone can act like a marriage is joyful and parenting is good under such situation? The only way is to deny the interconnected. The joy of meeting diverse humans, sharing diverse foods, to travel and explore.

But if you travel and explore in USA, you will find Fox News and Newsmax and clubs of hate. People who say "I love you" but praise hate.

This problem is not unique to USA. I have seen it where I lived in Africa, in South America, in the Middle East.

The 1954 Equation from MLK Jr. 

How ANYBODY can think they have escaped the toxic worship of guns and weapon systems. The Mutually Assured Destrucion that men like Putin and Trump rely upon to terrorize humanity.

Your one marriage overcoming all the hate oceans and all the hate lakes and all the hate ponds isn't made better by being a lucky person who overcame allthe shit.
