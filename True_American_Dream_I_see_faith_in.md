raw unedited terrible writing today

The True American Dream I see faith in

1. Don't give a shit about your neighbor kids playing sports unless they are on their way to rich sports stars path. And worship the rich sports stars. Neighborhood friendships and kids getting exercise be damned in favor of ultra-athletes with armies of medical doctors. That's the dream.

2. Fantasy of "The Waking Dead" will mayhem and murder

3. "The Last of Us" Fantasy of mayhem and murder, that's the American dream I see people believe in.

4. Fallout TV series, same

5. Disaster film after disaster film after disaster video game story where nearly everyone is dead, a wild pack of survivors with weapons fight zombies.

That's the American Dream that people actually are attracted to and seem to have honest faith in.

The Bible religion people dream of Taliban Islam values. Or Middle East murder wars / warlords over religion.

Do people REALIZE they have no positive dreams? I don't think they do.

The grey-rocking of MLK Jr's teachings about hate. The 1954 equation about hate.

The grey-rocking of Malala in USA. She sounds sensible. She has good values. But not good enough. Why?

I think Enter Shikari describes it, dream of being rich and famous, that's the sports fantasy dream. Inner city poor people dream of their child being a basketball or football / NFL NBA star and making it big.

Personally, I think we should just dive with it. I think USA already wrecked itself on world stage.

Ready Player One - Columbus Ohio year 2045. That dream isn't that bad. Americans already show they sell their souls to Twitter, Bluesky, TikTok, Apple and Android phone lifestyles. We live poor, spend time online, and strive towards an integrated life of inside and outside the matrix.

It seems to me that this is actually the nostalgia social society people want.

It isn't "The Walking Dead" with everyone murdering each other in the real streets.

We could have been leaders of world peace and promoted Malala - stood up against the Taliban after September 11, 2001 - but people grey-rocked Malala.

At the start, didn't I say my writing was a disaster today.
