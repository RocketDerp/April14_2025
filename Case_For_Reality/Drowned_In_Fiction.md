Enough is Enough.    
Have we all not seen enough?   
Children will need to understand reality and relate to it.   
We need to take Wiki systems seriously and not joke around and LOL-wash and "for the lulz" everything into a booby-trap. There are needs for sacred dreams and sacred reality.    

Why hasn't medical and drugs all been open sourced, Wikipedia style? Why do we hate our bodies and hate our health care. Is healthy goodness not incentive enough to strive for excellent teaching and knowledge, tutorials, videos, FAQ on medical? Can we put an end to scams and snake oil, is it not a common cause?
