"dyslexia is a genetic condition. It tends to run in families, meaning a child with a parent who has dyslexia has a higher chance of also developing the condition." - https://www.dyslexic.org.uk/genetics-of-dyslexia

"difficulties with spelling are common in individuals with autism. Some individuals with autism may produce more spelling errors, particularly in areas like orthographic errors, which involve misspelling the core word stem. This can be linked to their unique ways of processing information and potential difficulties with phonological and orthographic" - https://www.autism-help.org/comorbid-dysgraphia-autism.htm

"Autism can affect how individuals use language and grammar, leading to unique verbal and nonverbal communication patterns. This may include unusual word choice, atypical sentence structure, and difficulties with understanding social cues related to language. While some individuals with autism demonstrate exceptional language abilities, others may face challenges with grammar, vocabulary, and social language use." - https://www.research.chop.edu/cornerstone-blog/why-words-matter-chop-researchers-study-verbal-patterns-in-children-with-autism

"Children who use idiosyncrasies may also be prone to using neologisms, or made-up words that aren’t part of their native language.  A study by Joanne Volden and Catherine Lord (1991) found that children with autism spectrum disorder use neologisms and idiosyncrasies more often than neurotypical kids or mentally handicapped kids. They “were more likely to use words inappropriately that had no phonological or semantic similarity to the intended English word”." - https://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/idiosyncratic-speech/

"World Salad" is a very common 2025 insult to promote a form of language bigotry against autistic and other neurodiverse atypical patterns. Insulting people for their verbal and written communications efforts is egoism (anti-humanism) of the Tower of Babel metaphor, it is out-group hate, it is promoting eugenics that people with genetic or developmental language disorders are to be bullied and ridiculed for speaking, writing, art work... communications attempts. It is also often used to discriminate against poorer people who do not have access to more powerful computer tools to auto-correct mistakes, a "punching down" on the poor who do not have the latest and most lavish language technology tools. Also those who do not have access to the most exclusive and expensive higher education systems, more "punching down" on people that is part of systems that seek to exploit any perceived human weakness in public spaces, humanism. Also calling out and criticizing irregular use of language is a tool used to encourage anti-immigration, attacking people who are immigrates to nations or social spaces, undesired by many established residents. You will often witness people on social media have to apologize in advance, preface their message, that they are non-native writers and speakers - as they will be attacked and abused by those seeking to dehumanize / language bigotry values.

"James Joyce is renowned for his extensive and inventive use of neologisms, or newly coined words, particularly in his novels Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He experimented with language, creating words that often combined existing words, prefixes, and suffixes to achieve specific effects, such as humor, ambiguity, or symbolic meaning."
