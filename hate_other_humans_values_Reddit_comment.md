> It’s the same throughout history. A lot of people want to blame others for their own misfortune and gravitate to a bombastic personality that promises them greatness by ensuring the “others” suffer. We never learn from history because human nature is very very slow to change.

Agreed. People have always flocked to fiction storytelling and hyper-reality venues. Donald Trump turned Twitter into a media cult, like The Bible verses streaming in a Church. It's a very old game, people adore messages from "Sky Daddy". We haven't confronted or changed this pattern of behavior in any significant way. Elon Musk understood how to become "Sky Daddy God", he purchased Twitter in 2022 because he saw what Donald Trump was doing.
