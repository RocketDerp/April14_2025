Without study, people do not see it.

Without study of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1954 education and teachings, very few people see the common problem of all time periods, all cultures, all languages, all ages, all races, all geography, all nations.

&nbsp;

"Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong. It's wrong to throw our lives away in riotous living. No matter if everybody in Detroit is doing it, it's wrong. It always will be wrong, and it always has been wrong. It's wrong in every age and it's wrong in every nation. Some things are right and some things are wrong, no matter if everybody is doing the contrary. Some things in this universe are absolute." - February 28, 1954

"Jesus is not an impractical idealist; he is the practical realist." - December 25, 1957

&nbsp;

Let's take the USA for example.

USA is not founded on the Bible or Quran, "old world order", where you can not amend and rewrite the book. The USA is founded on a "new world order" of 1776 reason thinking where you can amend the constitution.

Nothing legally prevents, it is not against the law, to Amend the Constitution of the United States of America. Michael Moore from Flint Michigan pointed this out loudly in public.

'It's too bad you have to be 35 to be president,' Moore said. 'We put that in the constitution, the Founding Fathers, because people died at 38 or 40 back then. Y'know, we need to lower that. If that was lowered to 30 ...' - https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6663337/Michael-Moore-says-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-allowed-run-president.html

It is entirely legal and possible to change even to put in a specific person who is an exception to laws about country of birthplace, age, etc.

"In 2020, an estimated 4.6 billion people were over the age of 28 worldwide. This represents approximately 60.6% of the total global population at the time, which was around 7.88 billion people."

We could have picked a leader from ANYWHERE in the world, and put THEIR SPECIFIC NAME and IDENTITY (a single person) as an exception into the USA Constitution.

&nbsp;

People flock to hate. People prize hate. People value hate. Look all over the world, look at social media every hour of every day. People prize hate and war as entertainment. Reminder: This message started with context of February 28, 1954 equations from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. - which in further context, was a decade after World War Two that was spanning Japan / Germany / etc.

At what point do educated, Internet connected (Wikipedia available easily and quickly, at almost no cost, even advertising free) Americans (since year 2010), people of the Untied States of America face up to The February 28 1954 Equation.... they have not seen what is apparent with world study. That is why education, learning, being serious about war and being serious about conflicts matters.

We could have changed the laws to pick from 4.5 billion people anywhere in the earth to allow them to become The President of the United States of America. But... you know what we came up with in year 2020? Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Both old white men.

We are not only failing to grasp the history of psychology problems, [mass psychosis of World War Two, we are creating something even worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M)!  "In 1954, the world population was estimated to be 2,685,894,860 people" - we are not FACING UP to REALITY of what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr was telling us and recording for future (his teaching is still available in May 2025) in 1954.

We (the people) are attracted to hate. We are attracted to shit. Donald Trump isn't just an ordinary American, he is incredibly popular and very successful American at drawing crowds, influencing ideas, promoting hate, spreading hate, teaching hate! We *prize hate*, and we prize mocking and insulting the poopy-diapers and orange skin color of Donald Trump! We are attracted to the entertainment and amusement of mocking itself / total mockery White House.

"It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely." - LOVE (1972), Dr. Felice Leonardo Buscaglia Ph.D.
