4. The Matthew 4:19 trolling operation planned in 2013 would not end, as was published in 2014 ["The underlying aim, Surkov says, is **not to win the war**, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control."](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)

# Operation Matthew 4:19 was initiated in March 2013 even before November 2013 meeting.

1. [Some even claim that the World Wide Web trolling operation by billionaires against everyday people was initiated via Twitter in November 2012, a year before the billionaires met in November 2013 - the first claim, #1 on list above](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/)

2. The World Wide social media trolling operation was launched on the Web ***in early 2013*** but [not reported in Western news sources until middle of year 2014](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america)

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to [reject any evidence of the bamboozle](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192). We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s [simply too painful to acknowledge](https://www.salon.com/2024/10/25/helped-spread-right-wing-misinformation-during-recent-us-hurricanes/), even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”
