# Epstein Social Media Society

July 14, 2025 Epstein social media frenzy

Every social media platform is in a frenzy [since July 6, 2025](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-client-list-trump-administration) - as I write this July 14, 2025 - it has been non-stop social media orgy of lust for Epstein content.

The central sustained focused desires of the social media society shows all signs to be sexual fetishment of wealthy and media famous people. This seems to be the deepest most emotional motivation that USA people have in why they have abandoned democracy and goodness itself. The attraction to pimps of famous rich men sexual domination.

### Information Promises 

Promise made in early September 2024 seems to have been the one promsie that Donald Trump made that trutly motivates and concerns social media society. The lust for pinping details of rich / wealthy men's sexual fetishment content.

### Information Addiction

Media addiction is the heart of the Donald Trump era. Stimulation of society by antics politics, shocking behavior. The Russian Surkovian model of year 2012 applied to USA year 2025.

&nbsp;

From a July 14, 2025 perspective of mob mentality of USA society on social media, this is why people elected Donald Trump.

People are behaving as if this is the lie that they care about most in their life. That this is the motivation that is the most important.

&nbsp;

# Rich Men Sex Lives

The power of being the most famous star on television, radio, social media. The **Tony Clifton** content cravings the audience of social media keeps showing for over a decade regarding Donald Trump. The attraction to terrible, attraction to badness, attraction to ugly and fat and anti-intellectual.

This is it, this is the taste and cravings of a population. Attraction to lies, shit, bullshit.

## Kendrick Lamar on Drake

All year 2024 the socil media society was showing the lust for rich men sex content about Drake.

This goes very deep, since September 2013, in the Mass Mind / Mob Mentality of social media audiences.

# Attraction To Donald Trump

I think We The People of USA social media show an attraction to media superstars to self-harm.

"Grab Them By the Pussy" when you are a star. A media star.  

that is what Donald Trump did with the 2024 Election to the population of people who have sexual dreams and fantasy for a **"Daddy"** to sexually abuse them.

That is how fucked-up the United States of America users of Internet and social media are behaving on every possible platform currently.

That people sold out democracy and future of children (climate change, pollution in water, air, protection of food supply, etc) so billions of media comments could be made on dozens of social media platforms about rich powerful famous 79 year old men fucking over the world with sexual agression.

That is the emotional drive that seems people show the most care and concern about, that Donald Trump would release [sexual information that Donald Trump already had in his first term as President of the United States of Amererica back in August 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein).

### Mob Mentality USA society of July 2025

“Indeed, it is becoming ever more obvious that it is not famine, not earthquakes, not microbes, not cancer but man himself who is man’s greatest danger to man, for the simple reason that there is no adequate protection against psychic epidemics, which are infinitely more devastating than the worst of natural catastrophes. The supreme danger which threatens individuals as well as whole nations is a psychic danger. Reason has proved itself completely powerless, precisely because its arguments have an effect only on the conscious mind and not on the unconscious. The greatest danger of all comes from the masses, in whom the effects of the unconscious pile up cumulatively and the reasonableness of the conscious mind is stifled. Every mass organization is a latent danger just as much as a heap of dynamite is. It lets loose effects which no man wants and no man can stop. It is therefore in the highest degree desirable that a knowledge of psychology should spread so that men can understand the source of the supreme dangers that threaten them. Not by arming to the teeth, each for itself, can the nations defend themselves in the long run from the frightful catastrophes of modern war. The heaping up of arms is itself a call to war. Rather must they recognize those psychic conditions under which the unconscious \[tsunami-like\] bursts the dykes of consciousness and overwhelms it.”
― Doctor Carl Jung

### USA audiences wealth attraction

July 14, 2025 - The mania of USA society over Jeffrey Epstein, Private Jets, Private Islands, Status Symbols of Wealth, Real Estate Kings, Land Lords, Golf Courses, Donald Trump

It is not hard to witness social machine users all over the USA who are in mania over excitement of lusting for the wealth and power of Donald Trump / Epstein private island admiration. People driven by topics of: Private jets, fantasy islands, servants, private chefs, rich and famous, land lords, real estate kings. Nobody cares to let Malala put *actual young girls* on the popular Internet stage and listen to this as a GLOBAL COMMON PROBLEM of age 12 girls being abused by elders. Taliban are the elders, Donald Trump the elders who rule over little girls.

Year 2024 you saw the same with lust for Drake's power and control of young girls. Now in year 2025 it is Donald Trump power, Epstein private jet and island power. Rich people, powerful people, wealth status symbols is what draws social media sustained focus and attention, audience attention.

https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19899540


Malala Yousafzai started blogging anonymously for BBC Urdu at **the age of 11.** She wrote about her life under Taliban rule in Pakistan's Swat Valley.

How the elder men of society ruled over little girls, their sex life, their marriage, and how older men could use little girls. How girls are only for sexual pleasure of men, breeding babies, to be status symbols of older men. Malala gives voice to young girls: it isn't social media content about Drake, Trump, Epstein having wealth / private jets / fantasy islands / golf couches / servants and staff. Malala is about the actual girls who are being abused given a voice to stand up to Elder men who rule.

#### Impossible to Describe

The sewer of shit, the fetish USA population of social media users have demonstratein July 2025 over rich men is impossible to describe. The fetsh people have to bow down to a King of 79 year old man for sex topics and Drake content in year 2024 can't be described. What a fucked-up population of addicts to rich men worship, rich "Daddy" 79 year old fetishment.

Children have been given Donald Trump as a role model of behavior and leadership since year 2014. For over a decade, children age 8 and older have been told that Donald Trump is the aspiration of human achievement and goodness. What a fucked-up set of social media users who flock to shit and liars that make up the United States of America. This has been Hell itself since year 2015. And it gets worse every single day, every single week, every single month, every single year. Social media users, computer users, in USA have raised the children of society to worship Donald Trump values and thinking.

This shit is so bad, impossible to describe the ocean of toxic shit the United States of America social media nation has become.

5 hours and 9274 comments, that is HUGE engagement for Reddit. And that is only ONE post of this video, it was upvoted to the front page over and over in mutliple subreddits.

People are attracted to rich people's sex lives. Epstein private jet, private island. This frenzy of activity isn't about the girls being abused, this is about the rumor and shit-talking against the wealthy elite like Trump / Epstein who get on the Jumbotrons. Gawking at the rich and successful.

Again, social media users have grey-rocked Malala since publicaiton of her October 8, 2013 book. It isn't just the USA where elders of society punch down on little girls and sexually abuse them, force them into marriages, etc. This is a global problem of girls being manipulated and not educated on what is happening and the pattern of abuse by elders in power (Taliban elders, Donald Trump elders, Islamic Iran elders, Russian elders, etc, etc, etc). Support [the Pussy Riot band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp-KeVBNz0A), support Malala, give *young girls* a voice to speak up and *shut this shit down* in a preventative way, stop giving voice to the bullshit White House July 2025.
