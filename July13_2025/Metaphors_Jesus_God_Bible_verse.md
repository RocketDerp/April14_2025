## Context, Introduction

Lest you think *I take things to literally* as an atuistic, person, I suggest you accuse me of taking things too metaphorically. Let me know when you want to discuss James Joyce's 1924 onward publication of Finnegans Wake if you think I take things literally and at face value because I have autism spectrum disorrder.

"Most people can't **stand up for their convictions**, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, **everybody's not doing it**, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. February 28, 1954.

### Everybody in USA is avoiding "1 John 4:20" verse

This is not about if you *believe* in George Lucas **Star Wars 1977 film** as fiction or non fiction. This is not about if you *believe* in Muhammad's Quran stories of year 610 to year 635 as science fiction. Or Matthew, Mark, Luke, Jon, and who ever else you want to cite regarding science fiction, this is not about what you "believe". A lot of "atheists" are confused about metaphors.

####  "See, **everybody's not doing it**, so it must be wrong." - MLK Jr.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

Think about that statement:

1. Atheists are wrong
2. Believers are wrong
3. Joseph Campbell is saying EVERYONE, 100%, are wrong, who don't grasp metaphors.

Repeating: "Most people can't **stand up for their convictions**, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, **everybody's not doing it**, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right." - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. February 28, 1954.

Again and again, in the United States of America, what I find are atheists who do not teach **reading literacy** to science fiction book readers. They just are sick of the bullshit lies and manipulation of Christians / Bible readers. That kind of "atheist" is a reactionary who is sick of Christians. They are not educated on the difference between a gnostic Christian and a Sufi Muslim, they just are sick of the behavior of poor-literacy (non metaphor grasping) Christians.

Atheists in USA are almost entirely anti Levant Religions. They have never studied the Navajo Pollen Path, they are just concerned about "believe" aspect of Bible, believing if it isa  perfect factually correct 100% accurate book.  Star Wars is fiction, The Bible is science fiction.

Joseph Campbell worked with George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, if you don't know. The Official **science fiction** website run by Disney for Star Wars: https://www.starwars.com/news/mythic-discovery-within-the-inner-reaches-of-outer-space-joseph-campbell-meets-george-lucas-part-i
