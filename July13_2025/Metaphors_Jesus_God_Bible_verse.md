## Context, Introduction

Lest you think *I take things too literally* as an autistic,…  person, I suggest you accuse me of taking things too metaphorically. Let me know when you want to discuss James Joyce's 1924 onward publication of Finnegans Wake if you think I take things literally and at face value because I have autism spectrum disorder.

"Most people can't **stand up for their convictions**, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, **everybody's not doing it**, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. February 28, 1954.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is an **American** born in Atlanta, Georgia. And you know where I, Stephen Gutknecht, was born? Columbus, **Georgia**. I was born in 1969, but it did not take me that many years to be able to read a book and find MLK Jr's February 28, 1954 words printed on paper.

### Everybody in USA is avoiding "1 John 4:20" verse

This is not about if you *believe* in George Lucas **Star Wars 1977 film** as fiction or non fiction. This is not about if you *believe* in Muhammad's Quran stories of year 610 to year 635 as science fiction. Or Matthew, Mark, Luke, Jon, and who ever else you want to cite regarding science fiction, this is not about what you "believe". A lot of "atheists" are confused about metaphors.

####  "See, **everybody's not doing it**, so it must be wrong." - MLK Jr.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

Think about that statement:

1. Atheists are wrong
2. Believers are wrong
3. Joseph Campbell is saying EVERYONE, 100%, are wrong, who don't grasp metaphors.
4. The quote ends on the word "lies" - and guess what, that's the exact concern of this entire content I am composing. The word "lies" is written by Joseph Campbell, please turn your [Bible to verse "1 John 4:20*](https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm)... *lies, liars*.

Repeating: "Most people can't **stand up for their convictions**, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, **everybody's not doing it**, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right." - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. February 28, 1954.

Again and again, in the United States of America, what I find are atheists who do not teach **reading literacy** to science fiction book readers. They just are sick of the bullshit lies and manipulation of Christians / Bible readers. That kind of "atheist" is a reactionary who is sick of Christians. They are not educated on the difference between a Gnostic Christian and a Sufi Muslim, they just are sick of the behavior of poor-literacy (non metaphor grasping) Christians.

Atheists in USA are almost entirely anti Levant Religions. They have never studied the Navajo Pollen Path, they are just concerned about "believe" aspect of Bible, *believing* if it is a perfect factually correct 100% accurate history book. Star Wars is fiction, The Bible is science fiction.

Joseph Campbell worked with George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, if you don't know.

## Christian Nationalists, USA

As I compose this sentence July 18, 2025...

### "I Love Jesus" is WRONG

Stop being a reactionary atheist and focus on what has been said from the top of the very page that you are reading. 1. Atheist, 2. Bible Believer, 3. Metaphors.  That's the crisis. This is not a binary "Two Sides" issue, this is not "Both Sides", this is not a "two and only two sides to every story".  BOTH GROUPS do not grasp literacy of language, idioms, metaphors, science fiction storytelling!

1. Torah is science fiction
2. Bible is science fiction retcon of Torah, New Testament is reworking and rewriting elements of the Torah.
3. Mohammad's Quran is science fiction retcon of Bible and Torah. Most people in USA can't even answer correctly when you ask them: Who are the main character's in Mohammad's Quran stories told from year 610 to year 635?  People in USA don't even know that Mary and Jesus and Adan and Eve are in the Quran / Mosque! Jesus is in the Mosque / Quran storytelling! People don't even grasp that level of science fiction story reboots and Star Wars reboot science fiction conventions!

Get it right, fix this issue: ***"I Love Jesus"*** is wrong, incorrect. Read Bible verse "1 John 4:20" and correct the literacy problems of USA Christian Nationalist who do not grasp a translated and double-imported Levant storytelling book. (Double Imported: Levant to Rome, Rome to Spain, Spain to Americas in year 1492 onward).

### "I Love God" is incorrect!

Again, Bible verse "1 John 4:20"

### "I Hate Mexicans' is incorrect!

Again, Bible verse "1 John 4:20"

### "I Hate homosexuals and transgenders" is wrong!

Again, Bible verse "1 John 4:20"

### "I hate dirty homeless / immigrant smelly people" is wrong 

Proverbs 14:31

# Atheists are not fixing the metaphor literacy

Atheists are too busy promoting hate the out-group, just like Muslims are too busy hating on Jewish and Christians in their contest for **book supremacy** of the *one and only one true perfect correct nonfiction poetry story book* of Quran vs. Torah vs. Bible.  This is like Star Trek (Gene Roddenberry) fans of science fiction *hating upon* with Star Wars (George Lucas) fans. And one-media venue of Mosque vs. Church vs. Synagogue vs. Cinema vs. Shakespeare Globe Theater vs. Netflix Home Theater in the hotel room!

**Atheists are not fixing the literacy metaphor problems**, We The People of the United States of America have a We The People crisis of literacy metaphors.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

### This is North America

What the hell is wrong with the Navajo Pollen Path? Why are Americans using **Levant** imported story books and saying they are the *one and only one perfect book*, when we have awesome American-made material? We eat the local American-made food, the American-rain water we drink, why the hell do we adopt a imported **Levant** storybook and don't even grasp the metaphors? Do we still think we are part of the Roman Empire, the **King James** Bible? How many Americans in July 2025 can even NAME the year 1820 **Thomas Jefferson (Founding Father)** Bible?

"to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in *Ulysses*" - age 83, Skywalker Ranch California filmed by George Lucas for the audiences of Star Wars and other Hollywood films.
