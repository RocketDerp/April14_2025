The hole USA society has dug is so deep, the media content addiction people have to antics politics, shock Donald Trump behavior, insulting and hate inspired by Donald Trump is over 10 years. Even if Donald Trump is removed, people are so addicted to mocking and hate, setting direction will be incredibly painful because the core issue of addiction to mocking and hate is unlikely to be addressed. So much resentment, bewilderment, confusion, misunderstandings from the 10+ years of [nonstop contradictions](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html). This is a new situation, only possible with advanced media systems.

Saturday July 12, 2025 night

I was burned out by this in 2015, the rise of MAGA and the Internet Research Agency delivering their payloads since March 2013. I telephoned the Pentagon in 2015 before the IRA and Cambridge Analytica got widespread attention. It took two years for people to become addicted to the style of insult, dismissal, mocking (even reading it from others, strictly passive consumption as a spectator was addicting people, attracting audiences).

None of these media addiction problems went away with the November 2020 election loss by Donald Trump. January 6, 2021 build up most people were blind to, in psychological denial of group behavior / cult behavior. Or an attitude of insult and mocking that people are in a cult or under the influence of Fox News - and no sustained serious effort to defend / educate about cult programming as rescue. Jen Senko's [The Brainwashing of My Dad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad) had been published since March 2016, but people did not rally behind it, did not consider it good enough to repeat and repeat on social media.

All of year 2024 it was obvious things were even worse. That computer media systems had advanced from year 2016 and the now practiced style of mimicking Donald Trump social media interaction was joined by Elon Musk.

#### Systems, Systemic, Addiction

At heart is people's attraction to the power of social media computer systems to dehumanize and hate upon the out-group. This mockery is not about fixing problems, it is content addiction to the problems. Using government systems and processes to hate and dehumanize the out-groups is core to MAGA values and attraction. And Fox News is a weaponzied out-group hate televagelism system.

#### Grim Future

There are now so many people in the influencer / content provider roles entirely addicted and structured to now mock,insult, hate upon MAGA / Donald Trump. Meme addled sickness, Fox News addeled content consumers are not being rescued and fundamental hate and dehumanization condmeed, it isan out-group sports mentality / competitition. It is this addiction to providing commentary on the out-groups that only modern advanced media systems could feed. Event ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence have been trained on all of this social media hate centered around MAGA and Donald Trump since year 2014.

People do not take seriously that classic religions, such as Middle East Torah / Quran / Bible, are media addiction to science fiction stories. And the out-group non-believer, infidel, gentile, atheist patterns. Mosque, Temple, Synagoge, Church and clergy are all media venues and contest providers. We are not in the realm of politics, we are in the realm of every day all the time media systems, with instant notificaiton and reactions. 

Like how sports become much more than scheduled games...sports stars,trades,injuries, death of a sports star in a travel accident, sexual affairs and arrests, it becomes an informaiton system addiction that goes far beoyond the scheduled games and into any-time notifications (breaking news).

That is the crisis we have in July 2025. If Donald Trump is completely removed, the media addiction (Russian media invasion since March 2013 inclusive) has become core to USA society. People not only do not wish to learn about the War Against Reality, they are bored by stable elections, politics, governing. React-commenting and reading other people reacting has become normal routine addiction like constant cups of coffee or energy drinks. Religion people can be in the same media addiction patterns in world beore Internet- now with digital video, global connection, meme thinking - it is far more intense and enaging. Weaponized by Putin in late 2012 and deployed in March 2013... and now since December 2022 expanded and enhanced by ChatGPT and all the other emerging media-engaging content-providing artificial intelligence systems. And other nations states and entire media networks have copied (copycat) the success of Donald Trump's hate and unpredictable all the time content events. Those who hate upon Donald Trump may even be more addicted to the content than MAGA and Donald Trump supporters themselves.

On the world stage,people are already accustomed to USA films and music / Hollywood culture, video games, etc.And now USA population is entirely addicted to the techniques and styles of Surkovian White House / Donald Trump antics politics. People who hate the USA and want to see wealthy rich nation fail, arrogant fat Americans, are thrilled to watch our nation self-harm with anti-reality fiction bullshit media content addictions.

What does this community comments say about Donald Trump MAGA hate, both for and against Trump. And this man who owned the house does not desire the media message obsession, Donald Trump desires hate with and against him.
