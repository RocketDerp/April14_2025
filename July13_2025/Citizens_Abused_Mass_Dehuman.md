# Citizens Abused

Citinizes abused by billionares.   
Mass Dehumanization by billionares.

What I saw first hand in 1998 in Bellueve, Washington disturbed me to the core. The loophole of the mind.

# Egoism: "Smarter Than Others"

May people seem to think that people grasp this.

I do not.

My prediction of the Arab Spring in December 2009, a year before it became world famous - and my Facebook and other social media participations all year 2010 - leading to my travel December 3, 2025 to Algeria.

Religions - ChatGPT - people *do not realize* they are being manipulated! The ELIZA effect is real. Neil Postman's 1985 book about television news is more than a decade before 1996 Fox News, the problem of media ecology was known 11 years prior!

“But it is much later in the game now, and ignorance of the score is inexcusable. To be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple.”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,1985

People believe religion science fiction poetry is real, just as Fox News fiction wealth televangelism is taken as reality. Or hyper reality, more attractive than factual nonfiction reality.

#### Trump is Religion

Trump fiction is monomyth religion, mythology.

What of the people who realize it is fiction?

Are they rescuing Americans or finding attraction to insulting and mocking.

And I spent years living in the Middle East (Amman, Jodan) analyzing this problem. And I never stopped analyzing this media consumers behavior.

What happens is that Quran media addicts do not rescue the Torah media addicts, the Bible media addicts do not rescue the Quran media addicts. The rare exception is Malala. She tries to rescue all three, she borrows blends in scieence physics, Martin Niemöller, she visits Martin Luther King Jr's Christian church to give translation, she brings in Hindu and Buddhist mythology, and she creates her own from current education.

It is the lack of emotional rescue of MAGA believers. Fox News believers.  
It is the lack of intellectual rescue.  
It is the lack of cult deprogramming. 

Why is Jen Sanko's book since March 2016 not constantly asserted by social media users? Instead, we get "orange skin color" (racial skin color associations) asserted constantly on social media. Poeple enjoy the "fisn in a barrel" mocking and insulting ease, not the hard work of addressing all the world religions and world peace aspects of people not rescuing the emotions and intellectual of the addicted around. Malala's book was published October 8, 2013 - right at the rise of Donald Trump's massive success at becoming the center of every hour of every day attention in every media system. Turning Trump religion behaivor into every media venue, not just a Church or Mosque.

##### Neil Postman Correct in 1985

I don't believe people who joke and insult and mock are in on this. Again, the Levant religion dynamics of Quran vs. Torah vs. Bible, all three are science fiction, and people insult and mock *the out-group others*, without Neil Postman / Marshal McLuhan / Joseph Campbell / James Joyce level of grasping the crisis.

"Solution for COVID - Inject bleach into yourself

Solution for wildfires- Sweep the forest floors

Solution for floods - Ring bells

Is there no end to this guys genius?

Nuke the hurricanes"

&nbsp;

These are all *fiction* answers to problems. They are mythological, monomyth, they are the fiction religion is composed of. And you do not see that level of awareness in those joking / insulting / mocking. People are not rescuing the emotinally abused, mentually abused, by status symbols (billionare) Donaald Trump / Rupert Murdoch / etc.

"For the life of me, I will never fucking understand how some people swear he’s a genius."

&nbsp;

That is the crisis, people don't want to address this with Neil Postman's 1985 and the fiction faith of religions as science fiction, nor invoke [The Brainwashing of My Dad is a 2015 American documentary film directed by Jen Senko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad) in year 2025.

"How the Trump shooting supercharged beliefs in a divine right of MAGA"

How the gun assasination attempt on Donald Trump a year ago, shortly after the introduction of the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible, supercharged divine right to those who believe and do not grasp religion stories are science fiction (mythology).

This is exactly the problems people are not rescuing citizens from, emotonal rescue, intellectual rescue. Even if Donald Trump dies from a travel accident or heart attack and is no longer POTUS, dead people does not stop religion science fiction followers (Mohammad and Jesus are both long dead for thousands of years, but the crisis of people needing rescued from emotional fiction storytelling, intellctual rescue still persists. See Also L Ron Hubbard and Scientology).

##### Bad written

Like all my writing these years, brain damage from information warfare interacting with my autism is extreme and this is incomplete, not edited, unfinished, mistakes, errors.
