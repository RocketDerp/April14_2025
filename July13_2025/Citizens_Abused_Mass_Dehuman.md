# Citizens Abused

Citinizes abused by billionares.   
Mass Dehumanization by billionares.

What I saw first hand in 1998 in Bellueve, Washington disturbed me to the core. The loophole of the mind.

# Egoism: "Smarter Than Others"

May people seem to think that people grasp this.

I do not.

My prediction of the Arab Spring in December 2009, a year before it became world famous - and my Facebook and other social media participations all year 2010 - leading to my travel December 3, 2025 to Algeria.

Religions - ChatGPT - people *do not realize* they are being manipulated! The ELIZA effect is real. Neil Postman's 1985 book about television news is more than a decade before 1996 Fox News, the problem of media ecology was known 11 years prior!

“But it is much later in the game now, and ignorance of the score is inexcusable. To be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple.”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,1985

People believe religion science fiction poetry is real, just as Fox News fiction wealth televangelism is taken as reality. Or hyper reality, more attractive than factual nonfiction reality.

#### Trump is Religion

Trump fiction is monomyth religion, mythology.

What of the people who realize it is fiction?

Are they rescuing Americans or finding attraction to insulting and mocking.

And I spent years living in the Middle East (Amman, Jodan) analyzing this problem. And I never stopped analyzing this media consumers behavior.

What happens is that Quran media addicts do not rescue the Torah media addicts, the Bible media addicts do not rescue the Quran media addicts. The rare exception is Malala. She tries to rescue all three, she borrows blends in scieence physics, Martin Niemöller, she visits Martin Luther King Jr's Christian church to give translation, she brings in Hindu and Buddhist mythology, and she creates her own from current education.

It is the lack of emotional rescue of MAGA believers. Fox News believers.  
It is the lack of intellectual rescue.  
It is the lack of cult deprogramming. 

Why is Jen Sanko's book since March 2016 not constantly asserted by social media users? Instead, we get "orange skin color" (racial skin color associations) asserted constantly on social media. Poeple enjoy the "fisn in a barrel" mocking and insulting ease, not the hard work of addressing all the world religions and world peace aspects of people not rescuing the emotions and intellectual of the addicted around. Malala's book was published October 8, 2013 - right at the rise of Donald Trump's massive success at becoming the center of every hour of every day attention in every media system. Turning Trump religion behaivor into every media venue, not just a Church or Mosque.

##### Bad written

Like all my writing these years, brain damage from information warfare interacting with my autism is extreme and this is incomplete, not edited, unfinished, mistakes, errors.
