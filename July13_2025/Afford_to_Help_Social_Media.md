# Afford To Help Social Media

I have seen plenty of discussions on social media about people in Palestine needing money to pay for food and people in other nations saying they can't afford to help every person who is in a war zone situation. Same with Ukraine being bombarded by Russia.

Same goes for domestic violence, weomen abused by clergy / family / marriage / relationships.

### Thought Terminating Behavior

But why does it have to be a thought-terminating behavior that you can not help every person in need of housing, food, medical care,

# Absent from Social Media

Repeating and repeating

## Second Bill of Rights January 1944

[January 1944 Second Bill of Human Rights for USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights). Criticize the USA, even if you have never visited the USA or lived in the USA. Pleae read waht it says in January 1944, five months before D-Day Normandy France Nazi Germany.

## Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan

I do not see Palestine supporters, IDF Israel criticis, asserting and repeating Malala. This costs nothing, this is not a money afforance issue, it is about *goodness itself, world peace, all hate in all places*.

## Martin Luther King Jr

MLK Jr had more to say than just black skin color. He talked about poverty, long-term asserting of reformation of interpretation of The Bible, hate and violence.

This costs nothing to repeat and assert on social media. You can afford to criticize with well-articulated and deep thinking of MLK Jr.

# Blaming "The Media"

Fox News has made it very popular to blame "the mainstream media", as did Rush Limbaugh make this a constant reptitive talking point. Social media users have adopted this Rush Limbaugh and Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump blaming of "the media".

Do you have the money, wealth, skills, energy and time to start your own "the media"? No.

But you are on *social media*. And you can:

1. Repeat Andrew Postman February 2017 about media problems https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley
2. Repeat Neil Postman 1985 about media problems https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/41963.Neil_Postman
3. Repeat Carl Sagan January 1994 about media problems https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1994/01/09/with-science-on-our-side/9e5d2141-9d53-4b4b-aa0f-7a6a0faff845/
4. Repeat Carl Sagan 1995 about media problems https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11337601-science-is-more-than-a-body-of-knowledge-it-is

Repeat sustained focus in Neil Postman's 184 page book, Carl Sagan's book from year 1995. Beg social media users to join you in getting on the same page of the problems. And Neil Postman's 1985 book is not about blaming a political party or specific religion, it is about grasping how technology brain rot works itself. It is written 11 years *before Fox News*, and it blames Fox News. It is a way to be deeper and more serious about the topic by looking at social media computer usage (meme, LOL, LMAO, amusement, libreal tears, leopards at my face, Donald Trump mockery / Elon Musk Twitter mockery) from a year 1985 perspective.
