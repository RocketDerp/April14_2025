I do not see Palestine supporters, IDF Israel criticis, asserting and repeating Malala. This costs nothing, this is not a money afforance issue, it is about *goodness itself, world peace, all hate in all places*.

## Martin Luther King Jr

MLK Jr had more to say than just black skin color. He talked about poverty, long-term asserting of reformation of interpretation of The Bible, hate and violence.

This costs nothing to repeat and assert on social media. You can afford to criticize with well-articulated and deep thinking of MLK Jr.
