## Disowning family, blocking friends

I have seen time nnd time again people sharing personal stories about blocking and disowning friends over Doanld Trump support and MAGA since year 2015.

## Not Rescuing Americans

Intelectual survivor guilt of not being able to overcome the [Cambridge Analytica weaponized executive function mind manipulation since year 2013](../Quotes_Pile/Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md). Not being able to save the future of the USA since year 2013, not being able to rescue neighbors, friends, coworkers.

# Against Trump, Against MAGA

The problem is that hate for hate against Trump, matching MAGA hate and dehumzniation is not seeing the forest problem for the trees. 

We are not dealing with domestic brainrot only of HDTV and meme culture, we lost an information war to Russia nad people can not even name the players or describe. People can not name dates, players, techniques. [Surkovian Onion Eating abounds](../Quotes_Pile/Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md)

## Stress Kills / Stress Lords

To deny that MAGA "high energy" comes from stress, hate, dehumanization - wartime kind of attitudes of military commanders...

The stress that comes from middle of the night antics and rage on social media from government leaders. Health care system in constant dehumanization values. Future of children and society in denial of climate change, attacking allies, not defending against enemy mental and emotional manipulation attacks.

Rick Roderick 1993 quote about breakdown of society

## Comprehension, Undrestanding

back to the start of this page with the "Speak Fox News?" breakdown of langauge. There is also a breakdown of science comprehension that was apparent during the December 2019 onward COVID-19 pandemic. A breakdown of comprehension, interpretation, in the face of complexity.
