# Putin Media Invasion

Since the March 2013 onward Internet Research Agency manipulation of United States of America mass mind, I think this is the long-term intended outcome. Russia wants Americans to hate upon Americans. Republicans forming MAGA hate and dehumanization group, the hate values and mass dehumanization of Donald Trump. Then Democrats adopt hate and dehumanization of MAGA, *inspired by the massive success of Donald Trump / Elon Musk / Twitter / Truth Social / Rupert Murdoch Fox News* hate systems.

Documented validated information from **year 2014 onward** shows that Russia manipulated emotional and intellectual responses (seeded arguing and hate) to pandemic / COVID-19 virus, measles, vaccination. BBC, August 24, 2018: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

The hate of measles and COVID-19 topics swirl around Donald Trump, the hate of Americans by Americans. Science vs. fiction. Reality vs. anti-reality, that's the Russian "War Against Unreality" as described in year 2014: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/
