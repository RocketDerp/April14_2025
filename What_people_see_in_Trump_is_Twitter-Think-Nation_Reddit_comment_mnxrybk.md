>  I'll never understand what people see in Trump.

A man over age 70 using Twitter on his Apple iPhone, exactly what Elon Musk understood in purchasing Twitter in 2022 and having more power than God over the population.

People accept Tweets as messages from God. There never was any supernatural, the Bible is just a media platform and the Church a media venue.

Twitter had reach so far beyond Rupert Murdoch's media empire, Donald Trump knew how to use media machines to dehumanize and deliver the hate messages in the right sequence, and his suggestion to have the Kremlin work with Cambridge Analytica in November 2012 was the (perhaps) the most significant media ecology choice ever made in all human history (so far). The partnership of the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica to create 5,000 artificial reality screen games for every World Wide Web media platform was the greatest leap forward in practical mythology and fiction storytelling ever.
