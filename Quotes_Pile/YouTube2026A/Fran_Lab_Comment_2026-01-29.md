I like your channel generally, Fran, but am uninterested in your politics.   
Do agree that the incarceration industry is out of control, and that charity should begin with family, friends, and neighbors.   
But Ayn Rand would say that charity and virtue signaling are vice. Do you understand why?   
Perhaps large numbers of schizos and addicts are on the streets because Americans are reluctant to use force, to make them do otherwise.   
Perhaps freedom, is the freedom to starve to death. You subsidize a thing, you get more of it.

"GNU Religion", yha. Anti-compassion, anti-empathy. Technology hardware lab. Machine lover, humanism attacker. Technology lover, billionaire lover. "Umm, sorry, I do not really make content. Maybe it would be **electronic projects, 3d printing** and stuff. Need a camera."

"Listening to you I can only think, "WTF???".    You begin by lamenting, "there is nothing we can do".   Edward Bernay who wrote 'the book', "Propaganda" says that the main purpose and goal of all propaganda is to make the people believe there is nothing they can do.  I can only surmise that some of the information you are basing your arguments on is in fact propaganda.  At 3:02 you let us know how you really feel about your country, "what's America going to do? I don't know Probably not good things".  Then followed up by a bunch of obvious symptoms of a serious case of TDS.  

America is still the best country in the world.  Even without knowing you I have no doubt that it has given you more and allowed you to self actualize more than any other culture in all of history (recorded or not).  We live at an amazing time in the absolute best place to be.  Although it's hard to see for some we are making real progress towards solving many age old problems.  We might even get peace in the middle east.  Sure it's never pretty or easy getting anything worthwhile but we are doing the work that needs to be done in the world.   Don't be debbie downer because CNN told you the sky is falling.  Young people see and hear this and it does them real harm.  You are an American so understand how lucky you are and do something with our god given freedoms.  I know you do but this kind of talk you just gave is defeatist for no reason... because we really are winning."

* My emphasis: "for no reason", "we really are winning" - but rejecting everything Malala and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. educated us about. MLK Jr influence has been shit out since year 2012, especially on the topic of hate. Pollyanna. Denial of Putin's Internet influence and behavior changes since year 2013.
