I like your channel generally, Fran, but am uninterested in your politics.   
Do agree that the incarceration industry is out of control, and that charity should begin with family, friends, and neighbors.   
But Ayn Rand would say that charity and virtue signaling are vice. Do you understand why?   
Perhaps large numbers of schizos and addicts are on the streets because Americans are reluctant to use force, to make them do otherwise.   
Perhaps freedom, is the freedom to starve to death. You subsidize a thing, you get more of it.
