"Why the Democrats Keep Leaning Right"    
Rebecca Watson (Skepchick)   

Left vs. Right is brain rot. The Founding Fathers of USA made no such distinction, and the Great Seal of the USA is about 13 steps of thinking system upward, with rear and front (New World Order, Old World Order) vs 13 vertical. 

It's like the clergy teaching at the church that there is a team evil and a team good. And you can choose to follow South Park Satan in the White House. As if Satan is a VALID choice. Right-wing in France origins of seating was fiction Bible King vs. nonfiction science.

Good vs. evil is not a valid choice. Evil is not a valid choice!  the 1-bit programming by Rupert Murdoch and others is basically that evil is a valid choice.

@8:07 how did we end up with Donald Trump? Fiction addictions. Reality TV. Donald Trump provides fiction storytelling unlike any other politician. People can not resist their attraction to Trump the creative mythology storyteller.

Certainly, gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion high respect; their business unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and, above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own.

But, his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you; to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.

Edmund Burke, Speech to the electors of Bristol (1774)

I didn't put my effort into my reply, but people downplaying the threat of Trump is so common of a billionaire talking point. Trump is not a danger, don't worry. Anti Dr. Bandy X Lee messaging.
