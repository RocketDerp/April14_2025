"Why the Democrats Keep Leaning Right"    
Rebecca Watson (Skepchick)   

Left vs. Right is brain rot. The Founding Fathers of USA made no such distinction, and the Great Seal of the USA is about 13 steps of thinking system upward, with rear and front (New World Order, Old World Order) vs 13 vertical. 

It's like the clergy teaching at the church that there is a team evil and a team good. And you can choose to follow South Park Satan in the White House. As if Satan is a VALID choice. Right-wing in France origins of seating was fiction Bible King vs. nonfiction science.

Good vs. evil is not a valid choice. Evil is not a valid choice!  the 1-bit programming by Rupert Murdoch and others is basically that evil is a valid choice.
