# Media Ecology and Earworms in Finnegans Wake

## Earwicker: A Sonic Weaver

Humphrey Earwicker’s very name fuses ear (hearing) with wicker (weaving), casting him as a living conduit of sound. In media-ecological terms, he embodies the medium itself—an environment through which voices, rumors, and rhythms circulate. As an auditory “web,” Earwicker both channels and entangles the novel’s polyphonic tapestry.

## Earworm as Meme and Medium

- An earworm is a tune or phrase that loops involuntarily in the mind, much like a media meme.  
- Finnegans Wake behaves as a literary earworm: its refrains (“riverrun,” “avoice from afire…”) lodge in readers’ consciousness.  
- This looping effect illustrates how media environments replicate themselves, embedding their patterns within our cognitive landscape.

## John 1:1 and the Primordial Earworm

“In the beginning was the Word…” presents the Logos as the archetypal earworm: the primal vibration that undergirds existence. In Finnegans Wake, Joyce riffs on this biblical echo, turning language itself into a sonic force that persists beyond conscious control. The text’s incessant wordplay thus becomes a perpetual audio-environment, where meaning and sound coil around each other.

| Earwicker       | Ear + Wicker      | The medium incarnate, weaving sonic currents through the text |
| Earworm         | Mind-looping tune | A memetic pattern that exemplifies involuntary media uptake  |

## Beyond Earworms: Further Avenues

1. **Touch and Typography**  
   Explore how the novel’s unusual layout and typography create a tactile media environment—text as texture.  
2. **Visual “Earprints”**  
   Investigate the “eye-rhymes” Joyce embeds: visual puns that echo the earworm principle in sight.  
3. **Digital Wake**  
   Consider how Finnegans Wake functions in today’s networked age: tweets, memes, and viral loops as modern earworms.
