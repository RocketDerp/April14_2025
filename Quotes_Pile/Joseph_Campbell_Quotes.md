"And now to return to the name of Dante. There is a wonderful passage in [Dante’s Convivio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convivio) where he speaks about the interplay in Europe of these two ideals: the ideal, as he says, of Jerusalem, which for him was carried on in the idea of the church; and the idea of Rome, which for him is carried on in the idea of the Emperor. He says, “These are the two arms of the almighty, and they are not to become confused.” He spoke out strongly against the political ambitions of the Pope, and said that the church’s function is not social; the church’s function is spiritual. And it is the function of the King, the function of the secular government, to take care of worldly affairs. And these two worlds work together in the way of spiritual inspiration, the reference to the mysteries of awe and so forth, and in the way of social organization.

In other words, the function of society has been removed from the mythological by the Greeks, and the Romans, and the Europeans; it has become a secular affair.

Furthermore, says Dante, “If you have two friends, and one of them is truth, truth is the friend that you must honor.”

In other words, he was already pointing toward the Renaissance, when the claims of archaic science, which inhabited the whole mythology which he himself presented, were to be challenged and broken up. First, wonderful Copernicus putting the sun in the middle; then the discovery that the planets were revolving not in perfect circle, but in ellipses—this broke Aristotle and Plato and Ptolemy’s universe to bits."
