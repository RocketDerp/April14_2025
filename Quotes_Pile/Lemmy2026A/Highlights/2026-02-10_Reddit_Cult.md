Reddit social is a cult of compulsive MAGA USA

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Reddit is a cult of compulsive MAGA behaviors.

1. People on Reddit always blame "the government" for the problems in the USA.

2. We The People on Reddit are in a cult of blaming "the dems" for problems instead of seeing a USA national mental health crisis that needs to be directly addressed. Cult of MAGA media, cult of Trump media, cult of Musk media, cult of Murdoch media.

3. People on Reddit are always posting Twitter (X) screen shots from the Elon Musk platform in February 2026. Any hour of day or night you see it on /r/All - this cult behavior of billionaire Elon Musk as a source of "content", engagement cultists.

4. People who comment and post on Reddit have zero self-awareness they are in a cult to Donald Trump, MAGA, Elon Musk.

5. The problem has built up over time. There is no sense of time passing on Reddit. It is like a casino with blinking lights and slot machine noises all the time drowning out the passage of time. Reddit consumers of Trumpism MAGA USA do not show awareness that this is Donald Trump's second term in office and Reddit users behave constantly as if Trump only took world power a few weeks ago. This timeless mockery of Trump has been going on since June 16, 2015 - nearly eleven full years. The cult symptom of time loss and mental blackouts from consuming so much **Trump MAGA USA propaganda** content. 

&nbsp;

The cult faith on Reddit social is that more mocking, more jokes, more insulting Trump will remove Trump from office. That taunting a crazy / dementia / senile man of 80 years old who has the most powerful military weapons is a *good idea*. The cult is constantly taunting and mocking. It is a feedback loop between Truth Social and Reddit media systems.

Reddit comment creators and shit-posting users are enablers to Trumpism / MAGA. Donald Trump is a leader of shit-posting and shit-commenting and Reddit is a cult of following Trump as a leader. Reddit users are not free thinkers and do not promote free thinking. Reddit users are slavish reactionary thinkers who constantly import MAGA content from Truth Social, Twitter and Fox News to spread it as far and as wide as possible. Reddit platform has become a cult temple of compulsive addiction gatherings... to Trump images, MAGA topics, and Trump writings.

* “Assessing dangerousness is different from making a diagnosis: it is dependent on the situation, not the person. Signs of likely dangerousness due to mental disorder can become apparent without a full diagnostic interview and can be detected from a distance, and one is expected to err, if at all, on the side of safety when the risk of inaction is too great.”
