This Lemmy user replied to my message with the street-gang symbolism messages of saying GitHub posting was "cursed". And did not respond to my reply. Banality of other users seems to be the game afoot.

"Please seek psychological help. The LLM chatbots are giving you false confidence in your ideas. They are flawed tools that will stroke your ego for the most outlandish, nonsensical ideas. Your closing sentence regarding self-harm and the wasting of a marriage are concerning. Please talk to professionals instead of chatbots."

Notice the absence of any book quotes, any links, any author names, just telling people they need mental help for doing software development learning. 

In my day, we said "RTFM", we didn't tell people to seek a doctor. And even then, you educated people in the 1970's and 1980's about ELIZA effect, you learned from it, you didn't depend on USA medical system of $180/hour private sessions over MIT artificial intelligence tools.
