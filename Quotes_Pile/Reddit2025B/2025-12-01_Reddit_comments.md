I am revisitng this posting from Reddit yesterday where I commented about the Russian Surkov / Putin techniques of Kremlin media since Y2K.

In the context of "right-wing media bubble" (previous message in thread) - has the Middle East right-wing media bubble felt enough pain with out-group hate? How many more thousands of years of "Dictator in the Sky" Allah / Jesus / Yaweh of Torah / Quran / Bible do you need to see that fiction itself is what the Founding Fathers of the USA were addressing? Science reality vs. science fiction monomyth Bible vs. Quran vs. Torah. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      
BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but **with the planet**. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.
CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about.
