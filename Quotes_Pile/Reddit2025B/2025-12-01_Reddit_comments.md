BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but **with the planet**. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

Young people that seemed to have no idea that a hamburger for $18.00 was rediculous in year 2008 when there were far better items on the menues all around. And that the labor of 15 minutes to make a shitty hamburger and cost of quality ingredients in Texas in 2009 was about $2.00. You could get decent cheap beefsteak dishes at Mexican places for $9.00 if you went away from the trendy spots. This unversity generation seems to have spread all over the USA now. Hell, Whataburger in Texas was decent for the price back in 2008. I think some of these kids including eating to go / eating out twice a day rolled into a long-term school loan.

In a "War Against Reality", with Cambridge Analytica, this user can not expaalin thier compusive "loony" attacking of a American ciitizen. This was not my Reddit posting, it is a topic about White Hosue and media ecology / media warfare against the USA free press. That the disturbed behavior of Russia attacking Ukraine, the disturbed behavior of RFK r over autistm should not invoke confrontation of mass man irrational behavior. That it is "loony" to stand up to the media enviornment, just as Don Q stands up to the machines of windmills. The compulsive media environment behavior over insisting that China is the only topic of concern, without any evidence of citations on China, while again and again citation of Russia keep beingprovided. The very assertion of nonfiction real name authors invokes out-group hate on Reddit. This person thinks that a link provided over and over, in almost every reply, to Washington Monthly about Cambridge Analytica and the IRA isn'ta bout 300 million people in USA. Not about just htier own personal usage of YouTube and Reddit.https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/ - (Martin Longman) they think that I would WAN TO KNOW thier personal Internet usage and that the topic of the White House attacking media outlets is about their personal usage of YouTube. It is the information war that has been raging in society that is driving EVERYONE loony, and the denial over mass man / mob mentality regarding it is why it has continued into a second term in office of Trump now with adding RFK Jr's attack on autism. "I read AP news as my ONLY news source, and that's because I don't really like how Reuters app is." - zero concern for rescue of MAGA and rescue of Russia from war and hate, only concerned about egoism of one single person and attacking and insulting people who commented on Reddit about White House and Kremlin media ecology.

"You have not sold me on anything I care about because you've sent sooooo much time arguing against a position I simply don't have the capacity to have. I literally don't know enough about this platform to care like you seem to think I do." - do not have the capacity to gain knowledge? To ome to reddit, encounter a link to Washington Monthly about an agreement in year 2012 about Donald Trump, and have the capacity to learn from a professional author who wrote it (Martin Longman)? The person is using Reddit to scream at me about my message, but only seems to think the problem of mob mentality (and Reddit automated media banning) is a topic of two and only two people. But I think their real goal was to get me suspended / attacked- which they did. Whcih is what I am here to document on GitHub

The person addressing me as a "loony" with reply after reply is anti-Wiki - they circle all around my very concern of how people won't use Wiki style citation / author named sources. They don't witness Reddit, they don't document Reddit, they do not see that I am discussing mass man of Reddit's prizing of hate and the avoidance of prizing of sharing Wiki style in colberative goodness. Of course, Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan and James Joyce seemed to have all failed to get this point across to the person reply messaging me and humanity in total. Like it or non, RFK Jr has made autism a target. Attacking people with autism has been an organized CDC / White House behavior in year 2025. Trying to end war and hate - the opposite of organized White House 2025. The posting topic was about the White House organized media. Alas, what this Reddit user desires (if they are sincere) seems to be what many sports fans desire. To talk to other sports fans while watching wealthy people with an amy of USA medical doctors while some person outside the stadium / outside the living room HDTV screen - has no health care at all. But that sports star sure got the medical system to entertain an audience. And Trump is the entertainment star while people with less charming media talent go without health care. The system of fandom to Trump itself is dehumanizing, "loony". OPERA_A The Lunatics are We The People society wide. Out-group hate abounds. Russia won the information war.

History is a nightmware - James Joyce perspective. I view the situation as grim. Love one another, love thy enemy, fix the war and fix the hate issues in the world is being abandoned. Malala is family planning now, her youthful desire for world peace and preventing World War Three (John Stewart 2013 extended interview) much more tempered now. Maybe Malala thinks Palestine terror attack on October 7, 2023 is "Allah's will". I think it is education *about Allah and Torah* that is the very source of the problem. I think people being educated that there is an afterlife Heaven / Eden waiting for them after war and terrorism is the very source of war. I don't think year 2023 Malala is willing to criticize people for not taking MLK Jr an her book evenmore seriously in the 10 years between October 8, 2013 and October 7, 2023.  That's my cross to bear,it seems. I don't think people in USA even understood the reason thinking they have abandoned with Trump and Putin use of Surkov thinking / Fox News Murdoch thinking / Elon Musk Twitter thinking. Not that I expect anyone to make sense of my messages. But I just don't like organized war and organized hate. CSNY: Almost Cut My Hair.

The human species needs to rescue the human species from hate, war, terrorism. The weapon systems technology of killing other people from a distance, in large quanities,keeps advancing. Terrorism held back by technology proliferation.

My own message. Now that I know Reddit is preventing me from even being able to access messages I created after suspending... may as well capture it now. Antisemitism - Young Earth criticism. The conflict of science fiction from science nonfiction. Mr.Rachel is indoctrinating children into langauge where they can learn science. The Torah clergy is indoctriaating people into an idea that Earth is temporary and Eden is the perfect place. The claim of the Torah as nonfiction to adults who organize war against Quran adults who claim it too is nonfiction. A holy war to me is a fiction vs. fiction indoctrianation war. Killing people over one and only one storybook / waging war over one and only one storybook. In a way, that's what Trump is doing with media systems. Attacking competing media stories with power. Media venue vs. media venue. Indoctraination branding vs. competing indoctrination.

Fox News since year 1996 people give tree after tree of reports of family and friend issues, but will not address sustained forrest-level attention on the problem. Media ecology. Information warfare.

So do Russian soldiers. Hate and war are a global problem. Not just USA. Malala (as a leader) has been largely ingored by social media society since year 2012 and year 2013 - in favor of fixating on leader Putin and Trump / Kremlin and White House leaders. Martin Luther King Jr was not a government leader, and nor was Malala. People keep fixating on people who seek out power of war (Trump and Putin) and not We The People's hate issues inward in the human brain, inside the human mind. Malala was addressing "Radio Mullah" just like Fox News HDTV media issues. Yet, social media doesn't want to face the attraction to Fox News media, the attraction to Radio Mullah media. The prizing of dehumanization prizing of war, prizing of weapon systems and hate.

"That's the prevailing attitude in our culture. No matter what you do, just do it with a bit of finesse. You know, a sort of attitude of the survival of the slickest. Not the Darwinian survival of the fittest, but the survival of the slickest — whoever can be the slickest is the one who right. It's all right to lie, but lie with dignity. ... It's all right to steal and to rob and extort, but do it with a bit of finesse. It's even all right to hate, but just dress your hate up in the garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating. Just get by! That's the thing that's right according to this new ethic. My friends, that attitude is destroying the soul of our culture! It's destroying our nation!

Alas, this type of Surkov information bewilderment has been in front of Reddit audiences since March 2013 and it is considered thrilling entertainment. People can't imagine information warfare / mass man manipulation. September 1977 education https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus was abandoned on how group think / mass man / Reddit hive mind is manipulated and conditioned by Mike Johnson's military information statements / Putin's Kremlin information statements. People far prefer to make disposable low-effort commenting messages on social sites like Reddit than actually educate Marshall McLuhan and put a stop to the high speed electric light-speed media feedback loops.

At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

And people on Reddit are convinced there is no possible satruation of sarcasm / irony / satire / surreal / comedy / joke washing. Twitter accounts in November 2025 are revealed to have origins outside USA... yet Reddit things more no-identity sarcasm should be cheered on. Trump leads Reddit society with sarcasm, mocking. And this posting is about women being abused in "Epstein List" / "Harvey List" / Me too women... and Reddit is satire-washing it / entertainment-washing the male domination of Trump and Putin over their lvies. Anything for actors, Trump the actor, on Reddit. Reddit audience eats the shit and grins for more Trump mocking, President Tonly Clifton antics / White House Surkov students. RFK Jr running the CDC isn't obvious enough we have a name-fame symbolism issue for Reddit society to even TEMPORARILY (6 months sustained) halt mocking and entertainment to address things seriously. Reddit platform, Reddit end-users, Reddit audience, Reddit society satire-washes Trump and Putin as entertainment constantly. Reddit culture does as Texan Rick Roderick described in year 2013 as a threat to humanity: ... ... ...     
"this is sort of one of my own if you will forgive me – is what I’ll call banalization. And it’s always a danger when you do lectures like the ones I am doing now, and that’s to take these fundamentally important things like what does my life mean, and surely there must be a better way to organise the world than the way it is organised now, surely my life could have more meaning in a different situation. Maybe my life’s meaning might be to change it or whatever, but to take any one of these criticisms and treat them as banalities. This is the great – to me – ideological function of television and the movies. However extreme the situation, TV can find a way to turn it into a banality." - Duke University. https://rickroderick.org/304-marcuse-and-one-dimensional-man-1993/

Or people can say "whoosh" and it justifies the most horrific health care, most horrific dehumanization because entertainment and amusement as the expense of human beings is the Russian-induced minsets since year 2013. Mockery defeats all resistance. If you have a mental breakdown because of the billionare media system bombardment of Putin / Musk / Trump Truth Social values / Mudoch billionare - you are "weak" and a target of bullying / punching-down. It's a food chain of feasting upon people who have empathy beaten out of them by Musk and Reddit / Bluesky mob mentality.

"Epsite List" is an information list. It isn't jailing any criminals, it's a list of information. The bar is pretty low and USA social media society requests. Housing prices, girls having educaiton and freedom to defend against predoatry males, medical care, hate agaist Canada, all kindsof issues - and people have made a *list* of information - without even knowing who is that list - the prioirty. In television fiction shows, that's called a "mystery box" for the fiction watchig audience. Why not call for reform of government so people stop prizing liars as leaders. Deception leadership, Bullshit-based governing. Then address the crimals with transparency, facts, truth, evidence, hoeesty and not the most intertaining mock at how Donald Trump falls asleep in a meeting today. How about have hundreds of leaders who are honest and sincere and earnest.

You solve this by halting entertainment and studying Russian information warfare.

In other words: Billionare corportions, Corporate America, drills so much of your work life and consumerism in USA - that it is super extra devistating to die on certain times of the calendar. If your birth day or death day happens to fall upon the weeks around comsuerism purchase frenzy Christmas - the mass man / advertising on Reddit (funding Reddit) and advertising on television and corporate licensed music - makes that death ruin the entire rest of your life. 

The death of Jesus on the cross is a symbol of a *great death*. But coporate American has drilled into USA minds like it is april 15 death and taxes day. That people who die in machie train wrecks does not invoke fear of train machies and automobile machiens and truck machines - but dreading of having a car accident too close to Christmans consumerism day at Costco.

One could ponder if this is why Elon Musk Twitter and Facebook and Reddit and Corporate America are all lead by billionare Donald Trump Truth Social media now. Fox News consumerism nation.

Your death isn't emotionally devistating if it happens on non-consumerism holiday period. Like Bloomsday June 16, the day Donald Trump announced he will win Peresident and rule the world in year 2015. The death of life on Earth by Corporate America and competitive chian reacitons of competing for which selling marketing advertising consumer day is the important ones to die and not die on. The approved caleandar that kittens, puppies, friends, family should not die by being run over by a train or a truck on the corporate America machine trucks delivering consumer goods in Texas. Elon Musk is HQ in Texas now.... right-hand Corporate Ameirca to the Godfather of advertising and marketing "going virual on social media" Christmas consumerism holiday leadership.

Jesus died around the holidays - or born or rebortn or.... I celebrate that symbolic death calendar. And I remember all the people who died on any day of the year. Equality isn't just a topic of skin color equality, gender equality, economic equality. Oh wait, economic inequality: consumerism Corporate America holidays / time off work death days are more important. People will booze it up home from college and drunk driving their machine technology, booze fest NYE drunk driving in machines. OPERA_A don't die on some boring Tuesday that isn't around a holiday. It won't have the emotional impact of a holiday tragic death. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI

Every year or so, I mention this on social media: Why are rail drones not being created and sent 1 mile ahead of the main train to detect with cameras and trigger crossing signals?

Though the **Christian view of the world has paled** for many people, the symbolic treasure-rooms of the East are still full of marvels that can nourish for a long time to come the passion for show and new clothes.

Important skepticism. Multiple real-name real-face (video image) people need to step forward. A Wiki style refined, edit-history organized approach. Like Dr. Bandy X Leen has worked with multiple books, multiple people.

Commentary about the posting itself, not just this comment linked: The Title of the Reddit posting that made the front page. Avoidance of fact, avoidance of serious information on important topics. By naming it "this dementia patient" on REDDIT, in favor of the line used in the video dialog, instead of adding (longer length allowed on Reddit titles): "President Donald Trump health criticism technical:" prefix. The mockery / entertainment / amusement headline clickbait of title-less "me_irl" "this" postings on Reddit society. The systemic banality-washing of important and critical serious topics on Reddit around Trrump. Trump frames as meme / entertainment / amusement source for Reddit audience title presentation.
