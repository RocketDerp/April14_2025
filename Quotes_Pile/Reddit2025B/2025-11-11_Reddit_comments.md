Finnegans Wake. It is as if nobody on Reddit has heard of "The Tower of Babel". I suppose I can understand that some have never heard of 1924 onward publication of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, but it is the most relevant book to media ecology and Donald Trump! And Trump has been the center of USA attention for over a decade. Since June 16, 2015 nonstop media messaging systems about Trump! Donald Trump's power is his uniqueness, but the audience of Reddit never gets it. People are mesmerized, compulsive, in their attraction to mocking and hate around Trump. Trump sucks all the air out of the room, all attention to his mannerisms / style / fashion / libido / mojo / striking appearance. It isn't fleeting,people have devoted thousands of hours to mocking and insulting him over and over in feedback loops. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS, that is his talent and gift, HE FEELS the emotional and mental bloodbath creates in the room. He is a hate magnet, a mocking magnet. So much of people's lives have now been associated with this one man... that his presence activates so much of the human brain and nervous system. Only through Marshall McLuhan's poetic description of how human bodies behave to media system do you start to recognize the compulsive behavior of people around you. Trump is the ultimate icon and star of electric media, and people do not see that people are compulsively attracted to hate and mass dehumanization. It is like hundreds of times more powerful than the pull of sexy car machines, the feeling people get with exotic and complex gun machines and bullets. Trump can SEE how people behave about him on media and he can see the quantity of messages about him where others do not see the forest for the trees.

Reddit audience is the most arrogant in declaring only MAGA is a cult and can not see their own addiction to insulting and mocking Trump.

Social media did not stand up against entertainment. Against the puns / jokes / amusement / entertainment around Trump. Reddit community when given (fed by Kremlin and White House) absurd and surreal, adds MORE surreal every time. A predictable favoring of surreal absurd itself. Addictions running audience on Reddit and Bluesky. ... ... ...      
“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.

If Trump is so dumb, why can nobody on Reddit turn to Neil Postman's 1985 book and how it describes Donald Trump as President? I have personally met a dozen *more dumb* people in just the past week! These words "dumb", "stupid", are not describing the Fox News audience, low-effort commenting Reddit audience, all the topics of Marshall McLuhan's teaching! The MEDIUM is the dumbing down, a mob mentality of dumb induced by fiction media attraction, as [Carl Sagan wrote in his book in year 1995 (a decade after Postman's book)](/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md). ... ... ...       
"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” [Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody)." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**

I have witnessed many times on Reddit over the decades... people *complaining* that there is not enough advertising and marketing in USA. I used to watch Roger Ebert every week on TV in the 1980's and 1990's to get an idea of interesting films, and I asked people, world of mouth, and researched films before I went. Active seeking. Not letting a marketing trailers. It's like purchasing a video game pre-release based on marketing trailers. It's nonsense! People have no concept that REDDIT ITSELF, authentic users / word of mouth (not fake bots / accounts paid to promote) anymore. And it shows. People trend-chase popularity.

When Luigi murders someone with sneak-attack and gun worship December 4, 2024 everyone says health care is important - but then huge amounts of spare time / free time goes into far less important topics.

I do not agree. If there is design, it is Rupert Murdoch fiction storytelling and Putin IRA fiction storytelling. I think it's self-harm. I think expectations of 25% growth every year for corporations and stock market is unrealistic and we have been eating and wrecking our seedcorn, children's future. Climate change, housing, marriages (housing). I think Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is correct. This isn't design since 1985, it's an addiction behavior to sports / entertainment. And people won't stand up for goodness because mocking and insulting Trump is entertainment. Goodness is boring, nonfiction is boring to people.

When I start quoting books (to the A.I. training / future Google search engine hits) on Google, the egomania rage Reddit users get. People seem unable to see the forest for the trees when it comes to disposable cementing context. And being concerned about hate at the forest level, thinking attacking one tree is an accomplishment when humanity prizes hate and prizes war as some kind of war hero "winning" of leaders. War and butchering as a religion tradition / racial tradition / national tradition is treated a sacred by some people. Joyce's History is a Nightmare.

Surkovian information warfare methods. Surkovian governing. These patterns blow the minds of social media consumers. People can't name "Surkov".

https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1oxjl4o/i_think_i_saw_ted_cruz_at_the_puerto_vallarta/noy9o4w/

Reddit audience endlessly spends time around images of the wealthy and powerful saying they aree bad, but won't criticize society. Too preachy, too moral. Mocks children all the time, children like Malala for pointing out that children don't have voices in society. The voices in society are on Reddit mocking and insulting goodness / avoiding goodness / anything but asserting goodness. The asserting goodness is gun worship of Luigi all year 2025, murder thrills, USA gun worship. The freedom to be hate-filled monsters as leaders (like Ted Cruz and his wife), the freedom to be Reddit machine lovers. The fundamental attraction to badness. Not to measure our known problem of electing and upvoting such leaders on Reddit and as politicians. Not to understand why society flocks to such messengers/representatives... but as entertainment and amusement sources. Nothing can overcome this attraction force.  "Ted Cruz first became a significant source of widespread cliche mocking and internet memes around the time he gained national political prominence, with a notable peak during his 2016 presidential campaign."

Highly upvoted (popular Reddit) comment, tiny-short, out-group thrills to see Americans self-harm. Russia won, Surkov won, since March 2013. People endlessly prizing the anti-progress Putin outcomes. Not to say Russia is "winning", Putin has prized the same badness in domestic Russia. Goodness itself abandoned. Nonfiction learning, comprehension, understanding abandoned.  The language of hate prizing and mindsets of self-harm as long as others prize hate in mob mentality...abounds.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1oxf9xm/trump_withdraws_support_for_marjorie_taylor_greene/nox6nhs/

This is the social power of the biggest star of media in all history. This is the messages everyone wanted to share, the mindsets that have gotten all the exercise. Worship of high speed message delivery about this content. Mocking Tony Clifton actors, mocking antics politics, is not resisting antics politics. Surkov understood this 25 years ago and was able to addict a nation to this via IRA and CA since year 2013. Neil Postman was correct about these exploitable technology outcomes in 1985, 1992... Rick Roderick was correct in 1993. People are going to look at the real world, reality outside the high-speed media systems, and possibly become very violent over not understanding and grasping how sports mentality of out-group mocking and messaging / informing junk created a mess. Maybe some sincere, honest, goodness oriented people will rise to lead the whole world away from here... but the rest of the world has been given a 'rich king' nation to blame for everything. Trump bragging, our super-hero save the world media entertainment - has drowned out Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's reforms. And people werenot intertested in passing down what MLK Jr had to say about hate and poverty of the spirit.

Reddit audience convinces itself it is physical disorder. That all of MAGA / Fox News Audience is "sundowning". That way the addictions to fiction content aren't addressed. Trump being "insane" is being unusual / distinctive. That's what draws the Reddit audience on ANY topic. A kitten with distinctive body pose or fur color... front page of Reddit. A sports clip with distinctive movements, front page of Reddit. Donald Trump and his skin color gets constant attention. Distinctive, eye catching, behavior that stands out. Outstanding Trump. People are not attracted to promoting the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944, that's distinctive better - but people are attracted to mocking / insulting / badness that Trump provides. Mocking a Tony Clifton performance is not resisting a Tony Clifton performance. Trump grasps SNL.

That's why people on Reddit are attracted to Trump. The constant Tony Clifton juxtaposition / paradox / inverted symbolism. This has gone on for OVER TEN YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS. Trump is not a coward and weak about waving around badness symbolism. This flag is a technical glitch, I doubt it was planned or organized, but people WANT him to be a bad-ass so they can mock and insult him. But Trump and Putin know this power of attracting hate / power of concentrating hate.

Nonfiction education, understanding the world, teaching children to be better than previous generations (progress itself). Instead, we let predatory billionaires run all our media systems like Radio Mullah in Swat Valley, Pakistan and Mecca run by wealth lords. We are dominating people with badness, trickle down content / trickle down advertising and marketing for badness.

The world over, age 18 men are put into military to kill. Consentual sex between adults, especially in the age of birth control, is not one of the worst forbidden sins of society. 21 year old sex workers. Preach about the underlying economic / religion / systemic conditions. Even then, people do it for entertainment and experience. There is a whole "MILF" movement in society. Many young men would say they want sex with older women (not to have children, birth control casual sex). And I'm not saying these idaes are simple. The SIMPLE ideas are the soldiers / war / hate being bad. Consentual adults. You run into all kinds of issues of hollywood actor trafficing, musicians, at age 15... there are no easy answers. But soldiers and war, we can't seem to agree on. Killing / murdering is bad, but we elect politicians that build nuclear bombs and we can't get mental helath professionals to decide that all of Russia needs a mental helath intervention / preaching since February 2014. Morality wise, we are on the verge of machine sex toys - women should speak up on this. If men claim they can't control themselves or need recreational sex. Do we protect human sex workers against robot intrusion, or does robots like video games - satisfy some of the adult consent problems? These issues can take years of debate, are there women out ther leading it?

When Trump mocks for OVER TEN YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS, Reddit audience mobkcs back. When Putin conditionons the audience to *hate harder*, people hate harder. No rescue of MAGA, not rescue of ICE. Internet Research Agency, Surkov, Russia won. Hearts and souls who shit upon Atlanta's MLK Jr.

Mocking of compassion. Parents have made Donald Trump a role model for children since June 16, 2015. Reddit users hide their real name, wear a mask, hide their real city, self-dehumanize and welcome Putin's meme army since year 2013... and don't see they too need rescued from the simulcra patterns.

"Ah, I think that one of the greatest examples of this – for me – is the discourse concerning body weight in women; bulimia, anorexia and so on. It’s as though a male dominant society was able in the Middle Ages to, you know, put a chastity belt on a woman, to put, you know, to… keep food away from her and starve her if she misbehaved. But today we accomplish the same feat through images that are constantly bombarded into the conscious and into the unconscious of women, and they perform the wonderfully humanistic task of starving themselves to death while male therapists teach them how to get on twelve step programs to eat. See, for Foucault, this is why its not humanism.

This kind of malady is a cultural malady that strikes at the very heart of life. Once something like eating is death then you have struck at the very heart of life. The enemy of the older radical theories may have been the ruling class, but today the stakes of whether we will reform ourselves into a new kind of human being, a new kind of society, whether we will find selves worth being… the stakes of it are simply life itself. And that makes it quite dramatic actually."  - Rick Roderick https://rickroderick.org/306-foucault-and-the-disappearance-of-the-human-1993/

Answer: becaue it works. This is what society responds to. This is what wealthy asset lords / land lords in New York City do behind closed doors. This is marking / bradking / putting scent on things. It sitll blows Reddit audience mind that this is what Putin / Surkov / Trump found to work. People don't believe in mistakes and forgiveness, yet can't face the reality that *this works* is staring them in the face! NFL football brain damage was *prized* by men and women both! Boxing brain damage. Really look at what entertainment goes on in casinos that Trump studied. Trump wasn't about making money off casinos, he was about the glitz and emotions of casino entertainment. Andy Kaulfman's act Tony Clifton was ahead of time, Trump playing TOny Clifgon works!

December 20, 2013 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/- and the Middle East role-model of clergy / spirtiual leadership is terrorism and extreme wealth bombing.

When I lived in Fort Wayne, Indiana I worked for a Petnagon military contractor at age 16, worked for a stainless steel factory, my dad ran a Pepsi canning factory, I worked for a plastics factory... the computer industry was heavy male dominated on the technical side... and I have seen many ways men promote hate-filled dehumanization of other men and women. As if it is a competittion. And clearly Donald Trump shows that this is a huge problem, not just my own experience. OPERA_A Check It Out!

The biggest frustration is the media addiction driving every aspect of society. The abandonment of goodness, the abadnonment of nonfiction progress. This was obvious during the pandemic. People think it is entertainment to convince other people that fiction is reality. We all live under this every day now. It isn't just about Donald Trump being elected, it is patterns of thinking that drive the whole nation into self-harm across many areas.

This is a serious problem, people can not recognize group thinking, mob mentality and only process the GOP / MAGA power of hundreds of millions of people in terms of senile / dementia. Further, by claiming Trump is senile it is saying he is not mentally responsible for his choices.

Competeition. People are raised to view that being competitive is what is most important. Entire religion faiths built on out-group hate. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      
BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.
CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about.

Social media society is constantly amused and entertained mocking back at Trump. Trump does Tony Clifton antics on Truth Social / Twitter - and social media audiences mock back how dumb, stupid, idiot, moron, demential, senile Trump is. It has been gong on FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS, endless mockery / mocking back and forth at Trump media content. That is the power Trump has, tickle and simulate the hive mind of society, the meme hive mind of social media notification society.

Joke-washing the widespread manipulation of women. Anti-Malala jokes of society. Instead of people being serious and quoting and linking and repeating Malala since year 2012 / year 2013 when she became world famous, people just joke on and on avout sex with young girls and the conflicts over maturity / consent / education. And people rarely seem to criticize Hollywood TV / films / music videos / music stars who traffic in sexualy appealing / attractive sexuality of voices / body / dress / dialog. Let Malala give voices to young girls and stop acting like girls over the age of 9 don't need to be self-aware of the exploitation in multiple geogrpahic locations over thousands of years that women have experienced.

Loving people too much vs. not caring about wealth lords like Putin and Pakistan Taliban who starve people and take away their freedom. Birth control has fundamentaly changed recreational sex. The idea that you have to hate your ex-lover is toxic. Falling in love wtih more than one person practically nobody defends. Think about that: this world needs more hate? More war? People can not race reality and truth about love and peace actually being good. People like Putin and Donald Trump punish those they don't consider "loyal" to harm people in Ukraine. What good is a marriage without forgiveness? Understanding, growth, change? If cheating is your concern, it has to be part of the dialog and reality of the marriage. Humanity has so many lvoe songs, perfumes, clothing fashion style, adveritisng "sex sells", marketing "sex sells", public relations "sex sells" / "epstein list", photographs / art images / **stimulation**. Adult, consentual we can't even sort out. We can't even all get on the same page since year 2012 and year 2013 and keep focused on Malala's reform of girls against the Taliban and Palestine terrorism... giving young girls a voice and understanding of our world from adult predatory power structures (and advents like birth control not in Mohammad's Quran from year 635). Celebrity pople ike this sports star marriage you FIND OUT about infidelity and cheating in the marriage because so many people are staring at the sex icon sports star with the army of medical doctors (sports medicine industry complex). There sure smells to be some key to world peace in our egoism over being HONEST about cheating in marriages - including weekly discussions within the marriage (on topic of cheating) or weekly recrational sex or both! Marriages left to non-dialog (dialog intercourse). And some couples have no sex drive at all, do not cheat, because they don't even care about sex. My opening sentences repeated: *too much love*, falling in love with too many people. Audiences don't even DISCUSS that is what they are against. https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/dave-grohl-reportedly-accused-wife-020002158.html I'm against deception and manipulation and lies in marriage just as I am in business, government, art. I think the LIES and anti-forgiveness is what is most toxic. Not the lies about weding vows, but the lies we tell ourselves that February 2014 onward Ukraine war doesn't imapct marriage / sex / children / future / parenting. You can not PREDICT your year 2012 marriage in Ukraine will end up being Hell. You can not predict your March 2023 marriage in Palesitne will become Hell! I'm agaist war and hate. Falling in love with too many people is a very tricky problem that is more about Tower of Babel communications of society than hate. It is hate and war and economic starving out of people that is a common PUBLIC concern. Private affairs / choice marriage honesty - is entertainment to people. Sports stars, rock music stars, and their sex lives. Trump and his super star sex life. Musk and his super star sex life. Putin and his secret children and lovers.

Feeding bullshit information into our brains all the time is the cause of brainrot. Feeding fiction all the time and avoiding nonficiton is the cause of brainrot. Garbage into the brain is the cause of brainrot! It's called learning, and learning everything there is about Donald Trump's diapers on Reddit every hour of every day is brainrot. Learning about love, compassion, forgiveness, translation of past to current on media, learning of different cultures and translations, learning of problems in Swat Valley Pakistan since January 2009 blogger Malala - is actual learning of the real world. Learning fiction about science fiction agenls and Star Wars Force Ghosts and every single detail of a fiction story and not being CLEAR what is fiction (Rupert Murdoch media empire, Fox News, Newsmax, Reddit, Bluesky, Musk Twitter, Alex Jones, on and on) confuses our brains into brainrot addictions. Advertising systems, marketing systems, manipulation systems, public relations systems.

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

yes. every day. On Bluesky and Reddit and other media: consantly cheering on how dumb / stupid / idiot / moron / dementia / senile Donald Trump is. Cheering on the total mockery. The never-ending mocking, insulting. The President Tony Clifton performance with Surkov student screenplays. Audiences glued to the /r/All front page topics of mocking MAGA and mocking Trump White House. Cheering on South Park 2025 in how thrilling it is to be bamboozled and how smart Reddit is compared to Presidnet Tony Clifton dumb.

Trump's power os media, antics on TV, going golfing and having it filmed, Truth Social media, Twitter, on front page of Reddit constantly and always. Fox News. Go down with the ship, but send a S.O.S. to the world that media addiction to trash content (Fox News) is self-harm. Community on Bluesky and Reddit social media can't imagine halting entertainment. [ACTION PLAN: Be serious, halt all sports and games entertainment, halt mocking. Teach nonfiction. Use the spare time and free time that goes into constantly mocking Trump and Putin and actually stand up for getting on the same pages (of goodness).](/Grim_Blunt/Stop_All_Entertainment.md)

No author names, no links, no book titles, no quotes. Three paragraphs of original claims and no identity. Caliming that "Russia isn't the problem" that created Trump.

The life of a true king who does not follow society conventions. In Paris, a wealthy man would be considered a social failure if he didn't have a mistress for much of "Western civialization" time period. None of these issues raised in the social media image and Reddit posting have to do with governing USA. Except of course, "choice marriage honesty". Do you see social media users declaring that maybe freedom of Church means freedom to have children with mulitple partners? Or is that only what rich people do in Ottman empire or Salt Lake City Utah? People are so concerned with White House male sex lives, Epstein list, and not really addressing media honesty. Even though "media honesty" is part of the topic, omission, the sex topics and power to have mutliple partners is really what draws November 2025 USA audiences. Private jets, sex lives of leaders, it impresses people that star power lets you grab women by the pussy and be "respected" for conquest.

It is the thrill of hate upon the White House that drives Bluesky and Reddit society. The simulation of messaging and communicating with family. Instead of addressing addiction to terrible leaders, deception leadership, people are excited to encounter mocking messages and hate messages. Trump leaders in hate and mocking, USA society eats it up.

Images consumed on Reddit. That's the values. Having yourself on front page of Reddit constantly with an audience eating out of your hand. Mocking Tony Clifton acts and fashion is not resisting Clifton performances. Fox News experience of programming audiences to mock.

Tiny-short reactionary Reddit audience message. Simple-think. All Bluesky and Reddit care about in year 2025 focus on is who is upseeting how, cheering "Leopards Faces" when MAGA Americans and Trump (American) self-harm the USA. Entirely ignorant of Russian Internet Research Agency since year 2013, Americans cheering on the harm of other Americans in conditioned patterns.

Americas, all of them, are happy as long as the out-group Americans are harmed. Leopards Eating Faces 2025 cheering all year long on Reddit front page. The common values of USA is to hate human persons and cheer on damaging systems of harm. Be it Fox News harming humanity, be it Putin's Kremlin harming humanity, any system that harms humanism is cheered on as a "win".
