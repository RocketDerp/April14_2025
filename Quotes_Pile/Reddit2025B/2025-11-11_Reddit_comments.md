Finnegans Wake. It is as if nobody on Reddit has heard of "The Tower of Babel". I suppose I can understand that some have never heard of 1924 onward publication of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, but it is the most relevant book to media ecology and Donald Trump! And Trump has been the center of USA attention for over a deacde. Since June 16, 2015 nonstop media messaging systems about Trump! Donald Trump's power is his uniqueness, but the audience of Reddit never gets it. People are memsmerized, compuslive, in thier attraction to mocking and hate around Trump. Trump sucks all the air out of the room, allatteniton to his mannerisms / style / fashion / libedo / mojo / striking apperance. It isn't fleeting,people have devoted thousands of hours to mocking and insulting him over and over in feedback loops. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS, that is his talent and gift, HE FEELS the emotional and mental bloodbathh creates in the room. He is a hate magnet, a mocking magnet. So much of people's lives have now been associated with this one man... that his presence activates so much of the human brain and nervious system. Only through Marshall McLunan's poetic description of how human bodies behave to media system do you start to recognize the compulsive behavior of people around you. Trump is the ultimate icon and star of electric media, and people do not see that people are compusively attrawcted to hate and mass dehumanization. It is like hundreds of times more powerful than the pull of sexy car machines, the feeling people get with exotic and complex gun machines and bullets. Trump can SEE how people behave about him on media and he can see the quantitiy of messages about him where others do not see the forest for the trees.

Social media did not stand up against entertainment. Against the puns / jokes / amusement / entertainment around Trump.

“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.

If Trump is so dumb, why can nobody on Reddit turn to Neil Postmn's 1985 book and how it describes Donald Trump as President? I have personally met a dozen *more dumb* people in just the past week! These words "dumb", "stupid", are not describing the Fox News audience, low-effort commeeting Reddit audience, all the topics of Marshall McLuhan's teching! The MEDIUM is the dumbing down, a mob mentality of dumb induced by fiction media attraction, as [Carl Sagan wrote in his book in year 1995 (a decade after Postman's book)](/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md). ... ... ...       
"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” [Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody)." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**

I have witnessed many times on Reddit over the decades... people *complaining* that there is not enough advertising and marketing in USA. I used to watch Roger Ebert every week on TV in the 1980's and 1990's to get an idea of interesting films, and I asked people, world of mouth, and researched films before I went. Active seeking. Not letting a marketing trailers. It's like purchasing a video game pre-release based on marketing trailers. It's nonsense!

I do not agree. If there is design, it is Rupert Murdoch fiction storytelling and Putin IRA fiction storytelling. I think it's self-harm. I think expectations of 25% growth every year for corporations and stock market is unrealistic and we have been eating and wrecking our seedcorn, children's future. Climate change, housing, marriages (housing). I think Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is correct. This isn't design since 1985, it's an addiction behavior to sports / entertainment. And people won't stand up for goodness because mocking and insulting Trump is entertainment. Goodness is boring, nonfiction is boring to people.

When I start quoting books (to the A.I. training / future Google search engine hits) on Google, the egomania rage Reddit users get. People seem unable to see the forest for the trees when it comes to disposable comenting context. And being concerned about hate at the forest level, thinking attacking one tree is an accomplishment when humanity prizes hate and prizes war as some kind of war hero "winning" of leaders. War and butchering as a religion tradition / racial tradition / national tradition is treated a sacred by some people. Joyce's History is a Nightmare.

https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1oxjl4o/i_think_i_saw_ted_cruz_at_the_puerto_vallarta/noy9o4w/

Reddit audience endlessly spends time around images of the wealthy and powerful saying they aree bad, but won't criticize society. Too preachy, too moral. Mocks children all the time, children like Malala for pointing out that children don't have voices in society. The voices in society are on Reddit mocking and insulting goodness / avoiding goodness / anything but asserting goodness. The asserting goodness is gun worship of Luigi all year 2025, murder thrills, USA gun worship. The freedom to be hate-filled monsters as leaders (like Ted Cruz and his wife), the freedom to be Reddit machinel lovers. The fundamental attraction to badness. Not to measure our known problemof electing and upvoting such leaders on Reddit and as politicians. Not tounderstand why society flocks to such messengers/representatives... but as entertainment and amusement sources. Nothing can overcome this attraction force.  "Ted Cruz first became a significant source of widespread cliche mocking and internet memes around the time he gained national political prominence, with a notable peak during his 2016 presidential campaign."

Highly upvoted (popular Reddit) comment, tiny-short, out-group thrills to see Americans self-harm. Russia won, Surkov won, since March 2013. People endlessly prizing the anti-progress Putin outcomes. Not to say Russia is "winning", Putin has prized the same badnessin domestic Russia. Goodness itself abandoned. Nonfiction learning, comprehesion, understanding abandoned.  The language of hate prizing and mindsets of self-harm as long as others prize hate in mob mentality...abounds.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1oxf9xm/trump_withdraws_support_for_marjorie_taylor_greene/nox6nhs/

This is the social power of the biggest star of media in all history. This is the messages eveyone wanted to share, the mindsets that have gotten all the exercise. Worship of high speed message delivery about this content. Mocking Tony Clifton actors, mocking antics politics, is not resisting antics politics. Surkov understood this 25 years ago and was able to addict a nation to this via IRA and CA since year 2013. Neil Postman was correct about these exploitable technology outcomes in 1985, 1992... Rick Roderick was correct in 1993. People are going to look at the real world, reality outside the high-speed media systems, and possibly become very violent over not understanding and grasping how sports mentality of out-group mocking and messaging / informing junk created a mess. Maybe some sincere, honest, goodness oriented people will rise to lead the whole world away from here... but the rest of the world has been given a 'rich king' nation to blame for everything. Trump bragging, our super-hero save the world media entertainment - has drowned out Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's reforms. And people werenot intertested in passing down what MLK Jr had to say about hate and poverty of the spirit.

Reddit audience convinces itself it is physical disorder. That all of MAGA / Fox News Audience is "sundowning". That way the addictions to fiction content aren't addressed. Trump being "insane" is being unusual / distinctive. That's what draws the Reddit audience on ANY topic. A kiten with distinctive body pose or fur color... front page of Reddit. A sports clip with distinctive movements, front page of Reddit. Donald Trump and his skin color gets constant attention. Disctinctive, eye catching, behavior that stands out. Outstanding Trump. People are not attracted to promoting the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944, that'd dictictive better - but people are attracted to mocking / insutling / badness that Trump provides. Mocking a Tony Clifton performance is not resisting a Tony Clifton performance. Trump grasps SNL.

The world over, age 18 men are put into military to kill. Consentual sex between adults, especially in the age of birth control, is not one of the worst forbidden sins of society. 21 year old sex workers. Preach about the underlying economic / religion / systemic conditions. Even then, people do it for entertainment and experience. There is a whole "MILF" movement in society. Many young men would say they want sex with older women (not to have children, birth control casual sex). And I'm not saying these idaes are simple. The SIMPLE ideas are the soldiers / war / hate being bad. Consentual adults. You run into all kinds of issues of hollywood actor trafficing, musicians, at age 15... there are no easy answers. But soldiers and war, we can't seem to agree on. Killing / murdering is bad, but we elect politicians that build nuclear bombs and we can't get mental helath professionals to decide that all of Russia needs a mental helath intervention / preaching since February 2014. Morality wise, we are on the verge of machine sex toys - women should speak up on this. If men claim they can't control themselves or need recreational sex. Do we protect human sex workers against robot intrusion, or does robots like video games - satisfy some of the adult consent problems? These issues can take years of debate, are there women out ther leading it?

When Trump mocks for OVER TEN YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS, Reddit audience mobkcs back. When Putin conditionons the audience to *hate harder*, people hate harder. No rescue of MAGA, not rescue of ICE. Internet Research Agency, Surkov, Russia won. Hearts and souls who shit upon Atlanta's MLK Jr.

Mocking of compassion. Parents have made Donald Trump a role model for children since June 16, 2015. Reddit users hide their real name, wear a mask, hide their real city, self-dehumanize and welcome Putin's meme army since year 2013... and don't see they too need rescued from the simulcra patterns.

"Ah, I think that one of the greatest examples of this – for me – is the discourse concerning body weight in women; bulimia, anorexia and so on. It’s as though a male dominant society was able in the Middle Ages to, you know, put a chastity belt on a woman, to put, you know, to… keep food away from her and starve her if she misbehaved. But today we accomplish the same feat through images that are constantly bombarded into the conscious and into the unconscious of women, and they perform the wonderfully humanistic task of starving themselves to death while male therapists teach them how to get on twelve step programs to eat. See, for Foucault, this is why its not humanism.

This kind of malady is a cultural malady that strikes at the very heart of life. Once something like eating is death then you have struck at the very heart of life. The enemy of the older radical theories may have been the ruling class, but today the stakes of whether we will reform ourselves into a new kind of human being, a new kind of society, whether we will find selves worth being… the stakes of it are simply life itself. And that makes it quite dramatic actually."  - Rick Roderick https://rickroderick.org/306-foucault-and-the-disappearance-of-the-human-1993/

Answer: becaue it works. This is what society responds to. This is what wealthy asset lords / land lords in New York City do behind closed doors. This is marking / bradking / putting scent on things. It sitll blows Reddit audience mind that this is what Putin / Surkov / Trump found to work. People don't believe in mistakes and forgiveness, yet can't face the reality that *this works* is staring them in the face! NFL football brain damage was *prized* by men and women both! Boxing brain damage. Really look at what entertainment goes on in casinos that Trump studied. Trump wasn't about making money off casinos, he was about the glitz and emotions of casino entertainment. Andy Kaulfman's act Tony Clifton was ahead of time, Trump playing TOny Clifgon works!

Trump is a bullet-sponge / "LOL cow" people milk and people block MAGA and do not stand up to the hate-filled idea of war / soldiers / domination / conquest that Putin has rekindled in male community since year 2013. December 20, 2013 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/- and the Middle East role-model of clergy / spirtiual leadership is terrorism and extreme wealth bombing.

When I lived in Fort Wayne, Indiana I worked for a Petnagon military contractor at age 16, worked for a stainless steel factory, my dad ran a Pepsi canning factory, I worked for a plastics factory... the computer industry was heavy male dominated on the technical side... and I have seen many ways men promote hate-filled dehumanization of other men and women. As if it is a competittion. And clearly Donald Trump shows that this is a huge problem, not just my own experience. OPERA_A Check It Out!

Reddit audience constantly mocks "leopards ate my face" at Americans mind-fucked by Musk Twitter, Murdoch Fox News, Russian IRA, Cambridgw Analytica since year 2013. A society, social media society nationwide, that thinks LOL at suffering of Americans is great television and meme content.

People embraced out-group hate patterns fed by the IRA since year 2013. Other nations copycayt Russia's methods. USA society has not resisted or faced up tot he situation. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" describes our situation.
