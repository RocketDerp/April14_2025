I suppose I can understand that some have never heard of 1924 onward publication of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, but it is the most relevant book to media ecology and Donald Trump! And Trump has been the center of USA attention for over a deacde. Since June 16, 2015 nonstop media messaging systems about Trump! Donald Trump's power is his uniqueness, but the audience of Reddit never gets it. People are memsmerized, compuslive, in thier attraction to mocking and hate around Trump. Trump sucks all the air out of the room, allatteniton to his mannerisms / style / fashion / libedo / mojo / striking apperance. It isn't fleeting,people have devoted thousands of hours to mocking and insulting him over and over in feedback loops. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS, that is his talent and gift, HE FEELS the emotional and mental bloodbathh creates in the room. He is a hate magnet, a mocking magnet. So much of people's lives have now been associated with this one man... that his presence activates so much of the human brain and nervious system. Only through Marshall McLunan's poetic description of how human bodies behave to media system do you start to recognize the compulsive behavior of people around you. Trump is the ultimate icon and star of electric media, and people do not see that people are compusively attrawcted to hate and mass dehumanization. It is like hundreds of times more powerful than the pull of sexy car machines, the feeling people get with exotic and complex gun machines and bullets. Trump can SEE how people behave about him on media and he can see the quantitiy of messages about him where others do not see the forest for the trees.

The thrust to take over Greenland and Canada is due to some kind of scheme for rare Earth minerals, beyond just the whole map line addiction (expanding teritory) that rulers / kings have.

Lots of fun at Finnegans Wake.

Fiction poetry of Austin Powers film... you need to go into fiction poetry of Finnegans Wake to really capture the addiction mindsets people have to Trump language. People are anti-Woke, not self-aware at the Marshall McLuhan media ecology to the Fox News trance / Trump language trances. Reddit audience is the most arrogant in declaring only MAGA is a cult and can not see thier own addiciton to insutling and mocking Trump.

Social media did not stand up against entertainment. Against the puns / jokes / amusement / entertainment around Trump. Reddit commenity when given (fed by Kremlin and White House) absurd and sureal, adds MORE surreal every time. A predictible favoring of surreal absurd itself. Addicitons running audience on Reddit and Bluesky. ... ... ...      
“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

The BIG SAD, the Mass Man (Marshall McLuhan) SAD. Like an entire population BIG SAD. Surkov won, USA lost. NATO lost. ... ... ...      
“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 241

Describing the loss of reality. This is information warfare, people have no self-awareness that this is what has wrecked the USA. Defending **Reality** means nothing to Reddit commenting community. People who prize disposable commenting, abandoned comment creation, over Wikipedia / Wiki system organization of progressive imporovement to comprehension and understanding. There has been no effort to work together and get all people on the same page against The Russian "War Against Reality" described September 9, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

If Trump is so dumb, why can nobody on Reddit turn to Neil Postmn's 1985 book and how it describes Donald Trump as President? I have personally met a dozen *more dumb* people in just the past week! These words "dumb", "stupid", are not describing the Fox News audience, low-effort commeeting Reddit audience, all the topics of Marshall McLuhan's teching! The MEDIUM is the dumbing down, a mob mentality of dumb induced by fiction media attraction, as [Carl Sagan wrote in his book in year 1995 (a decade after Postman's book)](/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md). ... ... ...       
"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” [Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody)." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**

To a "guns are *cool, man*" chucklehead, everything is a joke. Anti-reality of saying it is $200 worth of ammo makes people LOL into a meme stupor. Surkov information warfare, Donald Trump and others dong Tony Clifton performances, blows out mids into joke mindsets / detachment from real reality of life on Earth. We are LIVING INSIDE Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death with high speed meedi systems, Reddit, Bluesky, TikTok".

I have witnessed many times on Reddit over the decades... people *complaining* that there is not enough advertising and marketing in USA. I used to watch Roger Ebert every week on TV in the 1980's and 1990's to get an idea of interesting films, and I asked people, world of mouth, and researched films before I went. Active seeking. Not letting a marketing trailers. It's like purchasing a video game pre-release based on marketing trailers. It's nonsense! People have no concept that REDDIT ITSELF, authentic users / word of mouth (not fake bots / accounts paid to promote) anymore. And it shows. Peeople trend-chase popularity.

There are examples of legendary long-term good films were flops at the cinema. There are so many choices of entertainment these days (people are so constantly entertained by Trump White House / Kremlin, video games, ARG).

Hate motivates, Trump spins hate patterns all over audiences. Tony Clifton shows do that.

More cravings for advertisements and marketing. People will go to the next Reddit posting how billionares run the world, then comment about how bad it is that there isn't enough billioanre money spent on advertising a film. People CRAVE billionare society without any self-awareness. When Luigi murders someone with sneak-attack and gun worship December 4, 2024 everyone says helath care is important - but then huge amounts of spare time / free time goes into far less important topics. People do not see they are wasting the power of the pepole. Trump knows how to get crowds to flock to topics, but We the People avoid nonfiction goodness on serious topics (health care). People will not turn to serious nonfiction books and just have smoking Luigi gun worship messages all year 2025. Reddit society eats out of the hands of Trump. Media addicts all. No assertion of goodness, call for sustained focus. ... ... ...
