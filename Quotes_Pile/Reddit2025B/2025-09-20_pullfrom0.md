Also a faith that there are two and only two sides to problems, even when answer 1 is wrong and even answer 2 is wrong and humanity needs to find new answers and solutions. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

This Reddit response message is why we need to be teaching Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" that focuses on the presentation technique, entertainment addiction of television / high speed media. Why we need to be teaching Joseph Campbell's Comparative Mythology (with a focus on James Joyce, with his wife Jean Erdman, two Joyce teachers) and Marshall McLuhan's work on comparing media environments. We are not facing up to our fiction addictions, anti-science. Compulsive attraction to dehumanize our own selves in attraction to fiction storytelling and content. Anti-science self-harm and mindsets of attacking the Earth itself / attacking other people, the egomania that comes from fiction religion media systems, Edward Bernays content, Russian information warfare (Surkovian). This is a problem of our point in history of favoring egoism over reality. We had these problems before Russia started the year 2013 War Against Reality, gross misunderstandings and comprehension failures. We are not grasping the depth of the situation of 8 billion people. ... ... ... “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Left and Right both agreeing to murder and kill each other, shooting guns, is a problem. I want to describe myself as anti-murder pro-education, like Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan who is against violence and terrorist acts and organizing improved reformed teaching and self-awareness of education / learning. What I see is Reddit messages implying that "left" means you think murdering someone over their media presentation / fiction content creation (Charlie Kirk's fiction storytelling) is acceptable. To me it is not, and we are normalizing that killing and hate are not the problem, that the concern is left vs. right. ToDo: Insert link to The 1954 Equation.

He didn't just magically learn about Charlie Kirk being there on that day in public. Information systems matter, views of reality matter from what people consume. You are in a group of people with the same media consumption, just like members of a church consuming the same terrorism messages of out-group hate from the Levant information systems. Media ecology learning and study is not optional! Again, he did not magically learn of Charlie Kirk, this was not a relationship of Kirk stealing a love interest, this was a podcaster / media personality creating content and a media consumer / audience member who murdered the media content creator. Study cases like the murder of John Lennon. His media fame and fiction storytelling (The Beatles, etc) impact on society.

We (society) can't face that The Bible has many of the same problems of the Quran and Torah. That people hallucinate they hear magical voices when reading science fiction storytelling. What I call the Bible verse "1 John 4:20" education problem / crisis. That people have *not seen God*, have not *seen Jesus*, have only read a book. This is a media ecology crisis that people can't grasp that other books besides 2,000 year old Bible can induce the same patterns of mass delusions and mass hallucination.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time. Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics. His aim is to undermine peoples' perceptions of the world, so they never know what is really happening. Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads" https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

"this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, **love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group**. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.  **Now, today (1987) there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there." - [Joseph Campbell, age 83, 1987.

Moscow Russia mocking the USA with a Wuhan China virus to USA face... but Reddit meme addicts can't face up to **factual hard evidence** validated by Johns Hoplins University and  George Washington University that shows that the *craving for debate* is so strog in USA, people will flock to RFK Jr and do everything possible to avoid making this August 24,m 2018 story front-page pinned on every major Reddit community / subreddit. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - even the super-meme hero Stephen Colbert seems to have suddently forgot his own Star Wars Day 2019 story when January 2020 ruled around, less than a year later, whcih Reddit community entirely can't recall either.

Again, why does this Stephen Colbert story from Star Wars Foce Day 2019 have only 
1,082,533 views today (September 20, 2025)? Why can't Reddit community get this to be the most-viewed video on all of Reddit once the COVID-19 pandemic came about to everyone's attention in January 2020? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju7Yt0LMiVk ANSWER: Because it is **NONFICTION**, and serious discussion of Putin information warfare directly on Reddit has been manipulated in the minds to AVOID NONFICTION. No matter how much I raise this topic on Blueksy and Reddit, people act like it is a "nothingburger". The addiciton to American on American hate is at such a high level, nobody can see that anti-science anti-reality anti-nonfiction has taken hold in USA. Russia won, Surkov won, the pro-Measels evidence goes bac, to 2014 according to Johns Hopkins University and George Washington University! And that's only a SINGLE media platform they got real data from, Twitter, what about the topic Reddit was manipualting?

Exactly what educated people think of the United States of America who can't engage nonfiction learning and is blocking people feom going to university and has no health care system to take care of friends and neighbors.

Note the lack of author citation, link to article, book title, etc. Just tiny short messages, millions and millions of tiny short messages. Using all free time and spare time to reaction-comment to Donald Trump instead of organizing education and teaching to address the Russian information warfare loss.

I am living in two major echo chambers in the USA: conservative echo chamber and the anti-conservative echo chamber. Being anti-conservative is not a free thinker any more than being an atheist is being a free thinking. Atheists can not translate Torah science ficiton vs. Bible science fiction vs. Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghost" science fiction vs. Hamlet Shakespeare 1623 "Ghost" science fiction.  They don't understand metaphors and what 1924 James Joyce publication of "Finnegans Wake" reveals. There is no sueprnatural, there is no magic. Atheists don't get it, being anti-Trump is not free thinking, it is compusive mocking to Tony Clifton acts. ... ... ... “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

No, they do not. Carl Jung made this point about Nazi Germany not realizing the fiction addiction / compusive mind behaivor. Nobody would *wish and desire* to live in this Hell we are in September 2025 USA. This is all detachment from reality in favor of fiction addictions to Truth Social and Fox News alternate realities. ... ... ...  “The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.” - [Dr. Carl Jung](../Doctors/Carl_Jung.md), After the Catastrophe, 1945 - bit simple-think short-length Twitter-like messages won't cite nonfiction learning on the subjects.

What Neil Postman described in 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", Reddit mockery-washing of Trump.

People raised on advertising and marketing from bith. Parented by Fox News and Reality TV. ... ... ... "Parents were eager to hope that television could **teach their children something other than which breakfast cereal has the most crackle**. At the same time, “Sesame Street” relieved them of the responsibility of teaching their pre-school children how to read—no small matter in a culture where children are apt to be considered a nuisance.... We now know that “Sesame Street” encourages children to love school only if school is like “Sesame Street.” Which is to say, we now know that “Sesame Street” undermines what the traditional idea of schooling represents.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985
