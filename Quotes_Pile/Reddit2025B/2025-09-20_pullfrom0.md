Also a faith that there are two and only two sides to problems, even when answer 1 is wrong and even answer 2 is wrong and humanity needs to find new answers and solutions. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

This Reddit response message is why we need to be teaching Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" that focuses on the presentation technique, entertainment addiction of television / high speed media. Why we need to be teaching Joseph Campbell's Comparative Mythology (with a focus on James Joyce, with his wife Jean Erdman, two Joyce teachers) and Marshall McLuhan's work on comparing media environments. We are not facing up to our fiction addictions, anti-science. Compulsive attraction to dehumanize our own selves in attraction to fiction storytelling and content. Anti-science self-harm and mindsets of attacking the Earth itself / attacking other people, the egomania that comes from fiction religion media systems, Edward Bernays content, Russian information warfare (Surkovian). This is a problem of our point in history of favoring egoism over reality. We had these problems before Russia started the year 2013 War Against Reality, gross misunderstandings and comprehension failures. We are not grasping the depth of the situation of 8 billion people. ... ... ... “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Left and Right both agreeing to murder and kill each other, shooting guns, is a problem. I want to describe myself as anti-murder pro-education, like Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan who is against violence and terrorist acts and organizing improved reformed teaching and self-awareness of education / learning. What I see is Reddit messages implying that "left" means you think murdering someone over their media presentation / fiction content creation (Charlie Kirk's fiction storytelling) is acceptable. To me it is not, and we are normalizing that killing and hate are not the problem, that the concern is left vs. right. ToDo: Insert link to The 1954 Equation.

He didn't just magically learn about Charlie Kirk being there on that day in public. Information systems matter, views of reality matter from what people consume. You are in a group of people with the same media consumption, just like members of a church consuming the same terrorism messages of out-group hate from the Levant information systems. Media ecology learning and study is not optional! Again, he did not magically learn of Charlie Kirk, this was not a relationship of Kirk stealing a love interest, this was a podcaster / media personality creating content and a media consumer / audience member who murdered the media content creator. Study cases like the murder of John Lennon. His media fame and fiction storytelling (The Beatles, etc) impact on society.

We (society) can't face that The Bible has many of the same problems of the Quran and Torah. That people hallucinate they hear magical voices when reading science fiction storytelling. What I call the Bible verse "1 John 4:20" education problem / crisis. That people have *not seen God*, have not *seen Jesus*, have only read a book. This is a media ecology crisis that people can't grasp that other books besides 2,000 year old Bible can induce the same patterns of mass delusions and mass hallucination.

They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

"The filmmaker behind cerebral political documentaries Century of the Self (2002) and The Power of Nightmares (2005), Adam Curtis, produced this short for BBC's "2014 Wipe" year-in-review program, which aired Tuesday night in the U.K. ADAM CURTIS, BBC: So much of the news this year has been hopeless, depressing, and above all, confusing. To which the only response is to say, "oh dear." What this film is going to suggest is that that defeatist response has become a central part of a new system of political control. And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time. Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics. His aim is to undermine peoples' perceptions of the world, so they never know what is really happening. Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads" https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

"this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, **love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group**. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.  **Now, today (1987) there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there." - [Joseph Campbell, age 83, 1987.
