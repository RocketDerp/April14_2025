Also a faith that there are two and only two sides to problems, even when answer 1 is wrong and even answer 2 is wrong and humanity needs to find new answers and solutions. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

This Reddit response message is why we need to be teaching Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" that focuses on the presentation technique, entertainment addiction of television / high speed media. Why we need to be teaching Joseph Campbell's Comparative Mythology (with a focus on James Joyce, with his wife Jean Erdman, two Joyce teachers) and Marshall McLuhan's work on comparing media environments. We are not facing up to our fiction addictions, anti-science. Compulsive attraction to dehumanize our own selves in attraction to fiction storytelling and content. Anti-science self-harm and mindsets of attacking the Earth itself / attacking other people, the egomania that comes from fiction religion media systems, Edward Bernays content, Russian information warfare (Surkovian). This is a problem of our point in history of favoring egoism over reality. We had these problems before Russia started the year 2013 War Against Reality, gross misunderstandings and comprehension failures. We are not grasping the depth of the situation of 8 billion people. ... ... ... “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Left and Right both agreeing to murder and kill each other, shooting guns, is a problem. I want to describe myself as anti-murder pro-education, like Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan who is against violence and terrorist acts and organizing improved reformed teaching and self-awareness of education / learning. What I see is Reddit messages implying that "left" means you think murdering someone over their media presentation / fiction content creation (Charlie Kirk's fiction storytelling) is acceptable. To me it is not, and we are normalizing that killing and hate are not the problem, that the concern is left vs. right. ToDo: Insert link to The 1954 Equation.

He didn't just magically learn about Charlie Kirk being there on that day in public. Information systems matter, views of reality matter from what people consume. You are in a group of people with the same media consumption, just like members of a church consuming the same terrorism messages of out-group hate from the Levant information systems. Media ecology learning and study is not optional! Again, he did not magically learn of Charlie Kirk, this was not a relationship of Kirk stealing a love interest, this was a podcaster / media personality creating content and a media consumer / audience member who murdered the media content creator. Study cases like the murder of John Lennon. His media fame and fiction storytelling (The Beatles, etc) impact on society.

We (society) can't face that The Bible has many of the same problems of the Quran and Torah. That people hallucinate they hear magical voices when reading science fiction storytelling. What I call the Bible verse "1 John 4:20" education problem / crisis. That people have *not seen God*, have not *seen Jesus*, have only read a book. This is a media ecology crisis that people can't grasp that other books besides 2,000 year old Bible can induce the same patterns of mass delusions and mass hallucination. The ELIZA Effect of computer screen users, documented in 1970's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect

"I had to laugh", laugher is the best mind-fuck. Russian information warfare, contradiction Surkovian governing techniques, exploits the mindsets of the population to be addicted to the amusement and novelty of antics politics. Entertainment trumping over science nonfiction.

Reddit community can't cite any nonfiction books, authors, teachers on the subject. Just off-the-cuff comments that are ignored in a matter of hours in the millions upon millions of comments created by the Trump and Putin situation. Unable to organize and rally around a common understanding of the depth of these mind exploits. Russia creates thousands and thousands of narratives since the November 7, 2012 agreement to create the Internet Research Agency with Cambridge Analytica’s payloads and schemas. Social media addicts use their *personal excellent good taste* to create filter bubbles of switching between the 5,000 IRA originated message patterns and go from fiction addiction to fiction addiction, avoiding learning nonfiction about Surkovian information warfare / Russian techniques itself. Russia won, USA lost since year 2013.

Short Twitter-length. No citation of author or books regarding War Against Reality from Russia, likely conditioned by IRA to think this just originated domestic. September 9, 2014 nonfiction ignored: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

Reddit comment messages that are amusement-washing the Russian War Against Reality, humor-washing on the Reddit amusement mill. This has been going on June 2015 when Trump became center of media attention. Comment creation addicts constantly entertainment-washing that it is not a serious problem that people fabricate reality or confuse fiction from nonfiction based on media consumption.

Funny mind exploit, finding it amusing when someone behaves in surreal and absurd ways. A basis of Russian information warfare.

Endlessly people keep trying to cram all world issues and human behavior into "left vs. right", over and over blind to the world because this one-big logical thinking. Bewildered that such nonsense confuses *other people* when they cite it like left vs. right as a measure of the world magically explains everything.
