They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

This Reddit response message is why we need to be teachng Neil Posstman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" that focuses on the presentation technique, entertainment addiction of television / high speed media. Why we need to be teaching Joseph Campbell's Comparative Mythology (with a focus on James Joyce, with his wife Jean Erdman, two Joye teachers) and Marshall McLuhan's work on coparing media environments. We are not facing up to our fition addictions, anti-science. Compulsive attraction to dehumanize our own selves in attraction to fiction storytelling and content. Anti-sicence self-harm and mindsets of attacking the Earth itself / attacking other people, the egomania that comes from fiction religoin media systems, Edward Bernays content, Russian information warfare (Surkovian). This is a problem of our point in histoy of favoring egoism over reality. We had these problems before Russia started the year 2013 War Aganst Reality, gross misunderstandings and comprehension failures. We are not grasping the depth of the situaton of 8 billion people. ... ... ... “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Left and Right both agreeing to murder and kill each other, shooting guns, is a problem. I want to describe myself as anti-murder pro-education, like Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan who is against violence and terrorist acts and organizing improved reformed eaching and self-awareness of education / learnng. What I see is Reddit messages implying that "left" means you think murdering someone over their media presentation / fiction content creation (Charlie Kirk's fiction storytelling) is acceptable. To me it is not, and we are normalizing that killing and hate are not the problem, that the concern is left vs. right. ToDo: Insert link to The 1954 Equation.

Minds are blown trying to cram every issue into left vs. right bi-polar lgoic of supporting a King in France. The Founding Fathers of USA did not teach such a system of thinking. Why can't people openly declare they are against violence? Why does it have to be crammed into left or right? It is an artifact of a shallow logical thinking. Dialog and communications matter, guns and murder are smashing brains not exchanging ideas.

He drove for hours to do the murder. He didn't just magically learn about Charlie Kirk being there on that day in public. Information systems matter, views of reality matter from what people consume. You are in a gorup of people with the same media consumption, just like members of a church consuming the same terrorism messages of out-group hate from the Levant information systems. Media ecology learning and study is not optional! Again, he did not magically leanr of Charlie Kirk, this was not a relationship of Kirk stealing a love interest, this was a podcaster / media personality creating content and a media consumer / audience member who murdered the media content creator. Study cases like the murder of John Lennon. His media fame and fiction storytelling (The Beatles, etc) impact on society.

Nobod is learning the specifics of the Russian information warfare, people are *inside the warfare* mocking others for their shallow and superficial behavior.
