"When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans--fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists--can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by [even] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways." - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. Chapter: The Kidnap of Mass Mind.

"Deep down in our nonviolent creed is the conviction that there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36 years old, as I happen to be, and some great truth stands before the door of his life, some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right, he's afraid his home will get burned, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot or beat down by state troopers. He may go on and live until he's 80, but he's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. And the cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated **announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died...** A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true." - March 8, 1965

Posting dehumanizing him as a "pug dog", and them calling him a machine. Reddit hate messaging to dehumanize as sport. Creating fiction content for fiction addicts. Encouraging MAGA values of superficial and shallow interpretation of the Cosmos. Dehumanizing the diversity of people's faces and bodies, communications. All to avoid nonfiction learning of socience, to mockery-wash the White House as entertainment and thrills for Reddit audience.

Including video games partner with Japan... huge money and wealth in using fiction storytelling on video games. a whole new one-time gain industry that didn't require a world war of violence to grow on and on for decades. 8) Recording industry of music / songs / films / TV shows. 9) Social media making some of the richest people in the world, Facebook owner. 10) Airports and transportation advances.

The answer everyone is avoiding: using social media, a world of 8 billion people, teaching morality lessons and making friedships long distance. Get every person in Russia and Israela and Palestine and document them in a global Wiki system and gift them, friend them, educate them, and stand up to hate itself. We almost all can now reach out and communicate peer to peer, even if just video and photos with language barriers, and we can adopt peer humans.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Reddit posting title "Fact Check" has no meaning, sports mentality of "MURDERED by Words!" is trash. The Reddit comment section allows multiple links and lengthy quotes, but the "education" people get is no-identity comment attraction. Super Bowl is a brain-damage sports (I worked on private staff for team owner who even runs a brain institution that avoids the topic). The anti-Wikipedia attitudes  of Trump-like conversational bullshitting messages instead of refinement and prizing of *we all have the freedom to educate and teach and get on the same page of important non-entertainment topics* instead of the freedom to  charm and manipulate other people into admiring Trump and Putin with amusement-washing and entertainment-washing that what the world neeeds now is every mind full of conflicting "education".

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ... JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That’s something else, and it can be done. BILL MOYERS By doing what? CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, rejecting the system’s impersonal claims upon you. BILL MOYERS: When I took our two sons to see Star Wars, they did the same thing the audience did at that moment when the voice of Ben Kenobi says to Skywalker in the climactic moment of the last fight, “Turn off your computer, turn off your machine and do it yourself, **follow your feelings, trust your feelings.”** And when he did, he achieved success, and the audience broke out into applause. CAMPBELL: Well, you see, that movie communicates. It is in a language that talks to young people, and that’s what counts. It asks, Are you going to be a person of heart and humanity—because that’s where the life is, from the heart—or are you going to do whatever seems to be required of you by what might be called “intentional power”? When Ben Kenobi says, “May the Force be with you,” he’s speaking of the power and energy of life, **not of programmed political** intentions.

USA is a ***Total Mockery*** of mocking back and forth with Trump the circus ringleader of social media / media systems / mainstream media / all media.

President Tony Clifton acting, the Surkov govening methods of Russia. The Reddit audience compusively mocks how terribe and bad Tony Clifton is - without learning anything about the nonfiction Andy Kaufman. Eating the Surkovian onions.

We "liberals', sent-identifying in binary of liberal vs. conservative logic. I'll tell you what I say as a person thinking in terms of fiction vs. nonfiction, the USA is addicted to mocking and insulting bullshit, over and over.

It's what you do in a Tony Clifton performance. Tony Clifton walks out on stage late, declares he is the must beautiful man ever to walk the Earth. And the audience goes into mental shock and eats it up. Then Tony Clifton declares he is smarter than all other people and that 2 plus 2 is actually 9. People cheer and hand over money and come back for more and more Tony Clifton performances.  That's the Reddit community audience.

On that date, the House of Representatives adopted two articles of impeachment against Trump: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On February 5, 2020, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on both articles of impeachment." - Reddit and other social media communities from December 15, 2019 onward should have stopped all low-importance use of social media. Cleared the room of noise. Asked for everyone on the World Wide Web to help out the USA who created the Internet - and we need your help. Please cease all entertainment and low-importance topics until we have impeached Donald Trump. Some time on or before December 15, 2019 - and sustain focus on it.

Nightmare world. People who claim that they are not what they consume, fund, vote for, upvote. Donald Trump has proven this isn't just "the Internet", and why I devoted my time to the Arab Spring since December 16, 2009 and traveled to Algeria December 2, 2010. Detachment from language, detamchment from their religion itself, despite claiming siad religion or said marriage vows and said children are the most important thing. If children are what parents love so much, voting for Donald Trump to deceive you and wreck all education systems of all the people your children will encounter is a self-harm aginast humanity.

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, **everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose**. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; **when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45.

When people prize high quanities of memes. From the **nonfiction public library section**  ... ... ...
"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. **I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985, page 174

So ignorant, celebrating ignorance, thinking this is a "civil war". Russia won, Putin won, Surkov won. Since year 2013. People embraced Russian memes and Russian insults. And if it were a civil war, it is being faught with powerful systems of health care harm against the poor, powerful media machines against We The People, powerful systemic attacks on world trade and supply chain. These are real-world complex systems that meme-think Twitter-thinking short-length addictions to memes and jokes don't cover.

Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.

People just can't face this isn't Germany and the technology isn't 1933. People can't see that blocking on reddit out of egomania is just like book burning. A media ecology lesson: They didn't have Unicode messaginga nd Reddit block buttons in 1933 Germany! The USA is a monster state all by itself now, Germany did not have nuclear weapons with mad men able to press a button in minutes to wreck people anywhere in the world! This is a terror and nightmare far beyond. People who are science trained know we have NASA and moon landing and things Germany with Hitler never could mind-fuck people with. OPERA_A Manic USA President with cult of deeath to humanity, death to Earth climate, poison harder / toxic Earth harder values. Did you read the news today? They say the danger has gone away! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq7FKO5DlV0

"Fuck this", instead of addressing the timeline and teaching remedial compassion, remedial love lessons, a media consumer attitude like watching a television show. This is real life, real reality, rescue humanity. Support Malala, she is teaching remedial compassion for Levant faiths.

Fiction addiction, the avoidance of reality through fantasy fiction Fox News addiction and Reddit comment addiction. Loving Reddit messages while hating human persons. Loving a screen video game while hating human persons.

"LMAO", finding Trump antics politcs and White House going after entertainment symbolisms such comedy engagement. Entirely addicted to the Surkov Governing techniques. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1nvjr43/trump_advisor_says_ice_agents_will_be_at_super/nh94lsf/

Entertainment addicts of Reddit meme machines calling out their wishes for the hyper reality. Entirely wishing for Directors at the White House to make year 2026 entertinment even more exciting!  This is a nation full of meme addicts who can't get enough of antics politics to feed their touch screen addictions.

Reddit addicts know that addictions to superficial and banal things are driving the nation. Alas, won't stand up and *be preachy* and lecture that that trash is shallow and superficial compared to loving one another and rescuing MAGA from Putin / Russian informationw war. Admitting that ignoring the Russian invasion of Reddit and other social meme systems was a horrible mistake and priorites need to change to be serious until all people understand the self-harm that fiction addiction and sports addictions have caused.

Very comptently serving Putin's messaged agenda of self-harm to USA. Not dementia, but focused execution. And not just one single person age 79. Elon Musk doesn't have dementia and serves Putin's agenda messages.

Relddit's whole community mob mentality tehnique is downovting down / punching down on ideas outside egomania. To filter out nonfiction and serious callouts. Same with Bluesky, block-happy cheering of deporting people with silence filter / squelch settings. Trump White House is implrementing Truth Social values of machine behaviors towards fiction addicts who don't like the fiction other people favor. Meanwhile, nonfiction and science thinking has been trashed in allt he ways Carl Sagan described in his 1995 book and January 8, 1994 public notice to We The People. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1994/01/09/with-science-on-our-side/9e5d2141-9d53-4b4b-aa0f-7a6a0faff845/

Unable to cite any author names, book titles, "tinfoil fiction" washing the topic, short-message washing a serious topic. Tinfoil hat itself has been exploited by Putin / Russia. It generates a contioned knee-jerk dismisall. Viwed as pitty and not a serous important topic. ... ... ...
“With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology, the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the worldview itself. Conspiracy theory replaces ideology with a mix of self-pity, paranoia, self-importance, and entertainment.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

Top voted comment, massive engagement. Fiction addicts doing fantasy politics. "Quit the union", serve Russia vibe politics. No leaders emerge with confrontation of Fox News HDTV vs. Reddit comment section, the low bar of measure vs. low bar of measure that is going on. Stand up for no taxes is MAGA values. Standing up for not payint for "the outsiders" and "deporting those we disagree with" from money and helath care is MAGA values. People are not standing up to die for nonfiction learning to pass down to children, Wikipedia educaiton for all humanity as a USA reputation, but out-group vs. out-group starve them / health-care them to death. Luigi December 4. 2024 went nowhere in grasping "we humanity are all in this together in leading the world". Except in gun-stroking sneak-attack murdering over health care Luigi values. Russia won, Surkov won, those with nonfiction spare time and free time on social media should be rescuing rural population with less education that Fox News has fucked over. Writing this is shit work. Nobody wants to stand up for authentic sustained goodness. Malala called all this shit mindsets out January 2009 onward.

Yet the faith in no-identity Reddit commenting that are disposable avoidance of nonfiction serious sustained learning keeps growing. Addiction to *breaking news* of White House bullshit. Addiction to Putin mind-fuck outcomes.

No link, no author, no book title. People have lost all sense of how many times / pattern of legal court and intelligence thinking failures. Tiny-short length Twitter-thinking messages rule minds. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1nvth7g/a_major_development_related_to_the_shutdown_is/nhb6sh8/

No link, no author, no book title. Yes, Jesus mythology is highly relevant. Surkov monomyth mind-fuck patterns of Levant are highly relevant. But this short-length-washing of the situation, this disposable-commenting-washing of reality is part of the crisis. Mindsets of goodness abandoned in favor of tiny-length snark.
