Denial abounds. This is a world war, not a civil war. Canada is screaming at you USA that it isn't civil / domestic only / domestic terrorism. It s the Ukraine war that you have not studied the Hybrid war about. ... ... ...
"Putin is clearly winning Russia’s hybrid war against the U.S. because Americans don’t understand how they are being manipulated. One of the main difficulties" - December 11, 2020 - "The Heritage Foundation" https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/putin-winning-russias-hybrid-war-against-america

It's terrorism / Hybrid Warfare. Super Hybrid Warfare. Terrorism plus Surkov monomyth mind-fucking plus dictatorships. A bundle of perfect storms. Surkov won.

Humans blaming humans. Males blaming males, women afraid of males flocking to other males for protection.

Reddit s an amusement mill, so the choice is always amusmenent washing when it comes to humanism. Not rescue, but mockery and calling it "all bots" and 3 living people, when Reddit has far reach to the technical / technology minded. Google Search landings, to technicla farmers growing food or technical video game players.

"When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans--fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists--can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by [even] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways." - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. Chapter: The Kidnap of Mass Mind.

Yes, and Reddit media consumers, Reddit comment media creators, let the Internet Research Agency invade media since March 2013. Can't even name the most hostile IRA enemy like they can name Paramount or CBS.

"Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings. And overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life. While poverty persists, there is no true freedom." - Nelson Mandela. February 2005. ToDo: find Mandella citing India as evidence of hard work and long hours of labor not lifting the people out of povery, huge numbers of peoople. Couldn't find the quote at the moment.

Eterntainment vs. nonfiction is the better measure. Left vs. right people constantly confuse. Neil Postman learning is essential for all people age 12 to age 120 to address these misunderstandings. Technology of media, "the mediumn is the massage".
