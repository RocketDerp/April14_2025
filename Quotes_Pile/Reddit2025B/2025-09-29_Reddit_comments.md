Denial abounds. This is a world war, not a civil war. Canada is screaming at you USA that it isn't civil / domestic only / domestic terrorism. It s the Ukraine war that you have not studied the Hybrid war about. ... ... ...
"Putin is clearly winning Russia’s hybrid war against the U.S. because Americans don’t understand how they are being manipulated. One of the main difficulties" - December 11, 2020 - "The Heritage Foundation" https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/putin-winning-russias-hybrid-war-against-america

Humans blaming humans. Males blaming males, women afraid of males flocking to other males for protection.

Reddit s an amusement mill, so the choice is always amusmenent washing when it comes to humanism. Not rescue, but mockery and calling it "all bots" and 3 living people, when Reddit has far reach to the technical / technology minded. Google Search landings, to technicla farmers growing food or technical video game players.
