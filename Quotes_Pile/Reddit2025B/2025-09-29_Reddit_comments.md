"When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans--fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists--can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by [even] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways." - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. Chapter: The Kidnap of Mass Mind.

"Deep down in our nonviolent creed is the conviction that there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36 years old, as I happen to be, and some great truth stands before the door of his life, some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right, he's afraid his home will get burned, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot or beat down by state troopers. He may go on and live until he's 80, but he's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. And the cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated **announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died...** A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true." - March 8, 1965

Posting dehumanizing him as a "pug dog", and them calling him a machine. Reddit hate messaging to dehumanize as sport. Creating fiction content for fiction addicts. Encouraging MAGA values of superficial and shallow interpretation of the Cosmos. Dehumanizing the diversity of people's faces and bodies, communications. All to avoid nonfiction learning of socience, to mockery-wash the White House as entertainment and thrills for Reddit audience.

We can protest and beg our elected representatives every 4 hours sutained and call for impeachment (but we do not, instead LOL amusement mills want fresh images). What an interesting concept. The reason USA voters and non-voters alike flock to Trump is to have Tony Clifton acts to make fun of. Eating the Surkov Onion.

Teaching history of USA in a different way might yield some people's realization. 1) birds so abundend they became a staple of food https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_pigeon and then gone. 2) buffalo so abundent they bcame clothing / housing and then gone. 3) forests so abundent they provided housing and poducts, the mostly gone. 4) One-time discover of oil, a technology of drilling out that isn't going to happen again. 5) One-time discovery of Gold in 1948 in California - that isn't going to keep happening. 6) Gold in Alaska... after purchasing Alaska... that isn't going to keep happening. 7) Relevant to this post about WW2 - then the development of computer industry driven by peace. Including video games partner with Japan... huge money and wealth in using fiction storytelling on video games. a whole new one-time gain industry that didn't require a world war of violence to grow on and on for decades. 8) Recording industry of music / songs / films / TV shows. 9) Social media making some of the richest people in the world, Facebook owner. 10) Airports and transportation advances.  So many things that can't just be "easily great again", because they are now much more used up. You see changes like this with "same store sales" vs. "new store" of franchise organizations.  Many unsustinable processes not recognized or educated as such.

The answer everyone is avoiding: using social media, a world of 8 billion people, teaching morality lessons and making friedships long distance. Get every person in Russia and Israela and Palestine and document them in a global Wiki system and gift them, friend them, educate them, and stand up to hate itself. We almost all can now reach out and communicate peer to peer, even if just video and photos with language barriers, and we can adopt peer humans. People care more on reddit /r/All about kittens being rescued that having each other's back. The USA population NEEDS help, not more Reddit comments avoiding the hate problems. We ALL need to be asserting and repeating The 1954 Equation. [../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md). Stop acting like hate is ejoyable, hate is not fun. Face the truth of hate. Have Pale Blue Dot pride, human species learning from errors pride.

The golf course banality of evil. “Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.” ― Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil. In Israel.

Wealthy can buy building-leveling bombs. And plan golf courses and resorts. Reddit audience flocks to bling bling wealth sports teams / racing teams. Amusing Ourselves to Death instead of listening to the hippies and Woodstock 1969 uprising of getting on the same page that world peace isn't OPTIONAL. Technology of weapon systems keep advancing, our love for one another is REDUCING. Hate is now popular on Reddit and people can't even name the Internet Research Agency.
