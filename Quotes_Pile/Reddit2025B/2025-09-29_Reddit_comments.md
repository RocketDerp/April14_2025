"When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans--fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists--can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by [even] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways." - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. Chapter: The Kidnap of Mass Mind.

"Deep down in our nonviolent creed is the conviction that there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36 years old, as I happen to be, and some great truth stands before the door of his life, some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right, he's afraid his home will get burned, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot or beat down by state troopers. He may go on and live until he's 80, but he's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. And the cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated **announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died...** A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true." - March 8, 1965

Posting dehumanizing him as a "pug dog", and them calling him a machine. Reddit hate messaging to dehumanize as sport. Creating fiction content for fiction addicts. Encouraging MAGA values of superficial and shallow interpretation of the Cosmos. Dehumanizing the diversity of people's faces and bodies, communications. All to avoid nonfiction learning of socience, to mockery-wash the White House as entertainment and thrills for Reddit audience.

Including video games partner with Japan... huge money and wealth in using fiction storytelling on video games. a whole new one-time gain industry that didn't require a world war of violence to grow on and on for decades. 8) Recording industry of music / songs / films / TV shows. 9) Social media making some of the richest people in the world, Facebook owner. 10) Airports and transportation advances.

The answer everyone is avoiding: using social media, a world of 8 billion people, teaching morality lessons and making friedships long distance. Get every person in Russia and Israela and Palestine and document them in a global Wiki system and gift them, friend them, educate them, and stand up to hate itself. We almost all can now reach out and communicate peer to peer, even if just video and photos with language barriers, and we can adopt peer humans.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Reddit posting title "Fact Check" has no meaning, sports mentality of "MURDERED by Words!" is trash. The Reddit comment section allows multiple links and lengthy quotes, but the "education" people get is no-identity comment attraction. Super Bowl is a brain-damage sports (I worked on private staff for team owner who even runs a brain institution that avoids the topic). The anti-Wikipedia attitudes  of Trump-like conversational bullshitting messages instead of refinement and prizing of *we all have the freedom to educate and teach and get on the same page of important non-entertainment topics* instead of the freedom to  charm and manipulate other people into admiring Trump and Putin with amusement-washing and entertainment-washing that what the world neeeds now is every mind full of conflicting "education".

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ... JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That’s something else, and it can be done. BILL MOYERS By doing what? CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, rejecting the system’s impersonal claims upon you. BILL MOYERS: When I took our two sons to see Star Wars, they did the same thing the audience did at that moment when the voice of Ben Kenobi says to Skywalker in the climactic moment of the last fight, “Turn off your computer, turn off your machine and do it yourself, **follow your feelings, trust your feelings.”** And when he did, he achieved success, and the audience broke out into applause. CAMPBELL: Well, you see, that movie communicates. It is in a language that talks to young people, and that’s what counts. It asks, Are you going to be a person of heart and humanity—because that’s where the life is, from the heart—or are you going to do whatever seems to be required of you by what might be called “intentional power”? When Ben Kenobi says, “May the Force be with you,” he’s speaking of the power and energy of life, **not of programmed political** intentions.

USA is a ***Total Mockery*** of mocking back and forth with Trump the circus ringleader of social media / media systems / mainstream media / all media.

President Tony Clifton acting, the Surkov govening methods of Russia. The Reddit audience compusively mocks how terribe and bad Tony Clifton is - without learning anything about the nonfiction Andy Kaufman. Eating the Surkovian onions.

We "liberals', sent-identifying in binary of liberal vs. conservative logic. I'll tell you what I say as a person thinking in terms of fiction vs. nonfiction, the USA is addicted to mocking and insulting bullshit, over and over.

It's what you do in a Tony Clifton performance. Tony Clifton walks out on stage late, declares he is the must beautiful man ever to walk the Earth. And the audience goes into mental shock and eats it up. Then Tony Clifton declares he is smarter than all other people and that 2 plus 2 is actually 9. People cheer and hand over money and come back for more and more Tony Clifton performances.  That's the Reddit community audience.

On that date, the House of Representatives adopted two articles of impeachment against Trump: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On February 5, 2020, the Senate voted to acquit Trump on both articles of impeachment." - Reddit and other social media communities from December 15, 2019 onward should have stopped all low-importance use of social media. Cleared the room of noise. Asked for everyone on the World Wide Web to help out the USA who created the Internet - and we need your help. Please cease all entertainment and low-importance topics until we have impeached Donald Trump. Some time on or before December 15, 2019 - and sustain focus on it.

Nightmare world. People who claim that they are not what they consume, fund, vote for, upvote. Donald Trump has proven this isn't just "the Internet", and why I devoted my time to the Arab Spring since December 16, 2009 and traveled to Algeria December 2, 2010. Detachment from language, detamchment from their religion itself, despite claiming siad religion or said marriage vows and said children are the most important thing. If children are what parents love so much, voting for Donald Trump to deceive you and wreck all education systems of all the people your children will encounter is a self-harm aginast humanity.

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, **everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose**. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; **when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45.

When people prize high quanities of memes. From the **nonfiction public library section**  ... ... ...
"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. **I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985, page 174

So ignorant, celebrating ignorance, thinking this is a "civil war". Russia won, Putin won, Surkov won. Since year 2013. People embraced Russian memes and Russian insults. And if it were a civil war, it is being faught with powerful systems of health care harm against the poor, powerful media machines against We The People, powerful systemic attacks on world trade and supply chain. These are real-world complex systems that meme-think Twitter-thinking short-length addictions to memes and jokes don't cover.

Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.

A media ecology lesson: They didn't have Unicode messaginga nd Reddit block buttons in 1933 Germany! The USA is a monster state all by itself now, Germany did not have nuclear weapons with mad men able to press a button in minutes to wreck people anywhere in the world! This is a terror and nightmare far beyond. People who are science trained know we have NASA and moon landing and things Germany with Hitler never could mind-fuck people with.

Common sense claim. It is not commmon experience and war and terrorism should not be normalized. And acting like terrorism is common sense, war is common sense, murder is common sense, just because humanity has a tradition and record of doing it. Soldiers from Israel go into palestine, peace lovers are not allowed to die in the name of peace, but military people are. And you can't just join the Israel military on a whim. But you can, anywhere in the world, call for peace and compassion. Death with a gun in hand as a soldier is considered "common sense" in a world that does not take *world peace* seriously and turns it into Reddit jokes of *whirled peas* mocking.

"**collective freedom of choice and action** is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition and/or behavioral outcomes.

Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral manipulation when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively.” ― Steven Hassan, Combating Cult Mind Control: The Guide to Protection, Rescue and Recovery from Destructive Cults ... ... ...

“In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

Yes, a thought-terminating cliche. So you don't look at more serious and important topics and instead parrot the thought-terminaintg phrase "you just used whataboutsm!" and it ends the conversation and thinking. Name Surkov, call it "Surkov techniques", and study how Surkov and Putin have controlled Russia for over 25 years.

He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

"What Cambridge Analytica observed was that when respondents were angry, their *need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced*. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical **trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits**, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the **Plot to Break** America, **year 2019**

Reddit comments like this fail because they think there is two and only two answers to every problem. Answer One: Rain falls upward. Answer two: There is no rain. Answer Three: both answer one and answer to are wrong and more learning and study is required. But since human brains have been educated to prize left vs. right, two answers to every problem, that all things are solved by thinking and interpreting rainfall as "conservative or liberal", there are TWO AND ONLY TWO answers and counting stops. People won't count beyond two "sides" to every problem. Logic machine addictions. Polarity.

We do not teach about these problems nor do fire drills / training to teach people how to not become detached from loving human people, especially strangers they view as non-person like they living in a ficiton TV show / glass screen of a television set / video game world through thier machine windshield.

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. **Now you live in a world of hate** and fear, and **the people who hate** and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. **Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility** even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45.

It's an important point, but needs context of other points made in this GitHub commentary.

We have built machines to communiate at very high speeds and share, but one-line Twitter-length commenting rules minds now. We no longer understand and cmprehend why hate is bad. Why ar is bad. Why harming other people is bad. Russian informationw warfare since year 2013 ha made people who worship hate. People who worship *hate harder* Trump. People who worship *mock harder* Trump. Mocking has become more powerful than understanding. Mocking requires no thinking or comprehension, just mocking away goodness by mockery-washing.

"Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language. By Megan Garber. September 16, 2020", "You might have come across the articles (“I Lost My Dad to Fox News” / “Lost Someone to Fox News?” / “‘Fox News Brain’: Meet the Families Torn Apart by Toxic Cable News”), or the Reddit threads, or the support groups on Facebook, as people have sought ways to mourn loved ones who are still alive. The discussions consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one. At this point, some Americans speak English; others speak Fox." https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/

“Everything is PR” has become the favorite phrase of the new Russia; my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. **To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided**, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, **year 2014**.

I have known self-declared conservative people who do not attack Wikipedia. But I also find there ia massive confusion and bewilderment over these terms "conservative" and "liberal". I'm for Wikipedia and sharing human knowledge, just as I am thankful for the authors in the public library who have died before I was even born. Such as James Joyce who died January 13, 1941 and I wasn't even born until October 7, 1969. I am pro-education, pro-sharing. I think we need some copyright reforms.

September 16, 2020", "You might have come across the articles (“I Lost My Dad to Fox News” / “Lost Someone to Fox News?” / “‘Fox News Brain’: Meet the Families Torn Apart by Toxic Cable News”), or the Reddit threads, or the support groups on Facebook, as people have sought ways to mourn loved ones who are still alive. The discussions consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one.

“In the way that scepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the sceptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us comes fully equipped.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

"We are never going back to normal again, because "normal" was already a crisis. What we refer to as "normal" is an extreme system built on exploitation of people and planet. It is a system defined by colonialism, imperialism, oppression and genocide by the so-called Global North to accumulate wealth that still shapes our current world order. Some people say that the system is now malfunctioning, but that is not true. The system is doing exactly what it is meant to be doing.

When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - November 17, 1957, MLK Jr.

Dear Leader is Putin, the IRA on Reddit since year 2013. But Reddit can't stop with the hate prizing and hate worship to see clearly.

People are dong shit, they are adopting the worship of out-group hate and repeating hate ideas on media systems day in and day out. That's not doing nothing, they are actively engaging and accepting that hate of human persons. Abaoning goodness itself and flocking to the total mockery networks of amusement and mockery at people.

The hood of Reddit community too. Conpetitive education, stepping on other people to push them down. Anti-wikipedia, pro Reddit commenting to drown out common progress of all mankind. Because univversity is competitive, can't get in without the right connections, competititon in learning is about defeating others.

"our media" had to keep an audience who got addicted to fiction. A society that mocked and amusedment-washed the Ukraine invasion by Russia. Who avoided learning the nonfiction serious subjects of Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency in favor of memorizing memes about Spongebob.\

Gun stroking messags on Reddit. Shoot everyone. Murder everyone. Kill everyone. Egomania messaging to mind-fuck Reddit audiences into addressing nonfiction learning of cult deprogramming. Cults of gun messages.

I don't see a coward. I see agression, I see hate, I see dehumanization, I see machine of a gun. Reddit constantly calls others cowards when what I see on Reddit is avoidance of nonfiction serious learning and favoring of low-effort comments in high quanitites.

Anti-education anti-citation anti-goodness meme addicts / entertainment addictions society that can not halt entertainment and be serious. This goes on every day all day, not just eleciton days, not just politics. The drastic change in year 2013 ans start of Ukraine war February 2014 that people wash away on amusement mills.

April 9, 1944, speech by then Vice-President Henry Wallace: “The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity… They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.” https://billmoyers.com/story/trump-the-american-fascist/

It is, and it has been gong on nonstop since year 2013 with no reversal. People will not face up to mass mind behaviors and face that addiction to entertainment and thrill politics, antics politics, is wrecking society. Those who have faith in hate do not see their own mental state regarding Trump. Mocking Trump is not resisting Trump, Surkov govening exploits all. The only option I see is self-awareness education from Neil Postman and everyone sobering up from the hate mindsets.
