Media addiction sharing, peer to peer sharing of addiction-stimulating content, is all the time. Trump attraction, magnet for fiction and fantasy addicts. Hate Trump, mock Trump, nothing has ever been more entertaining and engaging for people. Children are raised with Truth Social role model.

Russia has wepaonized any pattern of media that digs deep into emotion, upsetting people, and using the White House global media platform to reach every other media platform. ... ... ... https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-ceo-alexander-nix-data-firm-describes-shadow-election-tactics-2018-03-19/ "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

Denial of the Internet Research Agency, not citing any authors, not droping any book titles or links. Just claiming the out-group is dehumanizing just as conditioned since March 2013 by Russian information warfare. Machine (Reddit servers, media touch devices) dehumanization. Notable that this user declares they are Canadian with flair on the subreddit, yet can't name-drop Marshall McLuhan on media systems dehumanizing people.

Low-effort media shit sells, commments on Reddit without reference, constantly streamming millions of throw-away comments that don't want to stop the stream of low-effort comments. Trash outsells, just like it does on Reddit.

Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

Mockery on Bluesky and Reddit goes up every time Trump does an absurd surreal mind exploit. Antics politics for over a decade. Surkovian Russian techniques get people to flock to media machines and declare how terrible, bad President Tony Clifton is. Media addicts in reactionary addictions.

Nobody can defeat sarcasm, irony, absurd. For over 25 years, Putin has used Surkovian techniques to exploit minds. No defense has been found. It blows minds when you use sarcasm, surreal, absurd, irony, humor, amusement, entertainment on serious topics. People abandon nonfiction.
