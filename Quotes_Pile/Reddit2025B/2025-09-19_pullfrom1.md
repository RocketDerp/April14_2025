He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

Low-effort media shit sells, comments on Reddit without reference, constantly streaming millions of throw-away comments that don't want to stop the stream of low-effort comments. Trash outsells, just like it does on Reddit. … … … "We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

Addictions to fiction storytelling need to be understood, it isn't just modern memes on social machines, there is a long human history of fiction storytelling being given by parents to children and people falling in love with fiction poetry and storytelling so much they abandon science reality / factual evidence itself. This can happen with ANY fiction storytelling, such as Fox News or Truth Social fiction content, not just old media venues like the Mosque and Church dramatized science fiction poetry reading.

We can stand up to all hate in all places in all time periods. And not just stand up for hate upon Donald Trump, hate upon MAGA, hate upon this group or that group. All the world has a common problem, hate. We learned this from World War One and World War Two and the communications technology and book sharing technology / travel technology advancements. In 1954, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. published a new equation: ... ... ... February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr. ... ... ... "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true. That's what hate does. You can't see right. The symbol of objectivity is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Even hate on Reddit is bad, even street gangs on Truth Social is bad, Fox News hate is bad. Not just street gangs who walk on physical streets, but people who use massive organized technology systems and even entire governments to promote and praise hate.

Religion isn't *conceived* this way always. Science fiction storytelling is popular. Star Wars 1977 film was in some ways conceived that way from 1949 book "Hero With a Thousand Faces" on religion, and George Lucas has discussed Joseph Campbell's mentoring in interviews with Bill Moyers. But classical religions were adopted by government systems, such as the Roman Empire in year 380 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_as_the_Roman_state_religion - and Mohammad organized creation of the Arabic language and such. But fiction addiction takes on a life of own, Harry Potter fanatics, Lord of the Rings fanatics, etc. Reddit has a cult of Lord of the Rings memes / images / storytelling. The crisis is that people can't translate the popularity of Jesus science fiction storytelling / legends passed down, with modern science fiction. L Ron Hubbard demonstrated this in 1953.

People often find it amusing, funny, entertaining to watch out-groups suffer and be harmed by systems of religion and systems of government. Flocking to social media meme sites / entertainment venues, to insult and mock the out-groups without concern to eliminate hate for all humanity. Just to insult and punch-down on the suffering and people they consider worthless while cheering on Russia winning hearts and minds of Americans.

Only concerned with hate around one media venue, the Torah, and not the dehumanization with machines and hate on Reddit social platform. Only the out-group of the focus is the problem. Unable to codemn all hate in all places in all time periods, just the one cult of science fiction Torah storytelling.

Note the absence of name-dropping any authors, any books, any links. Just off-the-cuff messaging. People are not working together to rally around a common cause of over 8 billion people on Earth living together in harmony and peace.

People unable to match up the same patterns to Rupert Murdoch's Fox News saying the viewers of then network are the chosen ones and promoting out-group hate. Reddit messages too.

On Reddit, if Russia promoted hate all across the USA with a media invasion, The Internet Research Agency since year 2013, people won't rescue the rural less-educated people with nonfiction teaching. Instead, promoting constant hate on MAGA and Trump supporters that Putin's meme army in Saint Pete manipulated using Cambridge Analytica doctors. The pattern of out-group hate isn't just Middle East and physical geography of "Holy Lands".

This is a humanity problem that pre-dates the Reddit comment section, but people are not facing up that free time and spare time used by social media users is not promoting goodness for all people in all places. ... ... ... "The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world. The problem is with man himself and man's soul. We haven't learned how to be just and honest and kind and true and loving. And that is the basis of our problem. The real problem is that through our scientific genius we've made of the world a neighborhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we've failed to make of it a brotherhood." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. February 28, 1954

Who publishes and shares that video on Reddit? How far does the content cravings self-awareness go, including me commenting here on GitHub. My observation is: we have to trust people all over the world. The people who produce our food, spread a virus from Wuhan China in December 2019 that create a global pandemic, the people who message comments on Reddit,etc. Parents trust the school place and the teachers. It is an experience for the children and I suggest we all, all peoople in the world, rally around Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan in thinking and concerns about educating chldren and the value of school. Malala made a point October 2013 in one of her interviews concerning encounters with strangers https://youtu.be/gjGL6YY6oMs?t=864 "students are provided the same benches" "how to live with others"
