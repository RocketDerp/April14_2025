Media addiction sharing, peer to peer sharing of addiction-stimulating content, is all the time. Trump attraction, magnet for fiction and fantasy addicts. Hate Trump, mock Trump, nothing has ever been more entertaining and engaging for people. Children are raised with Truth Social role model.

Russia has wepaonized any pattern of media that digs deep into emotion, upsetting people, and using the White House global media platform to reach every other media platform. ... ... ... https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-ceo-alexander-nix-data-firm-describes-shadow-election-tactics-2018-03-19/ "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

Denial of the Internet Research Agency, not citing any authors, not droping any book titles or links. Just claiming the out-group is dehumanizing just as conditioned since March 2013 by Russian information warfare. Machine (Reddit servers, media touch devices) dehumanization. Notable that this user declares they are Canadian with flair on the subreddit, yet can't name-drop Marshall McLuhan on media systems dehumanizing people.

Denial that people misunderstand, misinterpret, do not copmrehend, etc. Tower of Babel metaphor denial.

Low-effort media shit sells, commments on Reddit without reference, constantly streamming millions of throw-away comments that don't want to stop the stream of low-effort comments. Trash outsells, just like it does on Reddit.
