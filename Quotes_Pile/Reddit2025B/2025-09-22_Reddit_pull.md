Note that on Reddit people self-dehumanize. Hide real name, hide real name of nation, hide any identifying links / author names / citations to back up their story.

“Many girls do not go to school because of poverty,” she said. “Some girls cannot go to school because of the child labor and child trafficking. Some parents do send their children to school because they don’t know its importance at all. And some girls don’t go to school because of the cultural norms and taboos. There are still many issues stopping girls going to school.” https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-videos/2023/08/malala-now-i-am-living-a-second-life

Why do we not teach this in our schools, even to adults. Adult education on how meda star predators opeate. The attraction people have to media stars / icon / status symbols needs to be educated to every person age 8 to age 120. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape

Reddit society can't recognize thier own joke-washing amusement-washing absurd-washing of Donald Trump that has been gong on for TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS. Zero sitautional awareness of Reddit media enviornment. We need to be teaching Mashall McLuhan's media ecology to every person age 12 to age 120 ASAP to address this lacking self-awareness of mind exploits by "jokes".

This kind of emotional attackment to media content, be it films / TV / music / Reality TV is exactly what people are not grasping and learning about Donald Trump superstar media content influencer. There is a lacking of self-awareness of the mob mentality / mass mind / mass man forces at play of popularity itself. Toxic popularity.

Yes, the "trick" of getting everyone to react-comment to every move and shake of the Donald Trump White House and Truth Social media platform and every content message of Elon Musk Twitter media. The *one trick* of exploiting a population that compusively flocks to Trump mock / Trump hate signals.

Notice the lack of date mention, link, specific sustained focus. Millions and millions of low-effort comments are what draws an audience, not serious public discourse.

Social media consumers on Facebook / Truth Social / Twiter drown in low-effort comments, millions and millions and millions of comments that say shit wihtout anything backing them up. Mental context change after mental context change, high-speed media valued more than understanding and comprehenion. MAGA and anti-MAGA are fuled by reactionary mindsets. Why isn't Reddit society standing up and giiving sustained educatioN? Every 4 hours asserting goodness for adult education on these critical and important topics, instead of constant focus on entertainemnt on /r/All - why can't teaching and learning be a focus until all of the USA gets on the same page of waht is important about the future of children and life on Earth?

Mockery-washing the situation as entertainment.

And it is a 32D level **Chess game**, being played by Putin. But Reddit comment community can't be bothered to sustain focus on how Putin ahs been planning this all for a very long time. Russians are famous for chess all over the world. December 20, 2013 **nonfiction** learning ignored: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ - Russia did this one month after the November 9, 2013 visit by Trump to Moscow. And weeks before the February 2014 land invasion of Ukraine.

Anyone who thinks this short-style mocking style of Reddit comment hasn't drowned comprehension and understanding in USA doesn't grasp media ecology.
