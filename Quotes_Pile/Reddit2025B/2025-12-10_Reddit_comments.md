And human city vs. empty ocean choice. The year itself is nothing magical about movement of nature and planets. Nobody seems to be discussing this. Birth of Jesus is a popularity topic. And it rarely seems to come up in anti-Jewish / Holocaust criticisms. And that unified media and travel is why Jesus religion now dominates calendar systems of India / Japan / China that Jesus wasn't center of. Let alone year 1492 and Americas.

Also when streaming video was new... people would have commented as to the video framing. So much black space, the mood music, links to the original. People just consume junk recording of a social media recording. Reddit used to have media ecology self-awareness. People scream "AI slop" and people used to claim this kind of video as slop with all the black / reworking (too much jpeg).

Common is people using automobile machines to stare into social media and kill pedestrians and other car drivers, but huge labor over the past decades has made cars safer for the drivers / safety features like seat belts and airbags and crumple zones.

It is the rarity, less common, that people don't see stabbing deaths - it isn't common. "Car accident and pedestrian deaths vastly outnumber stabbing deaths in the U.S.; in 2023, around 40,000 people died in crashes (with over 7,000 pedestrians), while stabbing homicides are typically in the 1,500-1,700 range, showing that vehicle-related fatalities are about 20-25 times higher than knife homicides annually." - Google Search summary 2025-12-14 All hate in all the world needs to be dealt with through global attitude change / learning / education.

Serious matters drowned out with amusement and entertainment engagement. It is seriously extreme to be attacking Canada as "51 state" in aggressive anti-goodness mob mentality. Public discussion and focus on group behaviors is how you address the organized hate and dehumanization going on.

Like putting innocent people inside an aggressive hostile prison to live changes them into a worse person. the whole society is a pressure-cooker of anti-health care, anti-reality, fiction addiction and Trump is a symptom of Putin's organized greed and war against Ukraine since February 20, 2014.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, **understanding goodwill for all men**. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

I was building personal computers and selling them out of my mom's basement in 1985 in high school and opened a hot-rot PC shop in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Working with "A Plus Computers". I even wrote a high school economics paper "RAM it to us" or some title like that about DRAM pricing. Nobody in my sports-concerned high school was writing about component prices of computers ;) "the Reagan Administration put economic sanctions on the country, effectively doubling the price of electronic products manufactured in Japan and sold in the US." - computer nerds were not cool in 1986 until my last year in high school, 1987 to 1988. But that story is another day. My comment about now late 2025: Trump economics and the USA society moving towards MAGA / Trump as leaders for children. Since June 16, 2015 a whole generation has been raised on Trump as a role model handed by parents. Fox News lifestyle. Building computers and understanding how the world works like Carl Sagan was teaching in 1994 and 1995 before his death is insulted and mocked by society in favor of praising billionaires.

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. **It is only now (1992) beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

The "point of" Reddit isn't love thy neighbor. People who love machines and speedy delivery of junk while raging at people. Reddit is a USA site that rages abut ICE secret police while having both people and messages disappeared in front of them all the time. Vince Gilligan had to say about social median at the start of year 2025. https://youtu.be/TkteSxVIM1A?t=648 "there's no simple answer for how we might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other" - speedy commenting that seeks hate, prizes hate, lead by hate-signaling leader Donald Trump all year 2025. Breeding round for those who admire hate.

There are children who got banned on Reddit when age 16 who are now age 24. Amnesty doesn't exist. It creates a very toxic non-learning society when people divorce / ban / child custody battle like Donald Trump says "fake news" and lives in alternate reality. Secret Reddit police who wear face masks / no identity. Just like ICE. Not done in public, people don't film Reddit banning / censorship of people. They just disappear*.

Surkov Paradox. The only reason you do this is to create information paradox patterns. And you do that because *it fucking works* as Russia has proven. Trump is a walking talking paradox, and people flock to it. Surkov was doing it on a domestic smaller Russia scale. Now the whole world is in runaway Surkov monomyth patterns that nobody is in control of. ChatGPT / GrokAI / Google LLM systems are crunching away on these human brain exploits. Christmas, Bible verse '1 John 4:20" - GOD IS NOT THERE! Every story combined is God. Not just ONE STORY Bible / Torah / Quran. But Star Trek is God, Pluribus Apple TV+ is God. Every imagination is god. That's the universe we seem to live in. Tower of Babel language.

Humans move around and language degrades. What more proof of this do you need? One subreddit can't talk to another subreddit! Latin jargon of the Catholic Clergy conflicts with Latin jargon of medical science.  The Tower of Babel is the most proven model of human behavior you can see! Children generate jargon! TV and films generate meme scenes. The first part of Thunder Word One on Page Three of Finnegans Wake - it's RIGHT THERE! Language is a forkbomb() until we decide to keep cramming all human originated communications back into a super large language model and find out John 1:1 spits out.

John One 1 is a metaphor! Campbell explained it at Jedi Gaucho Park California in some paradox time around Summer of 1986: "Each needs its own myth, all the way. Love thine enemy. Open up. Don’t judge. All things are Buddha things. It is there in the myth. It is already there.", "It’s been said that poetry consists of letting the word be heard beyond words. And Goethe says, “All things are metaphors.” Everything that’s transitory is but a metaphorical reference. That’s what *We All* are." (We The People All, *Pluribus* of John 1 : One)

We are fork-bombing John One One. Hell, the SAME PERSON at age 65 can't make sense of the video game they authored on a Commodore 64 at age 15. THE SAME PERSON can't even understand their own writing and authoring at different points in their lifetime. Because the mass man (University of Toronto term) keeps shifting around.

October 7 or July 10? 9/11 means what to most of the world? 11/9, Michael Moore got the Pluribus inversions, the language bit-flipping. Fighting over it is a poor idea. Bad ideas abound.

“For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

It's like in USA culture ever since the 1970's oil crisis. People can cheer on housing / rents going from $1,200 a month to $2,800 a month inflation. But gasoline going up from $3.20 gallon to $4.10 gallon and USA people notice. (And people who don't use that much fuel in a week only see this one item increase. So $40 extra a week on gasoline is big mental observation, while health care or housing can go up 4300 a week and people cheer it on). Changing the fuel but burning jet fuel to move race stuff around isn't seen by people who need every clothing item of a race performer to be spotless on camera. Describing how people prize burning anything to make noises and to promote more burning to heat up the earth with gasses is an emotional writing impossibility.

Marketing, advertising, public relations, mental manipulation is why Donald Trump rules Reddit society. People think they are not cheering on badness by adding hate to hate. Yet it goes on for over 10 years and 6 months with non-stop hate motivation and mass dehumanization. It isn't an accidental day or two, it's sustained power concentration and badness / anti-goodness for over a decade. Entertainer / Reality TV star entertains people with hate of out-groups. Different groups hate different groups, but hate drives it / self-harm drives it. Parents have made Trump a role model for thinking, business, success, winning. And Vince Gilligan February 15, 2025 about social media cesspool is correct of the society that thinks hate is not the core value of Trump and that hate of Trump and hate of MAGA isn't prizing hate / teaching hate / originating hate.

This is the audience of the world. The 3 Levant religions { Torah, Bible, Quran fandoms } have spread all over the Earth for thousands of years. And still bomb, knife, terrorize, kill, hate, dehumanize each other in name of an outer-space alien god that has been criticized in Bible verse "1 John 4:20" as being taken too far by audience members (for 2000 years). Conquest, greed, revenge, payback, hate patterns keep advancing with weapons technology. People say we are more safe, but the leaders in 2025 and the ability to kill and wreck the Earth keep advancing. And Earth with over 8 billion people doesn't have the virgin less-corrupted spaces to move to like it has in the past. We can't even face up to the blocking of each other on social message systems, let alone nations bombing and killing each other. The mental health workers people claim can "help" and fix things aren't addressing the entire nation of Russia for supporting Putin. Mob mentality, out-group hate isn't treated as seriously as a race car driver or sports star fumbling in their entertainment profession.

People admire and think war heroes are the greatest people on earth for murdering and killing while mocking away serious nonfiction learning as "boring" and "unattractive".

Hundreds of millions of people are entertained every day by "Epstein List" information and it goes on and on. Amusement "LOL cow" milking of Donald Trump because of joke-addiction over super-dumb orange skin and Trump's unique style of dialog and writing drives the nation. People can't find which page of the Bible says not to be greedy and discuss it relative to Trump (page "1 John 3:17"). People are attracted to his power and charms of high-speed media. Terrible taste in Reality TV and memes is why Trump has power. Neil Postman's nonfiction teaching about education and media systems isn't optional. Notice "The Office" fiction joke show is what Reddit has on front page. Trump provides fiction addicts constant content, that's what Reddit audiences won't face. Nonfiction serious learning gets mocked as boring or uninteresting. Trump is playing comedian President Tony Clifton character, and terrible bad joke addiction runs the nation.

Instead, people are only concerned that Trump has "fallout" from real estate deals. Always concerned only about white men and not shifting power away from the value of prizing this as leaders.

On Lemmy and Reddit, you can't find a single person wiling to stand up that Vince Gilligan's TV show "Pluribus" with Air Force One and Carol driving a Police Car has a single thing to do with politics.. Anti-engagement on nonfiction learning of the meaning of the Great Seal of the United States of america abounds. People are entirely unwilling to read serious books from Carl Sagan, Bill Moyers - even if they were raised on Star wars. Anti-engagement to goodness is extreme. Hate and mocking is all people truly prize. trump provides endless hate leadership. People enjoy hate of trump.
