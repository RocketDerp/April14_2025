And human city vs. empty ocean choice. The year itself is nothing magical about movement of nature and planets. Nobody seems to be discussing this. Birth of Jesus is a popularity topic. And it rarely seems to come up in anti-Jewish / Holocaust criticisms. And that unified media and travel is why Jesus religion now dominates calendar systems of India / Japan / China that Jesus wasn't center of. Let alone year 1492 and Americas.

Also when streaming video was new... people would have commented as to the video framing. So much black space, the mood music, links to the original. People just consume junk recording of a social media recording. Reddit used to have media ecology self-awareness. People scream "AI slop" and people used to claim this kind of video as slop with all the black / reworking (too much jpeg).

That avoiding the religion clergy, spiritual values of the nation (which is the spiritual value of the word "Pluribus" and great seal) is progressive, allowing Second Bill of Rights January 1944 and Dr. Martin Luther King's public dream reformations.

Common is people using automobile machines to stare into social media and kill pedestrians and other car drivers, but huge labor over the past decades has made cars safer for the drivers / safety features like seat belts and airbags and crumple zones.

It is the rarity, less common, that people don't see stabbing deaths - it isn't common. "Car accident and pedestrian deaths vastly outnumber stabbing deaths in the U.S.; in 2023, around 40,000 people died in crashes (with over 7,000 pedestrians), while stabbing homicides are typically in the 1,500-1,700 range, showing that vehicle-related fatalities are about 20-25 times higher than knife homicides annually." - Google Search summary 2025-12-14 All hate in all the world needs to be dealt with through global attitude change / learning / education.

Serious matters drowned out with amusement and entertainment engagement. It is seriously extreme to be attacking Canada as "51 state" in aggressive anti-goodness mob mentality. Public discussion and focus on group behaviors is how you address the organized hate and dehumanization going on. But people are more interested in famous people being killed in a bloody dramatic way as entertainment topic about entertainers. Like putting innocent people inside an aggressive hostile prison to live changes them into a worse person. the whole society is a pressure-cooker of anti-health care, anti-reality, fiction addiction and Trump is a symptom of Putin's organized greed and war against Ukraine since February 20, 2014.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

Trump has programmed Reddit audiences to hate people and love systems. Hate immigrants / hate for poor people for their non-standard usage of language and be more concerned with how people speak / push fashion - than what they have to say. Love for the system, hate for humans, just like Trump. ... ... ...        
"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, **understanding goodwill for all men**. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
