And human city vs. empty ocean choice. The year itself is nothing magical about movement of nature and planets. Nobody seems to be discussing this. Birth of Jesus is a popularity topic. And it rarely seems to come up in anti-Jewish / Holocaust criticisms. And that unified media and travel is why Jesus religion now dominates calendar systems of India / Japan / China that Jesus wasn't center of. Let alone year 1492 and Americas.

Also when streaming video was new... people would have commented as to the video framing. So much black space, the mood music, links to the original. People just consume junk recording of a social media recording. Reddit used to have media ecology self-awareness. People scream "AI slop" and people used to claim this kind of video as slop with all the black / reworking (too much jpeg).

Common is people using automobile machines to stare into social media and kill pedestrians and other car drivers, but huge labor over the past decades has made cars safer for the drivers / safety features like seat belts and airbags and crumple zones.

It is the rarity, less common, that people don't see stabbing deaths - it isn't common. "Car accident and pedestrian deaths vastly outnumber stabbing deaths in the U.S.; in 2023, around 40,000 people died in crashes (with over 7,000 pedestrians), while stabbing homicides are typically in the 1,500-1,700 range, showing that vehicle-related fatalities are about 20-25 times higher than knife homicides annually." - Google Search summary 2025-12-14 All hate in all the world needs to be dealt with through global attitude change / learning / education.

Serious matters drowned out with amusement and entertainment engagement. It is seriously extreme to be attacking Canada as "51 state" in aggressive anti-goodness mob mentality. Public discussion and focus on group behaviors is how you address the organized hate and dehumanization going on.

Like putting innocent people inside an aggressive hostile prison to live changes them into a worse person. the whole society is a pressure-cooker of anti-health care, anti-reality, fiction addiction and Trump is a symptom of Putin's organized greed and war against Ukraine since February 20, 2014.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, **understanding goodwill for all men**. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

I was building personal computers and selling them out of my mom's basement in 1985 in high school and opened a hot-rot PC shop in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Working with "A Plus Computers". I even wrote a high school economics paper "RAM it to us" or some title like that about DRAM pricing. Nobody in my sports-concerned high school was writing about component prices of computers ;) "the Reagan Administration put economic sanctions on the country, effectively doubling the price of electronic products manufactured in Japan and sold in the US." - computer nerds were not cool in 1986 until my last year in high school, 1987 to 1988. But that story is another day. My comment about now late 2025: Trump economics and the USA society moving towards MAGA / Trump as leaders for children. Since June 16, 2015 a whole generation has been raised on Trump as a role model handed by parents. Fox News lifestyle. Building computers and understanding how the world works like Carl Sagan was teaching in 1994 and 1995 before his death is insulted and mocked by society in favor of praising billionaires. And even then, if you look at /r/PCMasterRace - so much focus is on video games / entertainment / amusement. Not computers as learning and information systems tools.

[Context bewilderment abounds on Reddit / anti-Wiki values of comments that flow away after 12 or so hours](/Media_Ecology/Context_Bewilderment.md). It isn't just missing information, it is the speed of learning. University to become a doctorate is a very very slow process. Learning takes incredible amounts of time. Not high speed racing to comment with Twitter-length messages on Reddit. Emphasis this was written in year 1992: ... ... ...     
“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. **It is only now (1992) beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

The "point of" Reddit isn't love thy neighbor. People who love machines and speedy delivery of junk while raging at people. Reddit is a USA site that rages abut ICE secret police while having both people and messages disappeared in front of them all the time. Vince Gilligan had to say about social median at the start of year 2025. https://youtu.be/TkteSxVIM1A?t=648 "there's no simple answer for how we might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other" - speedy commenting that seeks hate, prizes hate, lead by hate-signaling leader Donald Trump all year 2025. Breeding round for those who admire hate.

Corporate America normal. Trump leading social media since June 16, 2015. **Over a decade of "Fake News" winning** debate. People raise their children on Trump role model.

Has Reddit. I have Reddit account permanently banned /u/RoundSparrow from Russian information warfare back in Trump's first term. Reddit didn't face up when IRA became disclosed. There are children who got banned on Reddit when age 16 who are now age 24. Amnesty doesn't exist. It creates a very toxic non-learning society when people divorce / ban / child custody battle like Donald Trump says "fake news" and lives in alternate reality. Secret Reddit police who wear face masks / no identity. Just like ICE. Not done in public, people don't film Reddit banning / censorship of people. They just disappear*. What a nightmare culture where love and compassion lessons are non-existent. The Christian Clergy in USA can't make Bible verse "1 John 3:17" front page and apply it to Elon Musk D.O.G.E. in White House and apply "1 John 3:17" during the government shutdown in 2025.

So Twitch is policing car driving. Like an Amazon driver being policed for toilet breaks.

Shoplifting crime as a content. Only wealthy Elon Musk D.O.G.E. with a chainsaw on stage can do love-streaming crime. Because he owns the media platform and isn't using someone else's like Twitch. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly25yny3ego

"And when that belief disintegrated, the culture disintegrated; it has disintegrated now. We are in what is called a wasteland. T.S. Eliott put his finger on it, back there in 1922, I think it was. What is a wasteland? It is a wasteland of people living without aspiration, going through the routine of their lives, doing things they are told to do because they don’t have the courage to do something they want to do, which would be a little bit insane. **We are in a realm that I would describe as a terminal moraine of myths. There are no end of destroyed mythologies around us**." - 1974? Campbell Cooper Union.

BILL MOYERS: So when we dream, we are fishing in some vast ocean of mythology that —

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: — that goes down and down and down. You can get all mixed up with complexes, you know, things like that, but really, as the Polynesian saying goes, you are then “standing on a whale fishing for minnows.” We are standing on a whale. The ground of being is the ground of our being, and when **we simply turn outward**, we see all of these little problems here and there. But, if we look inward, we see that we are the source of them all.
