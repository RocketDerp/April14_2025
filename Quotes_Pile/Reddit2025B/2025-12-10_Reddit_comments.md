And human city vs. empty ocean choice. The year itself is nothing matical about movement of naturee and planets. Nobody seems to be discussing this. Birth of Jesus is a popularity topic.

Also when streaming video was new... people would have commented as to the video framing. So much black space, the mood music, links to the original. People just consume junk recording of a social media recording. Reddit used to have media ecology self-awareness. People scream "AI slop" and people used to claim this kind of video as slop with all the black / rereworking (too much jpeg).

Sex symbol. How Putin won Americans. The fetish for Donald Trump content: orange skin color, humiliation of men, humiliation of status symbols. Abusive is in this comment, Trump's Reality TV "The Apprentice" attracted abuse / humiliation audiences "You are fired!" aggression.
