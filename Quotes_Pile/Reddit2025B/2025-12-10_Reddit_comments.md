And it rarely seems to come up in anti-Jewish / Hollocaust criticisms. And that unified media and travel is why Jesus religion now dominates calendar systems of India / Japan / China that Jesus wasn't center of. Let alone year 1492 and Americas.

Also when streaming video was new... people would have commented as to the video framing. So much black space, the mood music, links to the original. People just consume junk recording of a social media recording. Reddit used to have media ecology self-awareness. People scream "AI slop" and people used to claim this kind of video as slop with all the black / reworking (too much jpeg).

That avoiding the religion clergy, spiritual values of the nation (which is the spiritual value of the word "Pluribus" and great seal) is progressive, allowing Second Bill of Rights January 1944 and Dr. Martin Luther King's public dream reformations.

Common is people using automobile machines to stare into social media and kill pedestrians and other car drivers, but huge labor over the past decades has made cars safer for the drivers / safety features like seat belts and airbags and crumple zones.

It is the rarity, less common, that people don't see stabbing deaths - it isn't common. "Car accident and pedestrian deaths vastly outnumber stabbing deaths in the U.S.; in 2023, around 40,000 people died in crashes (with over 7,000 pedestrians), while stabbing homicides are typically in the 1,500-1,700 range, showing that vehicle-related fatalities are about 20-25 times higher than knife homicides annually." - Google Search summary 2025-12-14 All hate in all the world needs to be dealt with through global attitude change / learning / education.

self-harm is an unsolved problem of humanity, humans butchering their planet Earth on a massive scale and promoting war and hate as exciting bad-guy entertainment and thrills. Many that Putin has wrecked suffer horrible lives for year after year being tortured by lies and bullshit and information warfare. Wrecking their health, health care systems, wrecking solvable problems of food needs / housing needs / health care needs in favor of constant feeding Putin war against reality year after year.

Lovers of machines who are thrilled by the speed and power of heavy machines. A society who loves technology of power and hates upon children. People will not talk about technology addiction and why fast-car man Elon Musk is leading the USA with Twitter and D.O.G.E. White House year 2025. The MAGA USA mass dehumanization praising, the hate of I.C.E. and dehumanization. Machine lovers on touch social intimate devices cheer it on as entertainment. People see tree after tree and not the forest perspective of our nation becoming lovers of machines. Charlie Chaplin's 1940's Great Dictator very clearly called out machines vs. brotherly love, and we don't have people doing that today in 2025 MAGA Trump leader of hate and mocking values.

Out-group hate of immigrants, other genders, other skin colors.

Hollywood fiction and TV entertainment, Reality TV star Donald Trump of "The Apprentice" break with reality on a mass scale. Billionaires creating ChatGPT anti-reality while Wikipedia free open learning is Langley underfunded and not encouraged as leadership for the whole world. Almost no ability people have to articulate these abandonment of reality concerns and organized information warfare that has wrecked USA. On a macro scale, people mock and insult and belittle the problem with "LOL cow" milking of Trump for over a decade. September 9, 2014 : https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - knowing your doctor and military people believe fiction is stressful and alarming every hour of every day and it has wrecked goodness. But people are so thrilled with the high-speed messaging to discuss breaking news - they don't see the entire mob mentality of society / forest for the trees at the macro level. The Reddit comment talks about "Relapse", Fox News audiences, re-election of Trump to a second term in office. 

Serious matters drowned out with amusement and entertainment engagement. It is seriously extreme to be attacking Canada as "51 state" in aggressive anti-goodness mob mentality. Public discussion and focus on group behaviors is how you address the organized hate and dehumanization going on. But people are more interested in famous people being killed in a bloody dramatic way as entertainment topic about entertainers. Like putting innocent people inside an aggressive hostile prison to live changes them into a worse person. the whole society is a pressure-cooker of anti-health care, anti-reality, fiction addiction and Trump is a symptom of Putin's organized greed and war against Ukraine since February 20, 2014. Mental health of mass mind, crowds, mob mentality, audiences is not seriously discussed with non-fiction learning.

And Reddit users eat this up on touch devices form billionaire media device corporations. There is no organized movement to resist the falsehoods and misunderstandings that come from Rupert Murdoch's Fox News and advertising and marketing networks. Instead, people cheer on that low-educated rural people are ignorant about how billionaires like Rupert Murdoch and Putin wreck minds - people on Reddit treat t as as funny jokes and mock back and forth in feedback loops based on their choice of HDTV channel or subreddit. Serious nonfiction and study of the problem is avoided, Humor and jokes constantly drowning out any effort to rescue or progress beyond this exploitation of brains. ... ... ...          
“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.
