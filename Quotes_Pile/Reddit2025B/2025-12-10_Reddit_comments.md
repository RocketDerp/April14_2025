And human city vs. empty ocean choice. The year itself is nothing matical about movement of naturee and planets. Nobody seems to be discussing this. Birth of Jesus is a popularity topic. And it rarely seems to come up in anti-Jewish / Hollocaust criticisms. And that unified media and travel is why Jesus religion now dominates calendar systems of India / Japan / China that Jesus wasn't center of. Let alone year 1492 and Americas.

Neil Postman 1985 quote about media ecology and trivial. Carl Sagan 1995 and the length of the media comments

Also when streaming video was new... people would have commented as to the video framing. So much black space, the mood music, links to the original. People just consume junk recording of a social media recording. Reddit used to have media ecology self-awareness. People scream "AI slop" and people used to claim this kind of video as slop with all the black / rereworking (too much jpeg).

Sex symbol. How Putin won Americans. The fetish for Donald Trump content: orange skin color, humiliation of men, humiliation of status symbols. Abusive is in this comment, Trump's Reality TV "The Apprentice" attracted abuse / humiliation audiences "You are fired!" aggression.

People learn from fiction. Nonfiction serious learning / lectures are abandoned and ignored in favor of fiction. See my next comment, a reply.

Like having sincere content all over the Internet that isn't a booby-trap by billionares like Elon Musk, Rupert Murdoch. That Truth Social is true. That Wikipedia isn't manipulated by strangers who want to make people get diseases (measles) and spread information wrfare. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 That Reddit comments aren't the most sophisticated doctors from Cambridge Analytica. That a woman on the street feels safe. That attraction to a skate board is safe. Although I suggest people have a helmet just like a bike. Training wheels on bikes are also a real thing. Ice skating / roller skating / skateboard / surf board / tight rope walking take some balance experience. OPERA_A February 19, 1977 live broadcast. The year 1.

Not actual humanism and unity of spiritual meaning. Just joking away here in amusement land about others suffering. Out-group mockery. The social media society (all media platforms) "fuck around and find out" is the very basis of I.C.E. and Putin power. Wrecking humanism of people who "fuck around" with those who worship power, worship Putin's prizing of power. Social media society turns it into entertainment about falling out of a window for LOL memes.
