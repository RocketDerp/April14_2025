Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

Reddit community has no self-awareness of compusive behaviors to be drawn to the visuals of a public murder filmed by live audience of 3,000 people who almost all own moden smartphones with high-speed TCP/IP network in the middle of a university complex.

 George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): "JOSEPH CAMPBELL: "A new order of the world." This is a new order of the world. And the saying above, "Annuit Coeptis," means "He has smiled on our accomplishments" or "our activities." BILL MOYERS: He -- JOSEPH CAMPBELL: He, the eye, what is represented by the eye. Reason. In Latin you wouldn't have to say "he," it could be "it" or "she" or "he."

Minds blown, memories gone, constantly consuming millions and millions of Reddit short comment messages. Reddit discussing a podcaster influencer and completely avoiding the nonfiction public library learning on the topic. Just comment after comment. ... ... ... “In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin’s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, 2014

Turning the USA into a Total Mockery values nation. Endlessly name-calling, trash-talking, insulting, hate-message of Ameican people. To turn the USA into a unwelcome nation on the world stage of history. Surkov spelled out that the Ukraine war would not end. This was publsihed December 31, 2014 on the BBC by Adam Curtis: "A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9_L9GRRsQo

Including preventative and emergency care?

Even hospital software apps and doctors office apps to be open source and shared all across the world for common improvement. We all have a physical body, we all have a brian for mental health, why are we not sharing and pooling together in common cause?

Media addiciton to low-effort no-identtiy comments drowns out repeating important *we all need to get on the same page* topics. Social media sites like Bluesky communities and Reddit communities do not re-assert important topics. The "Epstein List" QAnon focus seems more motivated aobut people wanting to get Bill Clinton in trouble than actually adressing the avoidance of nonfiction. Why can't pepole use social media to have every Friday and Tuesday be days to REPEAT important topics and have soeone lead an agenda of staying focused.

Charlie Kirk was a gun worshipers, did more guns and m urder solve the Chrlie Kirk media cult problem? Cult deprogramming is how you solve a cult. Teaching and learning, it can take years of extreme effot. Ask teachers how easy it is is to teach people in a cult But that's the job. Not mocking peopple, but rescuing people. We are an intelelctually homeless generation. So mind-fucked by Russia that people can not engage nonfiction learning. Addiction to memes and trash MAGAc Trump content has wrecked the minds. Russia won since year 2013.

MAGA values are shallow and superficial. RFK Jr says he can diagnose by just looking. Poorly trained police can tell someone is an illegal immigrant just by superficial and shallow obsevations. Reddit messages to further program this shallow thinking in the  Reddit audience.

There is no substitute for a self-aware intelligent population and leaders. Addiction to jokes has ruined the nation. Amusement addiction USA. If people don't care about goodness and avoid it as boring, this is the outcomes we are living in.

Once you mater manipulating media, you can work in almost any business. Farmers can manipulate media and earn government payouts. Computer makers can master manipulating media and build a brand loyalty with messaging and popularity alone. It's not a s if Reddit consumers read articles and perform tests to validate claims. The  USA is driven by messaging popularity and trending. Elon Musk knew to purchase Twitter to wreck the people he hates, everyday people. Going down with the ship. As long as you are steering the ship. Run the ship into the rocks or drwon everyone. Joyriding a nation with media systems.

Manipulation works in almost any profession. Convicing others to believe falsehoods is a skill that works.
