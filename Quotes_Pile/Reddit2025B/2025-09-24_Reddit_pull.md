A technology machine for walking that White House does not grasp. A reading machine for messagibg that the White House does not grasp. Media ecology comprehension is not optional. Avery person age 12 to age 120 needs urgent remedial education. People are not even self-aware of their own mindsets. A 79 year old man lashing out at machines.  ... ... ... “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, year 1992

Reddit community comments are surrounded by low-effort comments by the millions and millions. Comments that are disposed of for the next fresh posting page for a new set of low-effort comments. Atni-Wikipedia Anti-Wiki where *refined knowledge* and progress are valued... instead on Reddit postings, quanitity of disposable messages is valued. Garbage comments into mind, garbage communications to the world. Garbage in, garbage out learning.

Jesus was pretty smart about not avoiding problems. Love Thy Enemy. Seek to *defeat the Internet Research Agency / Cambridge Analytica systems*, the Surkov Governing systems, not the people. You want people to learn and understand why hate is self-harm. ... ... ... "Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - Martin Luther King Jr. November 17, 1957

This is why we need to urgently teach Conparative Mythology to all people age 12 to age 120. Parents have raised children in USA with the inported Levant Bible stories. In the Torah / Bible / Quarn science fiction trillogy, the character of Yaweh / Allah / God is a male agressive man who pushes around people. Many business owners and employees both think that being abused and hated by a leader is goodness. We have religion interpretation of Levant stories ass-backwards, totally inverted, as explained here: https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

Comment sections all over the Internet are busy mocking Trump. Intentional Tony Clifton act or improvisation speech at the podium on the subject. People can not get enough of mocking President Tony Clifton's boasting and bragging of how great he is and how great the USA is. It blows minds into media addiction states. Trump owned casinos, slop machine addictions, media machine addctions. ... ... ... “We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and **“engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do**. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, 2019

Until recently. When people made Reddit comments their interpretation of the world, abandoning citations / author names / book titles in favor of non-identity low-effort comments by the millions. Before Twitter became the source of Donald Trump leadershp. Before Elon Musk purchased Twitter to lead the world. Before Truth Social technology became center of all other media systems topics. ... ... ... “With the rise of Technopoly, one of those thought-worlds disappears. Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

These are th ecomments that have replaced researched journalism under Trump content king. This is what people crave and desire, diaper and poop message fetish for Trump. No other Preisdent can provide so much entertainmenta and baby-talk. Truth Social is what people can't resist, the medium, the Reddit comment behaviors. ... ... ... “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Media ecology learning is not optional. Every person age 12 to age 120 needs to learn media ecology in this always media world. And video clips and images need to have factual information explaining more. People attracted to wild and crazy content (Reddit front page, amusement mills) need to view thier own beahvior as addictions.
