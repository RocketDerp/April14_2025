Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

Reddit community has no self-awareness of compusive behaviors to be drawn to the visuals of a public murder filmed by live audience of 3,000 people who almost all own moden smartphones with high-speed TCP/IP network in the middle of a university complex.

 George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): "JOSEPH CAMPBELL: "A new order of the world." This is a new order of the world. And the saying above, "Annuit Coeptis," means "He has smiled on our accomplishments" or "our activities." BILL MOYERS: He -- JOSEPH CAMPBELL: He, the eye, what is represented by the eye. Reason. In Latin you wouldn't have to say "he," it could be "it" or "she" or "he."

Minds blown, memories gone, constantly consuming millions and millions of Reddit short comment messages. Reddit discussing a podcaster influencer and completely avoiding the nonfiction public library learning on the topic. Just comment after comment. ... ... ... “In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin’s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, 2014

Since March 2013 the Russian Internet Research Agency has been wrecking hearts and minds of the enemy via Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Making absurd Trump and surreal MAGA the center of endless mockery. Turning the USA into a Total Mockery values nation. Endlessly name-calling, trash-talking, insulting, hate-message of American people. To turn the USA into a unwelcome nation on the world stage of history. Surkov spelled out that the Ukraine war would not end. This was published December 31, 2014 on the BBC by Adam Curtis: "A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9_L9GRRsQo

Even hospital software apps and doctors office apps to be open source and shared all across the world for common improvement.

That if we hate upon MAGA people, which prizes hate from Trump, we are somehow taking a "high road" of joining in a hate for hate values.

Why didn't Reddit media users use Reddit to sustain focus on important topics? Media addiction to low-effort no-identity comments drowns out repeating important *we all need to get on the same page* topics. Social media sites like Bluesky communities and Reddit communities do not re-assert important topics. The "Epstein List" QAnon focus seems more motivated about people wanting to get Bill Clinton in trouble than actually addressing the avoidance of nonfiction. Why can't people use social media to have every Friday and Tuesday be days to REPEAT important topics and have someone lead an agenda of staying focused. And stop with the never-ending sports games and other topics. At some people people need to act like this is a REAL WAR with REAL HEALTH CARE and REAL FUTURE being wrecked. Give up non-essential games and sports discussion and actually focus on serious nonfiction hard problems. Blah. We have drowned ourselves in so much amusement-washing and entertainment addiction.

We are an intellectually homeless generation. So mind-fucked by Russia that people can not engage nonfiction learning. Addiction to memes and trash MAGA / Trump content has wrecked the minds.

Computer makers can master manipulating media and build a brand loyalty with messaging and popularity alone. It's not a s if Reddit consumers read articles and perform tests to validate claims.

How many people self-identify as entertainment addicts, fiction addicts, who avoid non-fiction learning of Reddit media ecology when quizzed on Reddit? Polling / surveys. no education on self-awareness. MAGA people don't realize they are MAGA. ... ... ... “In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is **certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up**. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as **the pollsters tell us**. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985.

Everything is simple and trivial. Education can require decades of incredibly difficult work to comprehend important topics. Alas, low-effort trivial comments are how people learn. Especially if they are incorrect and claim complex things are simple. ... ... ... "And I think that… the way people deal with this is interesting. They deal with it as a form of complexity, a word I have used probably too many times. It makes the people caught in this cusp between an old world and an old paradigm that is dying and a new one that cannot really yet be born. And we find ourselves in that space. And it draws us to people like Ross Perot who say “It’s just that simple… it’s just that simple… it’s just that simple”. That’s the most powerful political rhetoric in a world with a postmodern trajectory. God, how we would love it if someone could tell us anything was “just that simple”, and then of course when you see a pie chart you go “Oh, a pie chart…”. I mean, it has more religious meaning now than a crucifix to see a pie chart. I mean, because…. why is that so popular? Because it reduces complexity. The complexity is very real but his little soundbites, his little conversations with Larry King help to reduce that complexity and they put another message in there: “Now I know it’s real complicated but we can fix it, Americans have always fixed it and we can fix it”. Well, if Baudrillard’s right we have fixed it alright. We have fixed it all the way up and down. And I mean, you know, we see other people engaging in this same, sort of, attempting to reduce complexity. I mean, the political parties, to the extent that they exist at all anymore as anything other than fund raising devices, which I don’t know. I don’t think they have any ideologies because in a postmodern situation who would have an ideology except just as a momentary thing?" https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

The lack of USA self-awareness. ... ... ... “The other nine, decent, hard-working, ordinarily intelligent and honest men, did not know before 1933 that Nazism was evil. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil. And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45. Published 1955.

You should have to declare if you believe Star Wars 1977 is nonfiction. Declare if you think Quran from year 635 is nonfiction. Declare if you think The Bible is nonfiction. Declare if you think Reddit comments are nonfiction. Declare if you think Truth Social is nonfiction. Declare if you think Fox News HDTV is nonfiction. People can and do create fiction content, Hollywood films and TV shows are incredibly popular. People go to university to learn fiction. People go to Reddit comment sections to learn fiction. People go to Truth Social to learn fiction. A university and Reddit are both teaching systems. Just like Newsmax and Fox News are teaching systems.

Observations about the way the world *actually works*. 1) Donald Trump is popular because hate messages and team sports of A hates B and B hates A are popular. 2) Entertainment leader Donald Trump, Reality TV "The Apprentice" star Donald Trump is what people flock to every day on Reddit / Bluesky / Twitter / Fox News entertainment venues. Amusement mills. 3) Putin won an information war against Reddit using the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica since year 2013 and Reddit community can not go to nonfiction books and learning on the subject. Denial abounds. 4) Sports and fiction are very popular and sports-based governing and entertainment-based governing is far more popular than science-based nonfiction serious thinking governing. "Sleep Joe Biden" and intelligence is boring in the real world of screen game addicts.  5) The human brain is not a logic machine.  ... ... ...

He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

Everyone should have their own personal interpretation of which side of the road to drive their car on. What a mind-fuck message payload on Reddit systems. That the most important thing is nobody agrees. Choose your own fiction, exactly what Donald Trump and Putin are promoting, fiction over nonfiction reality. Every person lets their own favorite science fiction school or Fox News HDTV teachers determine what is important. While actual serious and important difficult topics are avoided. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a **favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow**, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019.

Cartoon creators learn fiction story elements. Like if a cartoon mouse on The Simpsons can lift a Cartoon Cat. It requires learning. Fiction content creation is not magical or supernatural.

"It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable.

MAGA doesn't like nonfiction. Reddit doesn't like nonfiction. Putin won the War Against Nonfiction. Defined September 9, 2014 in this article: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

Insulting and mocking and short-tiny messaging on Reddit. This is the problem, Twitter-thinking simplicity that Russia has used to wreck the mindsets of USA since year 2013.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1nq9j7g/bruce_springsteen_rips_democrats_were_desperately/ng5n6sk/

Low-effort comments on Reddit are popular. People who spend 3 hours reading thousands of low-effort disposable message comments who won't read 3 pages about how Russia is defeating the USA in an information war. Because it isn't considered attractive or entertaining enough to repeat and sustain focus on. Where Trump and RFK Jr gets constant focus and attention. Fox News antics of fiction are what sell. Nonfiction will not draw Reddit attention on the problem of attention itself being focused on fiction and low-effort disposable commenting.

Bernie is too old. And the Reddit comment section can't even make REDDIT leaders good. Why can't new 35 year old and 40 year old people be found in all the Internet USA to lead? Where are the people with good ideas and honest sincere nonfiction leadership? Bernie Sanders is very very old. There is something WRONG that USA can't name 30 or 50 or 100 good people to lead.

People can read. Reading isn't the problem as simple as this short tiny-length message frames it. Comprehension, understanding. Wikipedia associations of topic to topic as opposed to Bluesky and Reddit streams and streams of comments that do not educate and do not teach! Junk messages commenting over and over and over without any desire for refinement and editing and getting on GOOD pages of "the same page" like Wikipedia / Wiki systems do! Addiction to tiny comments is wrecking complex understanding and comprehension that diverse democracy and a world of over 8 billion people requires. Simple-think Twitter-logic reactionary thinking is wrecking reason thinking. Since the IRA invaded USA media systems in year 2013, politics is now EVERY DAY ALL DAY ANY DAY topic. USA society did not used to be like this. There were not media machines cranking out topics of the White House all the time any time day or night on the most dumb-down Reddit-commenting style topics. People have lost all sense of goodness itself, bamboozled into Truth Social commenting all day and night by Russia! ... ... ... “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re **no longer interested in finding out the truth**. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.

Low-effort Trump ideas. Shallow and superficial. Self-harm the USA by avoiding nonfiction serous books and content.

And in November 2013 Donald Trump took a private jet to Moscow to parade women for entertainment. Since roughly the same time period of November 2013, everyday people with free time and spare time on social media in USA and elsewhere in the world have had every chance to promote and recommend we all assert Malala's October 8, 2013 book. Instead, I see Grey-rocking and avoidance. When terrorism becomes front page on October 7, 2023 - people are not repeating Malala's leadership asserts about terrorism.

The scariest thing to me is if people associate the removal of Donald Trump with the sustained focus on the magical Epstein List ... when the next self-harm leader comes along that doesn't have a child sex act, they still won't know how to remove a President because hate makes for bad leaders. Karoline Leavitt is only 27 years old and not on the Epstein List, but she should be removed because she manipulates / uses deception leadership / and uses out-group hate as the foundation for motivation. But people on Reddit act as if the only important focus on Donald  Trump is the magical Epstein List. Not removing Trump because he is raising our children to admire liars and falsehoods, to trust liars like Putin, and hate harder as a USA motivation technique. OPERA_A I can't stand the hate attitudes, the faith in hate, and the worship of hate every day all day that Karoline Leavitt and Donald Trump encourage and promote.

September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET. “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to **make a few arrests — and then amplify the message** through his total control of television.”

Reddit users can't link any nonfiction learning, name any book authors, name the "Russian Internet Agency" or "Cambridge Analytica", no book titles. Addicted to shallow information. Low-effort comments that get abandoned hours later, people using social machines with spare time and free time, is a distraction from organizing sustained important focus on nonfiction learning of how Russia won an information war since year 2013.

Russian information warfare since March 2013 has blown minds of USA population.

Amazing that these people on Reddit comment sections believe drowning serious important nonfiction information about Russian information warfare with millions and millions of low-effort disposable comment messages isn't the problem. That people unable to get on the same page of serious topics, like refined knowledge of Wikipedia, isn't important - and more and more low-effort commenting is what the USA should be spending free time and spare time to educate the population with.

The mindsets that interprets as this comment messages is toxic and self-harm to USA. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

People imagining that a VPN within USA to reach Reddit won't be detectable. Magical thinking. Directly making changes to Reddit servers by order of the federal government as anti-terrorism can be done without public notice. Even an operating system update can be ordered. Mobile networks and land lines ordered. No-identity social media can be banned. People need to face up that there has been no high road taken. Being willing to die for goodness is important to comprehend. Standing up for hate and dehumanization of out-groups has lead us here. These are mind problems of the human brain,not just USA. Domestic Russia self-harm and mindsets of attacking Ukraine are a threat to all humanity. Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan is one of the few to get on the world stage and sing John Lennon's Imagine song to current times and in detail. Palestine had a hate and terror problem that taught Israel to hate harder. Palestine did not stand up for Malala's messages of October 8,, 2013 - a decade earlier. We are originating a world of hate, humanity is communicating the world over on the WWW that we prize hate. Putin won, Surkov won, since year 2013. The USA in 2025 is broadcasting "Hate Rules, Adopt Hate" as a role model.

Reddit community has been programmed to silence goodness itself as non-entertaining since year 2013 by the IRA. Most Reddit users didn't even notice the change. The avoidance of non-fiction and favoring fiction trash. That was BEFORE ChatGPT, which year 2022 onward worsened the fiction and insincere content issues. People fundamentally do not grasp Carl Sagan's 1995 book about thinking and fiction films and fiction TV shows. Star Wars Andor is not solving problems through a peace movement across the galaxy, because fiction addicts want war in "Star Wars", terrorism and bright explosions. The addiction to Torah science fiction violence / Bible science fiction Hell punishment and Judgment Day horror film stories / Quran science fiction isn't being taken seriously. We put this into our minds, We The People glorify weapon systems as video game entertainment on a global scale. And we have not made the case for healthy peaceful life on Earth as an objective. We consider peace boring and mock "whirled peas" and "freeze peaches". Noting is sacred, nothing we can't turn into lust for violent entertainment and domination sports. Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan is one of the few to see that terrorism is going to rise up in the world one place or another if the whole world doesn't face the human brain / human mind issues.

People can't see past money. Addiction to fiction is self-harm to humanity. Terrorists mosques don't have a money motive. They have a science fiction storytelling motive. We are self-exploiting our own minds, unaware the Russian IRA has been exploiting our minds since year 2013. Self-harm and dehumanization. Machine and technology lust and anti-humanism.

And Germany did not have the information systems technology we have in USA. People are unable to face how much technology has changed the USA and why Elon Musk purchased Twitter (and Reddit society mocked and mocked the Twitter purchase). Reddit can be stealth nationalized or loudly nationalized. The avoidance of nonfiction abounds, deep denial and retreat to fiction. “The underlying ideology within social media is not to enhance choice or agency, but rather to narrow, filter, and reduce choice to benefit creators and advertisers. Social media herds the citizenry into surveilled spaces where the architects can track and classify them and use this understanding to influence their behavior. If democracy and capitalism are based on accessible information and free choice, what we are witnessing is their subversion from the inside.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America,**year 2019**

First person shooters and high-budget Star Wars Andor fiction content. Malala was on the world stage standing up to fiction addictions to The Bible and Quran and Torah, and people ignored her. Women teaching have been a peace thread that has held humanity together. Now Joe Rogan is the teacher, Charlie Kirk is the teacher, male sports starts are the teachers. The fiction of Allah being a male who dominates has won mindsets. Jesus is now pro-Trump Texas kick-ass gun-slinger in the minds of the world. The cross symbol has been reprogrammed by the IRA, Putin won since year 2013. Fox News audience rocks back and forth changing the Fox News fiction story. What was wrong with Malala's words? Why wasn't she good enough since year 2013? Why aren't Martin Luther King Jr's words good enough since year 2013? There was no high road taken, the high road sat empty. The High Road was reviving MLK Jr's teachings in the face of the Ukraine and IRA war against Reality since year 2013. The High Road was Malala reforming Palestine. The World Did Not Use Social Media Free Time and Spare Time to TAKE the High Road to a book: ... ... ... “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”

I don't think Germany 1933 had Apple iPhone and Apple iPad everywhere like USA does in September 2025.

“In the twenty-first century the techniques of the political technologists have become centralized and systematized, coordinated out of the office of the presidential administration, where Surkov would sit behind a desk on which were phones bearing the names of all the “independent” party leaders, calling and directing them at any moment, day or night. The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it **climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd**. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin’s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, 2014

Addictions to low-effort messages, avoiding books and sustained focused comprehension of nonfiction. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

Reddit comment section doesn't know the names of "Cambridge Analytica" and "Internet Research Agency" and see the forest of mutliple NATO nations reporting media invasions from Russia since Q2 2013.

USA had a good life and decent nation. But apprently Reddit messages are that it is very very very shitty to have a nonfiction based leadership. That's the mind-fuck of this message. Only Trump can provide the fiction entertainment, "the good shit", that Reddit comment section addicts crave. Constant mocking and insulting. Addiction to antics and fiction leadership signals.

As a society, there is an avoidance of Wikipedia / Wiki style refinement and progress of learning. Such as news reporting, WikiTribune. Instead, every person wants to play *relay game* of hearing a story on low-quality CNN or Fox News and then relaying it to others in messages. Infomation has become entertainment to people. Major breaking news events of bombing Iran from USA in 2025, Trump going golfing major breaking news events, etc. Charlie Kirk's dramatic murder in front of live audience really connected with people who have invested heavily in screens on their home walls and screens in their hands.

Russia mastered this as information warfare. This was published December 31, 2014 on the BBC by Adam Curtis: "A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9_L9GRRsQo

Humanity is shooting fish in a barrel for telling different stories and creating conflicts. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...
BILL MOYERS: I feel stronger in my own faith knowing that others experienced the same yearnings and were seeking for similar images to try to express an experience beyond the costume of ordinary human language.
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: This is why clowns and clown religions are helpful. Germanic and Celtic myths are full of clown figures, really grotesque deities. This makes the point, I am not the ultimate image, I am transparent to something. Look through me, through my funny form.
BILL MOYERS: There’s a wonderful story in some African tradition of the god who’s walking down the road wearing a hat that is colored red on one side and blue on the other side. When the farmers in the field go into the village in the evening, they say, “Did you see that god with the blue hat?” And the others say, “No, no, he had a red hat on.” And they get into a fight.
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Yes, that’s the Nigerian trickster god, Edshu. He makes it even worse by first walking in one direction and then turning around and turning his hat around, too, so that again it will be red or blue. Then when these two chaps get into a fight and are brought before the king for judgment, this trickster god appears, and he says, “It’s my fault, I did it, and I meant to do it. Spreading strife is my greatest joy.”

"One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying (Jesus) crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin’s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.”

MEDIA_ECOLOGY_LESSON For over 20 years now, the entire point of Reddit is you can create your own headline on Reddit. This is a living example of people lacking self-awareness that nothing prevents free people / free thinking people of Reddit to spend 1 or 2 minutes composing a better headline. No natinal law requires the headline that was used, people on Reddit could organize better headlines. But people are not attracted to or otherwise interested in fixing the issue. Instead, people imagine that all other people do not desire the headline as written - or do not work together to create "non-clickbait" headlines. This is not a monitary cost issue, free time / spare time issue (commenting takes time), technology issue, this is a social issue of people not coming together for a common cause or the abscence of even interprting it as a traggedy of the common causes. Tower of Babel metaphors abound, people imagine others would write better headlines when people are more motivated to debate and argue and conflict over *what is* a good headline. There AP write / wire servie / news distribution system often prodices dozens of reseller headlines for the same story and content (sometimes expanded or shortened content). Marshall McLuhan covers this in his March 1967 work several ways, I suggest this focus. The new medium is Reddit, the old medium is the click-bait news "the media" as people call it.
