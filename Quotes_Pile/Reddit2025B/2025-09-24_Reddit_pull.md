Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

People are so happy to see death solve problems instead of discourse and dialog and learning. Anti-Malala stance is popular.  "The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them." - https://malala.org/news-and-voices/malala-un-speech

Reddit community has no self-awareness of compusive behaviors to be drawn to the visuals of a public murder filmed by live audience of 3,000 people who almost all own moden smartphones with high-speed TCP/IP network in the middle of a university complex. The drama and blood flow of this killing draws media addicts.

Satire-washing Trump / MAGA for yucks and humor content. Turning everything into anti-reality. Mythology of Kirk.

 George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): "JOSEPH CAMPBELL: "A new order of the world." This is a new order of the world. And the saying above, "Annuit Coeptis," means "He has smiled on our accomplishments" or "our activities." BILL MOYERS: He -- JOSEPH CAMPBELL: He, the eye, what is represented by the eye. Reason. In Latin you wouldn't have to say "he," it could be "it" or "she" or "he."

Wake up to waht? "Wake", "Finnegans Wake' from April 1924 onward publication. Irish author James Joyce. All about Reddit "Media Woke" to no-identity comment messages without citations, without author names, no book titles, nothingbut feels-good comments that nobody stands beyond except to insutl and mock when challenged. Like Truth Social, like Fox News HDTV. That's what "Wake" means in "Finnegans Wake", media ecology.

And why can't people name a page? Why not publish a page on Reddit or GitHub and LINK it saying: These are the things that need to change in the next 3 months from this political candidate, and I have written 5 pages explaining why with citations and suggestions. Instead, millions and millions of low-effort comments are what people creave and desire. Truth Social trash media values.

NEW year 2014: "the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake.
