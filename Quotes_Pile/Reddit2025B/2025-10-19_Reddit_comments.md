“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45.

“The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jew swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45.

Mass Man (Marshall McLuhan Toronto terminology) / Mass Mind (Howard Bloom NYC term) vs. personal mind. Public dream vs. private dream. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

BILL MOYERS: Why is a myth different from a dream?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Oh, because a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and **a myth is the society’s dream. The myth is the public dream and the dream is the private myth.** If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn’t, you’ve got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you.

MOYERS: So if my private dreams are in accord with the public mythology, I’m more likely to live healthily in that society. But if my private dreams are out of step with the public —

CAMPBELL: — you’ll be in trouble. If you’re forced to live in that system, you’ll be a neurotic.

MOYERS: But aren’t many visionaries and even leaders and heroes close to the edge of neuroticism?

CAMPBELL: Yes, they are.

MOYERS: How do you explain that?

CAMPBELL: They’ve moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original experience has not been interpreted for you, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself in very difficult situations. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience — that is the hero’s deed.

MOYERS: You say dreams come up from the psyche.

CAMPBELL: I don’t know where else they come from. They come from the imagination, don’t they? The imagination is grounded in the energy of the organs of the body, and these are the same in all human beings. Since imagination comes out of one biological ground, it is bound to produce certain themes. Dreams are dreams. There are certain characteristics of dreams that can be enumerated, no matter who is dreaming them.

MOYERS: I think of a dream as something very private, while a myth is something very public.

CAMPBELL: On some levels a private dream runs into truly mythic themes and can’t be interpreted except by an analogy with a myth. Jung speaks of two orders of dream, the personal dream and the archetypal dream, or the dream of mythic dimension. You can interpret a personal dream by association, figuring out what it is talking about in your own life, or in relation to your own personal problem. But every now and then a dream comes up that is pure myth, that carries a mythic theme, or that is said, for example, to come from the Christ within.

MOYERS: From the archetypal person within us, the archetypal self we are.

CAMPBELL: That’s right.

Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**."

It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”

Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture **consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process**. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also **suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning**, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free.

I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show **entertains but does not inform**, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying **we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed**. Ignorance is always correctable.

Fiction addiction abounds. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" problem, people can't tell the character of God is a metaphor. Yaweh is an idea, a metaphor, a science fiction story character. People fall in love and fight wars for a metaphor / idea- and we don't chooseto teach that to everyone. We prefer to have predatory billionares make profit and power off it. Putin and Surkov monomyth self-harm on a massive scale apointing this. Death for a fiction story character. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...   

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It’s been said that poetry consists of letting the word be heard beyond words. And Goethe says, “All things are metaphors.” Everything that’s transitory is but a metaphorical reference. That’s what we all are.

BILL MOYERS: But how does one worship a metaphor, love a metaphor, die for a metaphor?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: **That’s what people are doing all over the place — dying for metaphors**. But when you really realize the sound, “AUM,” the sound of the mystery of the word everywhere, then you don’t have to go out and die for anything because it’s right there all around. Just sit still and see it and experience it and know it. That’s a peak experience.

It's science fiction storytelling from 2,000 years ago that people can't read right. People prize low-effort high-speed commenting networks, prize badness over goodness.

"Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would **become a trivial culture**, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on **the alert to oppose tyranny** "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”

It works. The denial of real reality, the denial of truth, here in the Reddit community. Tony Clifton acts draw in Reddit mocking every time. People eat it. And no President in USA history has ever had this much power, control and media coverage / media addicts. A population that will not stop prizing hate, prizing mockery, turning the whole nation into endless mocking FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS. Even when Trump was not POTUS for 4 years, he had a Reddit audience flock to every turd antic and behavior, unable to sse the compusive attraction to badness.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

Faith in fiction storytelling, monomyth science fiction, above nonfiction understanding and teaching. Social media society has abandoned serious learning in favor of entertainment-based antics. People are not asserting and teaching goodness like MLK Jr. did. People have given up the idea of better thinking systems than manipulation, marketing, deception, tricks, games, fiction storytelling. Fox News fiction addiction was an obvious problem people did not stand up to seriously. Neil Postman's 1985 book has been on the shelf eleven years before Fox News. Jen Senko's 2015 film came along to put nonfiction in front of the issue as a rally point, but people keep flocking to low-effort short-lived commenting. Anti-Wiki values of prizing high-speed recency over serious sutained focus (MLK Jr was about going to the past and plucking authentic cherries out of The Bible, cerry picking is GOODNESS. Not-picking Donald Trump to hate all day and night, to mock and insult, is not goodness).

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that **cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

Just like Donald Trump. If only people could see. Trump does not know WHY his organge makeup works on crowds, but it makes people abandon reason thnking and put their brain into "meme stupor" mode where all serious matters get washed away by mocking. He wins power and wealth, he doesn't know all the mechanics at a Neil Postman NYU level, but Trump knows it works. Reddit soceity does not see the forest for the trees that FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS that hate Trump, mock Trump, has only destroyed nonfiction and reason thinking.

Hence why I keep saying why does social media society avoid Malala. White skin color "right-wing" isn't the Taliban. Reddit community is extremely competitive on "smarter than you" egoism and anti-education anti-teaching that Malala supprots. Because education is seen as a way to dominate others, highly competitive to get name-brand university, etc. A big reason why sustained refined knowledge of Wiki systems is not prized on Reddit, because people view knowledge as a way to trick and outsmart peers / other people. There is extremely competitive egoism over calling people dumb / stupid / idiot / worthless. It is done CONSTANTLY to Donald J Trump / Mosk. People on Reddit prize celebration of ignroance, celebrating how dumb and stupid other people are. Sharing and making high-quality thoughtful learning a focus of every day in Wiki style is avoided to the extreme on Bluesky and Reddit culture.

Yes, like breaking the enviornment of planet earth. Like breaking human identity with Reddit accounts that hide identity. People only apply these thinking systems in romantic relationship contexts. Governments and jobs do not work if love and compassion and learning of goodness are not part of every area of society. Acting like toxic Reddit isn't toxic while discussing human relationship trajectories... forest for the trees. The entire planet, of over 8 billion people, is bombarding people with hate and dehumanization. Lust for technology and hate for persons. Filtering out "bad people" is avoiding the "bad environment" and bad culture and bad toxic outcomes of social media.

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1od4r54/did_kamala_really_lose_or_was_the_election_rigged/nkrchsw/

Yes. Including emotional and goodness supression. We are in the realm of toxic religions. Where love and compassion are abandoned every day all day. Terrorism and self-harm doesn't just go after governments. It is language itself, mindsets, etc. Cambridge Analytica depth charges into minds have damaged goodness, wrecked goodness. People who aren't standing up to all hate aren't seeing how it morphs and changes. The Surkov undfinable aspects that Adam Curtiis emphaized December 31, 2014. Hate is toxic, adding hate to every area of life makes everything supressive and shit. The 4 years WITHOUT Trump in White Hosue were still driven down by people prizing hate and not standing up to hate itself through education and teaching. Not by "cutting out" and thratening and starving people out of your life, cutting out MAGA. We have to rescue MAGA / rescue Trump / rescue people. The case has to be made for goodness, humanity is the source of goodness and source of love and compassion. Not outer space aliens ("Angels") sending magic messages down to Moses and Mohammad. We The People are the source of goodness.

Minds are broken. You can see everything Neil Postman wrote about in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" on Fox News, Bluesky, Reddit, Newsmax, Facebook, TikTok, etc, etc. This isn't "election rigging" in the way people are using the phrase. This is addiction to fiction. Self-harm fiction. A toxic set of fiction monomyth stories. Anti-nonfiction, people not facing up that school is not where adults learn. Video games, sports. church, Reddit, Netflix, Disney plus, etc is where adults learn. Fox News is where adults learn. Not in schools, education for adults is the crisis. Donald Trump trusts Putin because of media and communications as an adult, not because of his classroom education. Prizing low-effort disposable messages on Truth Social and Reddit is a crisis.

Trump is not stupid on media ecology. Including the postal mail paper media ecology. Reddit community is ignroant and uniformed of the emotional and behavior impacts of media. Trump is one of the smartest and most talented people in seeing media ecology influnce at the Marshall McLuhan, Andy Kaufman, Neil Postman, Surkov level. Calling people stupid is thought-terminating behavior. It ends conversation and does not educate or teach. It just encourages ending thought.

Yes, the denial of the year 2013 war against reality abounds. Facebook created what it "pretends", "just satire, bro", "just my sense of comedy,bro" pretends to be. Putin and Surkov for over 25 years. September 9, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - but people will no longer engage nonfiction learning.. The avoidance of nonfiction isn't "pretending", the addiction to low-effort disposable commenting as adult education isn't pretending. The Fox News audience addiction to "Amusing Ourselves To Death" (Neil Postman, 1985) isn't pretending. Quran science fiction monomyth audience isn't "pretending" to hand over power and wealth to the few since poetry was composed in year 635.

"But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable.

“Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of tribal institutions can return in the electric age, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.” - the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel.

Joke-washing, amusement-washing, entertainment-washing. Reddit audiences, Bluesky adueinces, people eat that shit up. Nonstop entertainment from an Entertainer President, Reality TV star. Media addicts flock.

Forgot Russia? Putin and Trump just met in Alaska this summer...

Luigi worshipers. People who will do ANYTHING to avoid nonfiction books on the problems.

Reddit audeinces have their minds blown. Constantly stimulated by the dialog and communications created by Kremlin and White House.

Extreme media addicts want even more fiction content. Never enough, for OVER TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS, always crying out for more ficiton, more Trump.

The next time a Reddit addict doesn't tak Marshall McLuhan media ecology seriously... the addiction to high-speed media to avoid comprehension. The Fox News problem, avoiding promoting Jen Senko's nonfiction film since year 2015....

Reddit community is in a simualcra. They can't imagine Tony Clifton **is acting this bad**. Possilbly **THE WORST** you have ever seen. https://youtu.be/JKTR8Yj5hg4?t=83 - Surkov won, Putin won. Americans will not engage nonriciton learning of Russian information warfare.

There is not a hint of **goodness** anymore. It's nonstop media addicts feeding their media addiction. Simualcra runaway, monomyth fiction runaway. Cambridge Analytica aftermath, minds avoidng GOODNESS at every level of society. MLK Jr's writings are right on WikiQuote, but people only want to react and insult Trump.

https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1oeepc5/trump_i_dont_think_were_gonna_necessarily_ask_for/nl13upv/

People are not sitting back, they are reacting. They are mocking. Their minds are in feedback loops. Hate leadership signals. Racing to high-speed TCP/IP media systems to hate Trump, blowing minds out. FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS chasing Donald Trump as entertainment, "LOL cow to milk for LOL memes".

https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1oeepc5/trump_i_dont_think_were_gonna_necessarily_ask_for/nl13zzx/

Popcorn entertainment, amusement comedy, surreal Surkovain governing. Nobody can stop it. Putin has been in power for over 25 years using popcorn audience techniques.

"I am a survivor of a concentration camp. My eyes saw what no person should witness. Gas chambers built by learned engineers. Children poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human."

You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis. We'll it's not working by osmosis!

It is a "win debate" and dehumanie tactic common on Reddit in year 2025.

And since July 2015, Donald Trump is the role model for parenting, business, children. Aspire to communicate and dominate like Trump.
