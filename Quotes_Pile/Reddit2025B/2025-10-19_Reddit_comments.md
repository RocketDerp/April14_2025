At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

"How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare"   
By Peter Pomerantsev. September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   
“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Ignorant reddit users who have not studied information warfare and media ecology. This is how the Kremlin and White House / Putin teams crawl inside opposition movements and render them absurd / surreal / everything becomes entertainment to Reddit audineces. Built upon reality, spike it with unreality LOL LMAO Tony Clifto bragging - and Reddit flocks to low-effort commenting mindsets. Nonfiction learning on what is happening is avoided at all costs to the future and children of the nation. The "Adults In The Room" flock to shit content on Bluesky and Reddit and won't stand up for media ecology teachng (nonfiction). Let's do the math here. The Republican party already "owns the conservatives" via Fox News HDTV, and now "owns the libs" via social media audiences, who is not owned? Owning EVERYONE. ... ... ...

“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”
