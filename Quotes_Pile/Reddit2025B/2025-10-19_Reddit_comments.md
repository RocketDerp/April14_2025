“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

“The other nine, decent, hard-working, ordinarily intelligent and honest men, did not know before 1933 that Nazism was evil. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil. And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45.

“The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jew swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45.

Mass Man (Marshall McLuhan Toronto terminology) / Mass Mind (Howard Bloom NYC term) vs. personal mind. Public dream vs. private dream. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

BILL MOYERS: Why is a myth different from a dream?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Oh, because a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and **a myth is the society’s dream. The myth is the public dream and the dream is the private myth.** If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn’t, you’ve got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you.

MOYERS: So if my private dreams are in accord with the public mythology, I’m more likely to live healthily in that society. But if my private dreams are out of step with the public —

CAMPBELL: — you’ll be in trouble. If you’re forced to live in that system, you’ll be a neurotic.

MOYERS: But aren’t many visionaries and even leaders and heroes close to the edge of neuroticism?

CAMPBELL: Yes, they are.

MOYERS: How do you explain that?

CAMPBELL: They’ve moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original experience has not been interpreted for you, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself in very difficult situations. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience — that is the hero’s deed.

MOYERS: You say dreams come up from the psyche.

CAMPBELL: I don’t know where else they come from. They come from the imagination, don’t they? The imagination is grounded in the energy of the organs of the body, and these are the same in all human beings. Since imagination comes out of one biological ground, it is bound to produce certain themes. Dreams are dreams. There are certain characteristics of dreams that can be enumerated, no matter who is dreaming them.

MOYERS: I think of a dream as something very private, while a myth is something very public.

CAMPBELL: On some levels a private dream runs into truly mythic themes and can’t be interpreted except by an analogy with a myth. Jung speaks of two orders of dream, the personal dream and the archetypal dream, or the dream of mythic dimension. You can interpret a personal dream by association, figuring out what it is talking about in your own life, or in relation to your own personal problem. But every now and then a dream comes up that is pure myth, that carries a mythic theme, or that is said, for example, to come from the Christ within.

MOYERS: From the archetypal person within us, the archetypal self we are.

CAMPBELL: That’s right.

Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**."

It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”

Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.

Reddit users claim to be smart, but never mount a rescue operation against the Cambridge Analytica mind-fuck. Taking Fox News seriously by promoting Jen Senko since year 2015 avoided. People are far too enaged in the CA / IRA conditioned out-group mocking. Mocking women, mocking nonfiction learning, mocking everyone else as *dumb stupid idiots* all the time. Egomania abounds. Why can't social media Bluesky and Reddit on Sunday (today) teach BIble verse "1 John 3:17" about Murdoch / Trump / Musk / Putin and stick to the topic of that teaching until every person in USA age 12 to age 120 knows that verse? Also "1 John 4:20"- confront and stand up to the clergy for not making these known with all the media venues and media oulets they have (Churches, television church shows / televagelism, advertising on Super Bowl in 2025 https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ad-meter/2025/02/09/he-gets-us-super-bowl-commercials-jesus/78249530007/ )

Fiction addicts abound. That it is "alternate universes" of storytelling and people can't translate Moses burning bush outer-space stories to Hamlet's Ghost and 1977 Star Wars "Force Ghost" stories. The Quran and Bible are SCIENCE FICTEN. Angels and dreams are creative storytelling. Messengers from outer space stories are crated every minute, ChatGPT can create 500 of them for you in an hour. The inability to translate outer-space "voices" / messages / Carl Sagan Contact / fiction stories between each other is a serious problem. Ahteists don't grasp their inability to translate The Bible to Star Wars. ... ... ...    
“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

Donald Trump goes on media systems, broadcasts images and words, and everyone flcoks. But people using media systems of social media can't seem to imagine stopping entertainment / stopping fiction video games / being serious and sustaining serious on important topics. To rescue MAGA from cults, intead of just commenting for year after year "cult" with no desire to rescue or turn the situation around using information systems. People aren't claling ofr mental health prfeesionals to deal with "mob mentality" issues, abandonment of science / reality-based thinking. People are behaving far more as addicts to having an out-gorup to "dunk upon" than actually any desire to assert goodness / originate goodness.

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

After 10 years and 3 months, still fixated on one and only one person. Reddit is a peer to peer hate platform, step out of line and you are blocked / attacked / downvoted / reported to secret police mods. I've documented some of my censored messages on this Github. People prize hate, they prize hate upon Trump, prize mocking upon Trump. It is a society that flocks to signals of total mockery and hate. It was not like this before year 2013. Cambridge Analytica and Internet Reserch Agency patterns have been adopted into routine everyday mindsets now. People are not standing up to hate itself and poor Bible literacy itself, they are mocking and insutling and commenting. Not seeing the forest for the trees.

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture **consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process**. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also **suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning**, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

Parenting in palestine is a fucking nightmare. Being born into that place with a passport that won't let you escape the out-group hate. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      
BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.
CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about.
