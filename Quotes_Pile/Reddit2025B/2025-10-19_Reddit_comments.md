“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45.

“The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jew swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45.

Mass Man (Marshall McLuhan Toronto terminology) / Mass Mind (Howard Bloom NYC term) vs. personal mind. Public dream vs. private dream. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

BILL MOYERS: Why is a myth different from a dream?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Oh, because a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and **a myth is the society’s dream. The myth is the public dream and the dream is the private myth.** If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn’t, you’ve got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you.

MOYERS: So if my private dreams are in accord with the public mythology, I’m more likely to live healthily in that society. But if my private dreams are out of step with the public —

CAMPBELL: — you’ll be in trouble. If you’re forced to live in that system, you’ll be a neurotic.

MOYERS: But aren’t many visionaries and even leaders and heroes close to the edge of neuroticism?

CAMPBELL: Yes, they are.

MOYERS: How do you explain that?

CAMPBELL: They’ve moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original experience has not been interpreted for you, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself in very difficult situations. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience — that is the hero’s deed.

MOYERS: You say dreams come up from the psyche.

CAMPBELL: I don’t know where else they come from. They come from the imagination, don’t they? The imagination is grounded in the energy of the organs of the body, and these are the same in all human beings. Since imagination comes out of one biological ground, it is bound to produce certain themes. Dreams are dreams. There are certain characteristics of dreams that can be enumerated, no matter who is dreaming them.

MOYERS: I think of a dream as something very private, while a myth is something very public.

CAMPBELL: On some levels a private dream runs into truly mythic themes and can’t be interpreted except by an analogy with a myth. Jung speaks of two orders of dream, the personal dream and the archetypal dream, or the dream of mythic dimension. You can interpret a personal dream by association, figuring out what it is talking about in your own life, or in relation to your own personal problem. But every now and then a dream comes up that is pure myth, that carries a mythic theme, or that is said, for example, to come from the Christ within.

MOYERS: From the archetypal person within us, the archetypal self we are.

CAMPBELL: That’s right.

Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the **Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion** than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**."

It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.”

Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,” David tells me.

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture **consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process**. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also **suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning**, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free.

I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show **entertains but does not inform**, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying **we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed**. Ignorance is always correctable.

Fiction addiction abounds. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" problem, people can't tell the character of God is a metaphor. Yaweh is an idea, a metaphor, a science fiction story character. People fall in love and fight wars for a metaphor / idea- and we don't chooseto teach that to everyone. We prefer to have predatory billionares make profit and power off it. Putin and Surkov monomyth self-harm on a massive scale apointing this. Death for a fiction story character. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...   

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It’s been said that poetry consists of letting the word be heard beyond words. And Goethe says, “All things are metaphors.” Everything that’s transitory is but a metaphorical reference. That’s what we all are.

BILL MOYERS: But how does one worship a metaphor, love a metaphor, die for a metaphor?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: **That’s what people are doing all over the place — dying for metaphors**. But when you really realize the sound, “AUM,” the sound of the mystery of the word everywhere, then you don’t have to go out and die for anything because it’s right there all around. Just sit still and see it and experience it and know it. That’s a peak experience.

It's science fiction storytelling from 2,000 years ago that people can't read right. People prize low-effort high-speed commenting networks, prize badness over goodness.

"Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would **become a trivial culture**, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on **the alert to oppose tyranny** "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”

It works. The denial of real reality, the denial of truth, here in the Reddit community. Tony Clifton acts draw in Reddit mocking every time. People eat it. And no President in USA history has ever had this much power, control and media coverage / media addicts. A population that will not stop prizing hate, prizing mockery, turning the whole nation into endless mocking FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS. Even when Trump was not POTUS for 4 years, he had a Reddit audience flock to every turd antic and behavior, unable to sse the compusive attraction to badness.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

Faith in fiction storytelling, monomyth science fiction, above nonfiction understanding and teaching. Social media society has abandoned serious learning in favor of entertainment-based antics. People are not asserting and teaching goodness like MLK Jr. did. People have given up the idea of better thinking systems than manipulation, marketing, deception, tricks, games, fiction storytelling. Fox News fiction addiction was an obvious problem people did not stand up to seriously. Neil Postman's 1985 book has been on the shelf eleven years before Fox News. Jen Senko's 2015 film came along to put nonfiction in front of the issue as a rally point, but people keep flocking to low-effort short-lived commenting. Anti-Wiki values of prizing high-speed recency over serious sutained focus (MLK Jr was about going to the past and plucking authentic cherries out of The Bible, cerry picking is GOODNESS. Not-picking Donald Trump to hate all day and night, to mock and insult, is not goodness).

“a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that **cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

Just like Donald Trump. If only people could see. Trump does not know WHY his organge makeup works on crowds, but it makes people abandon reason thnking and put their brain into "meme stupor" mode where all serious matters get washed away by mocking. He wins power and wealth, he doesn't know all the mechanics at a Neil Postman NYU level, but Trump knows it works. Reddit soceity does not see the forest for the trees that FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS that hate Trump, mock Trump, has only destroyed nonfiction and reason thinking.

Hence why I keep saying why does social media society avoid Malala. White skin color "right-wing" isn't the Taliban. Reddit community is extremely competitive on "smarter than you" egoism and anti-education anti-teaching that Malala supprots. Because education is seen as a way to dominate others, highly competitive to get name-brand university, etc. A big reason why sustained refined knowledge of Wiki systems is not prized on Reddit, because people view knowledge as a way to trick and outsmart peers / other people. There is extremely competitive egoism over calling people dumb / stupid / idiot / worthless. It is done CONSTANTLY to Donald J Trump / Mosk. People on Reddit prize celebration of ignroance, celebrating how dumb and stupid other people are. Sharing and making high-quality thoughtful learning a focus of every day in Wiki style is avoided to the extreme on Bluesky and Reddit culture.

Yes, like breaking the enviornment of planet earth. Like breaking human identity with Reddit accounts that hide identity. People only apply these thinking systems in romantic relationship contexts. Governments and jobs do not work if love and compassion and learning of goodness are not part of every area of society. Acting like toxic Reddit isn't toxic while discussing human relationship trajectories... forest for the trees. The entire planet, of over 8 billion people, is bombarding people with hate and dehumanization. Lust for technology and hate for persons. Filtering out "bad people" is avoiding the "bad environment" and bad culture and bad toxic outcomes of social media.

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1od4r54/did_kamala_really_lose_or_was_the_election_rigged/nkrchsw/

Yes. Including emotional and goodness supression. We are in the realm of toxic religions. Where love and compassion are abandoned every day all day. Terrorism and self-harm doesn't just go after governments. It is language itself, mindsets, etc. Cambridge Analytica depth charges into minds have damaged goodness, wrecked goodness. People who aren't standing up to all hate aren't seeing how it morphs and changes. The Surkov undfinable aspects that Adam Curtiis emphaized December 31, 2014. Hate is toxic, adding hate to every area of life makes everything supressive and shit. The 4 years WITHOUT Trump in White Hosue were still driven down by people prizing hate and not standing up to hate itself through education and teaching. Not by "cutting out" and thratening and starving people out of your life, cutting out MAGA. We have to rescue MAGA / rescue Trump / rescue people. The case has to be made for goodness, humanity is the source of goodness and source of love and compassion. Not outer space aliens ("Angels") sending magic messages down to Moses and Mohammad. We The People are the source of goodness.

Minds are broken. You can see everything Neil Postman wrote about in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" on Fox News, Bluesky, Reddit, Newsmax, Facebook, TikTok, etc, etc. This isn't "election rigging" in the way people are using the phrase. This is addiction to fiction. Self-harm fiction. A toxic set of fiction monomyth stories. Anti-nonfiction, people not facing up that school is not where adults learn. Video games, sports. church, Reddit, Netflix, Disney plus, etc is where adults learn. Fox News is where adults learn. Not in schools, education for adults is the crisis. Donald Trump trusts Putin because of media and communications as an adult, not because of his classroom education. Prizing low-effort disposable messages on Truth Social and Reddit is a crisis.

Trump is not stupid on media ecology. Including the postal mail paper media ecology. Reddit community is ignroant and uniformed of the emotional and behavior impacts of media. Trump is one of the smartest and most talented people in seeing media ecology influnce at the Marshall McLuhan, Andy Kaufman, Neil Postman, Surkov level. Calling people stupid is thought-terminating behavior. It ends conversation and does not educate or teach. It just encourages ending thought.

Yes, the denial of the year 2013 war against reality abounds. Facebook created what it "pretends", "just satire, bro", "just my sense of comedy,bro" pretends to be. Putin and Surkov for over 25 years. September 9, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - but people will no longer engage nonfiction learning.. The avoidance of nonfiction isn't "pretending", the addiction to low-effort disposable commenting as adult education isn't pretending. The Fox News audience addiction to "Amusing Ourselves To Death" (Neil Postman, 1985) isn't pretending. Quran science fiction monomyth audience isn't "pretending" to hand over power and wealth to the few since poetry was composed in year 635.

"But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable.

“Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of tribal institutions can return in the electric age, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.” - the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel.

"I am a survivor of a concentration camp. My eyes saw what no person should witness. Gas chambers built by learned engineers. Children poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human."

You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis. We'll it's not working by osmosis!

"the stage is constantly changing: the country is a dictatorship in the morning, a democracy at lunch, an oligarchy by suppertime, while, backstage, oil companies are expropriated, journalists killed, billions siphoned away. Surkov is at the centre of the show, sponsoring nationalist skinheads one moment, backing human rights groups the next. It’s a strategy of power based on keeping any opposition there may be constantly confused, a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it’s indefinable.

This fusion of despotism and postmodernism, in which no truth is certain, is reflected in the craze among the Russian elite for neuro-linguistic programming and Eriksonian hypnosis: types of subliminal manipulation based largely on confusing your opponent, first developed in the US in the 1960s. There are countless NLP and Eriksonian training centres in Moscow, with every wannabe power-wielder shelling out thousands of dollars to learn how to be the next master manipulator. Newly translated postmodernist texts give philosophical weight to the Surkovian power model. François Lyotard, the French theoretician of postmodernism, began to be translated in Russia only towards the end of the 1990s, at exactly the time Surkov joined the government. The author of Almost Zero loves to invoke such Lyotardian concepts as the breakdown of grand cultural narratives and the fragmentation of truth: ideas that still sound quite fresh in Russia." - October 20, 2011 - https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

1993 Rick Roderick: "And the charm of Rorty’s answer is it’s so American. It’s deeply rooted in our culture, in both **the anti-intellectualism of our culture, in our fear of eggheads** and so on, and so in that sense it has a double significance. Positively it means that the work of intellectuals has always been separated off from the work of ordinary people. In other words, you have to be freed from the constraints of manual labour. When I was a dishwasher, I didn’t have a lot of time to do this. When I was a union organiser, I didn’t have a lot of time to do this. Any time I was involved in manual labour, I didn’t really have the time to do this intellectual work. That separation, that fateful separation between intellectual and manual labour has been with philosophy throughout. It’s rather disappointing though to have that tradition – the great tradition of thinking in general – be reduced to a comment like “Well, gee… I don’t care.

"In contrast to the Oriental (Buddhist and Vedantic) ways of interpreting the symbolism of the guarded gate and passage to the Tree of Life — as referring, namely, to an inward, psychological, barrier and crisis of transcendence — the authorized Christian reading has been of an actual, concrete, historic event of atonement with an angry god, who for centuries had withheld his boon of paradise from mankind, until strangely reconciled by this curious self-giving of his only son to a criminal’s death on the Cross. The fact of the crucifixion was **read as the central fact of all history, and along with it certain other associated “facts” were accepted**, such as in other mythological traditions would be interpreted psychologically (or, as theologians say, “spiritually”) as symbols; such as (1) the Virgin Birth, (2) the Resurrection, (3) the Ascension, (4) the existence of a heaven to which a physical body might ascend, and, of course, (5) the Fall in the garden of Eden, c. 4004 B.C., from the guilt of which the Crucifixion has redeemed us." https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

Left-right one-bit brainrot. The window of prized behavior has moved to: fiction over nonfiction. Badness prized, goodness avoided. Machine lust - touch device machines, entertainment movie-making and TV making machines (Star Wars Andor content creation machines)... anti-humanism. Anti-Wiki refinement of understanding, scattered filter-bubble. Every person in thier own club of tribal thinking. Logic reactionary mindsets. That is the why the "War On Woke". But it isn't the shallow woke people think in their framented view of "Wake" / "Woke" / "Wokeness". The woke of media ecology, Fox News woke, Internet Reserach Agency media woke, Reddit invasion by IRA woke. "Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce from year 1924 onward. March 1967, decades after the 1924 onward publication of Wake... Canadian Professor / University of Tronto spelled out what to *keep the eye on*, eye on the media systems / society change ball. Woke. ... ... ...        

“Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of **tribal institutions can return in the electric age**, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.” - the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel. It was published in March 1967 https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/

"The left" one-bit brain-rot. Donald Trump made **orange skin color, orange race** a topic for constant entertainment and amusement. Making brown / white / black skin colors a constant topic. He knows people don't like his orange color, he isn't deaf and dumb to how people talk about his orange skin. It's Tony Clifton performance, it blows the minds of Bluesky audience and Reddit audience into skin color meme-think. Blows minds into meme stupors, LOL LOL "milking the LOL cow for jokes and memes" - endless prizing of Donald Trump as a joke source. A source of amusement and entertainment. Low-effort commenting addicts / media addicts are thrilled to have entertainment leaders. In this following quote, [Howdy Doody fiction clown show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody) is President Ronald Regan in year 1985 of book publication, second term in office / White House. ... ... ...   
"All that has happened is that the public has **adjusted to incoherence** and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the **Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion** than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**

Any hate can be justified if wrapped in fiction. Surkov governing / information warfare. Programming minds with fiction, bring in Cambridge Analytica doctors, wreck the whole human race. Because no law is going to stop people from supporting fiction. Factual history is the reason for the 1954 equation. Turning entertainment TV into meme-washing of real-world problems is themost powerful self-harm humanity has created. Hate itself is the problem.

Russia's IRA and CA drove people into self-harm. At best, many people will try not to actively harm others.  A society where 1 in 10 are predatory who prize 20 kills each doesn't take long to turn all life into hell. Let alone wiht 3 out of 10 prize 25 kill each. People fell in love with IRA memes and machines. A person can't compete with fiction fantasy outselling a real human person. "Not good enough" Bernie Sanders ideas in 2025, not good enough Malala since year 2013. A planet of 8 billion people and people do not cherry-pick cheries, people since year 2013 prize hate and predatory agressive programming of billlonaires to self-harm. People can't even accept a natural cherry, a real human person, too many augmented clothing / makeup actors and sports stars too choose from. Always another star to fill the mind with.

Russia is self-harming at Surkov monomyth, Israel is self-harming. Faith in Eden as a literal reward is self-harm to Earth, condemnation of life on Earth as a wrecking ground of conquest.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but **with the planet**. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

Canada is not playing dirty. People on Reddit have their minds blow that language is being rewritten right in front of them. That Reddit audience has adopted the hate and dehumanization of Trump leadership. ... ... ...     
"the stage is constantly changing: the country is a dictatorship in the morning, a democracy at lunch, an oligarchy by suppertime, while, backstage, oil companies are expropriated, journalists killed, billions siphoned away. Surkov is at the centre of the show, sponsoring nationalist skinheads one moment, backing human rights groups the next. It’s a strategy of power based on keeping any opposition there may be constantly confused, a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it’s indefinable.

This fusion of despotism and postmodernism, in which no truth is certain, is reflected in the craze among the Russian elite for neuro-linguistic programming and Eriksonian hypnosis: types of subliminal manipulation based largely on confusing your opponent, first developed in the US in the 1960s. There are countless NLP and Eriksonian training centres in Moscow, with every wannabe power-wielder shelling out thousands of dollars to learn how to be the next master manipulator. Newly translated postmodernist texts give philosophical weight to the Surkovian power model. François Lyotard, the French theoretician of postmodernism, began to be translated in Russia only towards the end of the 1990s, at exactly the time Surkov joined the government. The author of Almost Zero loves to invoke such Lyotardian concepts as the breakdown of grand cultural narratives and the fragmentation of truth: ideas that still sound quite fresh in Russia." - October 20, 2011 - https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

Yes, of the influence of tiny-short messages. The most popular comment on this posting. The behavior is egoism, egomania. Self-centered because of followers feedback. You see this with online sex workers who do camera recording in public places as "risk taking". Donald Trump is the role model of the world of media star. Everything is a stage, and people are thrilled to hate upon the Tony Clifton confidence.

Every area of our life is driven by marketing and advertising techniques. It's ok if a billionaire funds Reddit with advertising and marketing methods, but once a everyday person does it - people act like it is a problem. The billionars are wrecking the USA ana threatening the world with war. Nobody wants to roganize and stand up to the problem being role models of success.

She is commenting about hte concern on video.. how is a Reddit comment creator commenting about a stranger's concert attendance being "in the moment" of their life when it isn't a live photograph and posted the next day? This is "business as usual" in a world where billionares are wrecking society with all their power and wealth while people do thier bread and circus at concerts and on Reddit.

The priority of the things. Every day low-effort reactions instead of begging people to do what beggers need. Housing, education, goodness, food, etc. Entertainment of concert, entertainment of insulting a entertainer content creator, on and on. The world of over 8 billion people has come together to ignore leaders like Malala and not actually desire goodness. Let it be known, this is what peole with free time and spare time prized and made priority.

Media addiction, Reddit. Let it be known: people don't want goodness, they want a Reality TV star of "The Apprentice" to direct them around instead of finding better values from the public library of information. Same with Luigi worship on social media since December 4, 2024. Instead of saying: no murder is bad, We, We The PEOPLE, need to make the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights a sustained topic - Lugi the killer is the sustained cheering on. Gun worship, snaeak attack, manipulator who prizes high rent prices and real estate golf course families. Pay $8,500 more a moth for rent - but $1 a month for health care - btecause it's too much for people to focus on the inter-connected issues of food / housing / hehatlh care / education - all in the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights. It isn't even a LONG list. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights - but the prioirty is music concert and Luigi getting hot sex for being a gun worshiper who does manipulation and sneak attacks with extensive planning. Because no amount of extensive planning or spending moeny seems to get January 1944 Second Bill of Rights on the public table of discussion. Only negative things like murder and gun worship (Luigi) get you on the front page of society toic, or holding a selfi-light in the middle of a concert gets you on the public topic for a brief period. Or be like Donald Trump and Putin, do terrible things every 6 hours of evey day for OVER TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS - and get on the front page. But don't address GLOBAL PROBELMS like Malala was doing in January 2009 - education for millions of people being trampled on by shit values of society and toxic interpretaitons of Levant religions - and sustain. Cheering on Lugii the sneak attack manipulative murderer is what gets attention and sustained focus all year in 2025. And my "rambling" long-form writing isn't going to get the point acorss.

The world does revolve around you. But Star Wars fan's can not be bothered with the NONFICTION learning. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

MOYERS: What happens when a society no longer embraces a powerful mythology?

CAMPBELL: What we’ve got on our hands. If you want to find out what it means to have a society without any rituals, read the New York Times.

MOYERS: And you’d find?

CAMPBELL: The news of the day, including destructive and violent acts by young people who don’t know how to behave in a civilized society.

MOYERS: Society has provided them no rituals by which they become members of the tribe, of the community. All children need to be twice born, to learn to function rationally in the present world, leaving childhood behind. I think of that passage in the first book of Corinthians: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”

CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it. That’s the significance of the puberty rites. In primal societies, there are teeth knocked out, there are scarifications, there are circumcisions, there are all kinds of things done. So you don’t have your little baby body anymore, you’re something else entirely.

...

ROUNDSPARROW: And marketing and advertising does that in our society. We don''t need physical violence. We need to lean and understand EVERY aspect of society, including where to look for NON-popularity. Not upvoting on Reddit. We don't need parents and government to knock teeth out and cut the penis and bomb Swat Valley schools. We need to stop acting like we are ignorant.

...

MOYERS: What has undercut this experience today?

CAMPBELL: It’s characteristic of democracy that majority rule is understood as being effective not only in politics but also in thinking. **In thinking, of course, the majority is always wrong.**

MOYERS: Always wrong?

CAMPBELL: In matters of this kind, yes. The majority’s function in relation to the spirit is to try to listen and to open up to someone who’s had an experience

...

ROUNDSPARROW: Malala in the case of January 2009 onward with her blog. If you can't see the crisis of September 11, 2001 terrorism and the education focus answer of January 2009 blog (less than a decade later)... and Roger Ebert's June 2010 war against the Taliban statement: https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/restrepo-2010 "It raises for me an obvious question: How can this war possibly be won? At the end, a title tells us U.S. troops withdrew from the Korangal Valley and therefore Outpost Restrepo in 2010."

It isn't even that. it is what are we teaching? If we can not convince ourelves like Woodstock 1969 that peace and goodness is worth drug overdosing, death for, the pain and suffering of facing egoism / egomania in society - then what is a good death? Malala stood up for a good death. Standing up for wealth lords and power concentration has been popular, people standing up for Donald Trump since June 16, 2015 - standing up for out-group hate of immigrants and hate all around. If we can't make the case for heaen on earth, we won't build it and we will attack it.

What fucking concept do you have of "normal realionship" and "normalcy" to not see the role models for these 30 year old streamers? Since age 20, for a decade, they have been bombarded with role model and idol and god-figure of Donald Trump and Putin as "normal".

What's broken is the abandonment of nonfiction. Year 1995, spelled out. ... ... ...         

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

This is about fiction vs. nonfiction. It is a loophole that people can do ANYTHING as depicted in fiction. Star Wars Andor is about terrorism being cool, that words and ideas can't solve problems, violence and secret communications solve problems. Not that people choose goodness, but that there is forever a fight btween dark and light and keep on fighting forever and forever and forever as weapon systems can evolve to destroy entire planets and never face up that all hate is band and stop educating that evil / dark side is a valid choice.

People want an out-group, a Trump to hate. You don't have to hate Trump to remove Trump as a leader. There are plenty of other people that aren't elevated to leaders / POTUS. The hate itself is what attractw people to Trump. Hate upon a Tony Clifton performance is not resisting a Tony Clifton performance.  We ALL need to be [asserting and repeating The 1954 Equation.](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md)- it is the very meaning of "common good", "common goodness".

“If we could learn to look instead of gawking,    
We'd see the horror in the heart of farce,    
If only we could act instead of talking,    
We wouldn't always end up on our arse.   
This was the thing that nearly had us mastered;   
Don't yet rejoice in his defeat, you men!   
Although the world stood up and stopped the bastard,   
The bitch that bore him is in heat again.”

Year 1985: “What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.”

Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the **power of the market** simultaneously, they may **keep the common man in eternal subjection**.” - April 9, 1944

At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

A good educaiton system would have you criticizing a media society that prizes: 1) high speed TCP/IP above all else, 2) low-effort message commenting, 3) disposable messages, 4) avoids Wiki style refined "getting ot he same page" of serious topics. 5) avoids author names, real names, avoids quotes, avoids links. Bluesky and Reddit society. A educaiton on media ecology would call out the 10-second sound bites culture of meme life / Reddit. ... ... ...       
"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

USA thinks that in year 2015 things were horrible and terrible and non-entertainment leaders were boring and not good enough. And that a "wrecking ball" against of adding MORE AND MORE amusements and entertainment, to make Reddit behaviors EVERY AREA of society, to embrace and welcome Surkov governing / Internet Research Agency since yera 2013 was a good idea. A spoiled nation that was prizing media addicts as leaders, entertainment above all else, had it bad. Addicts to memes and high speed junk messages wanting constant stimualtion from a billionare of MORE MORE entertainment, ALL THE TIME amusement. That this 'wrecking ball" wasn't an addicts society diving into widespread meme addictions. Diving into the Russian information warfare. Low-effort commenting addicts / media addicts are thrilled to have entertainment leaders.

"All that has happened is that the public has **adjusted to incoherence** and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the **Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion** than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**."

Reddit is full of messages encouraging revenge-lust, Luigi revenge against a CEO since Decemer 4, 2024. Payback to MAGA, *leopards better fucking eat your face* messages, you deseve hate, prizing of hate, prizing of dehumanization. Prizing of payback and revenge. People death-wishing Trump constantly.

Just like Middle East haate vs. hate out-group patterns. ... ... ...       
"What Cambridge Analytica observed was that when respondents were **angry**, their *need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced*. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were **more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups**. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, **people primed with anger** would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.”

And what, Fox News audience has critical thinking skills? And that phrase has become practicaly thought-terminating. People throw it around like it has a common and understood meaning. "Critical thinking" will solve our issues. How about citing author names? book titles? This problem is not only on Reddit. It is also on Bluesky, it is also on HDTV network audiences. All high-speed media systems. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" needs to be understood by every person age 12 to age 120 and applied to Russian Surkov information warfare since year 2013. The Pentagon and White House are not Reddit, the problem is every area of society. ... ... ...      
“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.
