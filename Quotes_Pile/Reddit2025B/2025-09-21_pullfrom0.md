Social media comment community on evrey site I find downplays MAGA and Trump by amusment-washing,humor-washing,entertainment-washing the situation. Commenting as if it is sports game and not wrecking the future with sustained patternsof self-harm values and behaviors.

Hundeds of millions of people who have put Trump the center of all USA language and dialog do not have dementia. People are in deep denial of the mass pschosis and ignorant of mass mind / mob mentality / group-thinking disorders.

People in USA find it so funny, laughing away, entertained that Russia information warfare since year 2013 has people livng in anti-reality / alternate-reality mindsets. Endlessly commenting millions and millions of social machine comments expressing how engaging the past 10 plus years have been with Donald Trump the center of langauge and conversations.

Denial abounds. Remarks of "what happened to this country?" can't be tied to Februarh 2014 start of Ukraine War and the online Reddit informaiton warfare / Twitter information warfae from Russia from March 2013 onward. Anti-reality / anti-science. People can not face up to factual evidence: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

Fandom to entertainment systems unable to cite nonficton about Russian governing systems that created the Putin Russian we have today. https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250831-the-wizard-of-the-kremlin-the-new-film-about-how-putins-russia-was-born

You see so few people discussing Found Fathers and ideals / thinking systems. The Enlightment time period and the mindsets. Left vs. Right is so core to social media thinking. The Constitution and Decleration of Independence doesn't frame things in left vs. right, but media systems (Reddit inclusive) onstantly refrence this logic. People behave like it is a team sport thoughtlessly, compusive out-group framing. We The People can't seem to think in terms of mutliple good ideas and having to debate between choices of good progress. Instead of bad ideas being treated like an option and valid path.

THinks this is domestic only and not able to name drop any author, book titles, nonfiction. Just comment after comment with free time and spare time, no desire to use said free time to be serious about improtant topics. Such as learning how Russia information warfare and population / society is held down by Putin's Kremlin. Fixated that *one person* is all that matters, one single brain, and not the shift to Russian style tactics that are done by groups of people, including Elon Musk.

Just one person living in alternate reality is all Reddit community can fixate on. What about Fox News audience, they all old men age 79? What about MAGA group? What about the people leading Texas, Flordia - all old 79 year age men? This is a denial byt fixation on Trump that doesn't see the forest for the trees. Mutlple nations are reporting Russian information warfare against reality. Anti-science is anti-reality. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

It is a conditioned alternate reality. Russian mental manipulation wasn't just Republicans and MAGA. A charachteristic is attraction to self-harm by mockery and hate messaging. Hate Trump / Mock Trump / join in the Toatl Mockery. As if there are not enough entertainment and sports option in USA, not it has to be every media system covering the White House and Kremlin paired antics and mass dehumaniation. Addiction exploits in the human mind to fiction are outcomes of the Cambridge Analytica and Russian information patterns.

Street gangs of symbolism systems, science fiction Bible vs. Quran vs. Torah - long tradition of media venue audience vs. media venue audience (Mosque vs. Church, etc).

What exactly does the word "Poltical" mean to people? Campaigning, fishing for men? Bible verse Matthew 4:19 - Judgement Day - jduging people, Jesus job? Revelation 20:11-15 - is the Quran political? But the Bible is not? Are conflicts between Quran and Bible political? Qur'an, specifically the opening chapter, Al-Fatihah, verse 1:4. The Arabic phrase for this is "Māliki yawmiddīn" (مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ), which translates to "Master of the Day of Judgment" or "Master of the Time of Judgement".

An audience on the edge of their seat around everything related to Donald Trump. Addiction to antics and enteratinment Reality TV stars and behaviors.

Same with dumb or mentally damaged / mental disorder people. They aren't all egomaniacs with endless greed and desire to dominate the world. Clever intelligence used to harm others is not that hard to witness.
