You see so few people discussing Found Fathers and ideals / thinking systems. The Enlightment time period and the mindsets. Left vs. Right is so core to social media thinking. The Constitution and Decleration of Independence doesn't frame things in left vs. right, but media systems (Reddit inclusive) onstantly refrence this logic. People behave like it is a team sport thoughtlessly, compusive out-group framing. We The People can't seem to think in terms of mutliple good ideas and having to debate between choices of good progress. Instead of bad ideas being treated like an option and valid path.

Hate Trump / Mock Trump / join in the Toatl Mockery.

Lee, a forensic psychiatrist, containing essays from 27 psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dangerous_Case_of_Donald_Trump - also pushing that the ONLYU THING possible to fix problems is one single election day, voting. And compeltely avoiding other nonfiction topics such as Russia / Putin relationship despite even recent visit with Trump and Putin in Alaska. Why can people every 12 hours on Reddit post and assert Dr. Bandy X. Lee education to the public about the situation? Instead of just commenting describing how nothing can change the situation but voting. When people are following self-harm, voting is going to mean more self-harm leaders like Trump. We need to address the comrpehension and understanding of self-harm / mob mentality itself.

The discussions **consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for**, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one.

No citations, no book reference, no author reference, etc. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― [Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md), page 85. **year 2019**

Reddit and Bluesky are clubs of Hate Trump / Mock Trump, constantly teaching that more hate and mocking and insulting is good.

"and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45. Published 1955.

The discussions **consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for**, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one. At this point, some Americans speak English; others speak Fox." https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/

Why do people think it is only 75 million people that Trump hates? People are convinced MAGA children and rural farmers are being loved by having their heatlh care taken away and having the enviornment wrecked by potrol worship and pollution? People are so conditioned to think Trump is a symbol of love when time and itme again it is self-harm to humanity that is demonstrated. USA is being harmed, even Texas, even Florida, is being harmed by Trump. It isn't a subset.

The shooting was captured by 3,000 live audience members with high-speed media networks and camera devices. The killing of Charlie Kirk was dramatic gun. This is Utah, a gun-worship society driven by science fiction Mormon Bible retcon. Action violence draws a lot of image sharing of a dramatic murder. Killing excites people. Media addiction / addiciton to Reality TV is the basis of Donald Trump's power. Donald Trump is constantly shared on the front page of Reddit, trending on Bluesky, all over Twitter, on evey media system and media network - TRUMP content. Charlie Kirk was part of those media influencers / media networks. Turming Point USA was a media empire appealing to media addicts / fiction addicts (Bible is fiction, Truth Social is fiction). The rifle shooting of Kirk was like cinema / movie to people who saw all the angles captured by all those cameras. It was a media addict content event. Filmed in good lighting, on a stage. People care about images and media content, dehumanizing people in USA who aren't attractive or creating exciting content. That's what the Trump / MAGA movement is all about. Live being Fox Sports / Fox News Entertainment / Reddit amusement entertainment and memes. Being super-reduddant.

This is a failure of comrephension. Trump is VERY concerned about the population of the USA. Very converned, giving a shit, about 340 million people. He wants to self-harm them, as condtioned by Putin / Russia to wreck the USA. This is a murder-suicide of future / children / nature and Earth itself. Donald Trump is working incredibly hard, giving a shit, very motivated. Amazing how much this 79 year old man is working his ass off to promote badness itself, self-harm values.

Choice marriage honesty is a huge learning ground I've been covering on Bluesky hashtags. Even extremely gifted communicators such as book authors / songwriters / musicans / actors have marriage problems. Because of their wealth and fame, ultimatly they often can't hide their child custody battles and time apart. Even with beauty, wealth, fame, social power, multiple houses... they find compassion and love, communications within marriage broken. Many write songs sharing the conflicts, make films with lessons, write books about it. Katy Perry being an example about her marriage failures. Katy Perry can communicate with millons, yet she reveals how intimate communictions breakdown and choice marriage honesty is still as difficult as it can be for non-famous people all over the world. Wealth and power don't make these problems any easier, doespite so many people who have faith that wealth would address love issues and Tower of Babel metaphor problems.

Funeral Wake (Finnegans Wake). Death and sex are tied together in the human mind. We really need to be teaching **comparative mythology** to ever person age 12 to age 120, as part of NATO mental defense against Russian mind-fucking..  and self-awareness in general. Joseph Campbell, Skywalker Ranch lessons filmed by George Lucas in Power of Myth book: "It’s amazing: one after another, you discover these gods who are at once of death and of generation. The death god, Ghede, of the Haitian Voodoo tradition, is also the sex god. The Egyptian god Osiris was the judge and lord of the dead, and the lord of the regeneration of life. It is a basic theme—that which dies is born. You have to have death in order to have life."

I've worked in client/server app development on the server-side since 1984... Grindr isn't a resource-intensive app. The face they have a reputation for crashing year after year after year is either being used as a markeeting legend / street credibility factor... or they have really failed to organize "call to arms" for usres to test-load the app or even build a testing feature into the app to simulate heavy load...or even scripting some load simualtors. Anyway, messaging apps like Bluesky and Reddit have the same basic design issues as Grindr.

Malala from Swat Valley Pakistah. ... ... ... “I started thinking about that, and I used to think that the Talib would come, and he would just kill me. But then I said, ‘If he comes, what would you do Malala?’ then I would reply to myself, ‘Malala, just take a shoe and hit him.’ But then I said, ‘If you hit a Talib with your shoe, then there would be no difference between you and the Talib. You must not treat others with cruelty and that much harshly, you must fight others but through peace and through dialogue and through education.’Then I said I will tell him how important education is and that ‘I even want education for your children as well.’ And I will tell him, ‘That’s what I want to tell you, now do what you want.” ― Malala Yousafzai on a late-night show with John Stewart. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjGL6YY6oMs

Why is Bible science fiction so poorly misundestood. Celebration of death is the very foundation of Jesus on the cross, the cross symbol. ... ... ... Joseph Campbell, Skywalker Ranch lessons filmed by George Lucas in Power of Myth book: "Of course, the whole story of the crucifixion, which is a fundamental image in the Christian tradition, speaks of the coming of eternity into the field of time and space, where there is dismemberment. But it also speaks of the passage from the field of time and space into the field of eternal life. So we crucify our temporal and earthly bodies, let them be torn, and through that dismemberment enter the spiritual sphere which transcends all the pains of earth. There’s a form of the crucifix known as “Christ Triumphant,” where he is not with head bowed and blood pouring from him, but with head erect and eyes open, as though having come voluntarily to the crucifixion. St. Augustine has written somewhere that Jesus went to the cross as a bride-groom to his bride."
