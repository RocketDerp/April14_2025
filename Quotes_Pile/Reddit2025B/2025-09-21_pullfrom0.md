You see so few people discussing Found Fathers and ideals / thinking systems. The Enlightment time period and the mindsets. Left vs. Right is so core to social media thinking. The Constitution and Decleration of Independence doesn't frame things in left vs. right, but media systems (Reddit inclusive) onstantly refrence this logic. People behave like it is a team sport thoughtlessly, compusive out-group framing. We The People can't seem to think in terms of mutliple good ideas and having to debate between choices of good progress. Instead of bad ideas being treated like an option and valid path.

Hate Trump / Mock Trump / join in the Toatl Mockery.

Lee, a forensic psychiatrist, containing essays from 27 psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dangerous_Case_of_Donald_Trump - also pushing that the ONLYU THING possible to fix problems is one single election day, voting. And compeltely avoiding other nonfiction topics such as Russia / Putin relationship despite even recent visit with Trump and Putin in Alaska. Why can people every 12 hours on Reddit post and assert Dr. Bandy X. Lee education to the public about the situation? Instead of just commenting describing how nothing can change the situation but voting. When people are following self-harm, voting is going to mean more self-harm leaders like Trump. We need to address the comrpehension and understanding of self-harm / mob mentality itself.

The discussions **consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for**, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one.

Short Twiter-length Tweet-thinking messaging. No citations, no book reference, no author reference, etc. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13. ... ... ... “If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― [Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md), page 85. **year 2019**

Blasphomy against science fiction Bible storytelling and Quran science fiction storytelling is a known mind exploit. Addicts to fiction can go into egomania and want to shut down and kill those that offer scientific interpretations of the world, fact-based evidence-based thinking.
