1. I quote Martin Luther King Jr during Christmas season December 2025. Try to assert context outside of 2025 MAGA USA Reddit high-speed reactionary hive mind media environment. See the reply I get.

2. The commenting context is Vince Gilligan's television show "Pluribus". What Vince Gilligan said on February 15, 2025 this year about Reddit and other social media users: "there's no simple answer for how we might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other" https://youtu.be/TkteSxVIM1A?t=648

3. Person chazzer20mystic completely against the idea of hive mind mental equality of the Founding Fathers being taken seriously, the Latin motto of the real nation United States of America.

4. chazzer20mystic views mental disorders and stress living under Donald Trump all year 2025, MAGA nation, as a weakness to attack in public with Reddit's powerful computer machines.

5. chazzer20mystic is a 9+ year Reddit account (July 12, 2016). Very territorial. Breaking Bad fandom? Saul manipulative lawyers fandom?

6. "mystic" in their username, but anti-mystic on neurodiversity / mind peering of free-thinking individuals.

7. Hides their Reddit profile history despite 9+ year account history. Very suspicious on Reddit. This new enshitification 2025 feature wasn't available 9 years ago. see: https://old.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1nrzzkm/how_long_has_reddit_had_the_feature_that_enables/ "Plus, the ability to look at someone's post and comment history was a big advantage in a debate because you could use something they said against them with an undeniable proof. Also, when I first joined the site, learning about the fact that you cannot make your post and comment history private stood to me as one of the defining features of Reddit — it was something that I really liked. With the ability to hide one's post and comment history, I believe there will be a huge influx of bots and karma farmers on all the big subs due to the leeway they get to post anything without any consequences."

8. When chazzer20mystic is asked directly to provide evidence of their public claims "What hostility? Quote it? You can't read tone and body language, eh?" - the reply ignores the question and attacks again.

9. No Reddit bystanders intervene and call out that chazzer20mystic is attacking a person for their use of English writing in public, a personal attack, and not discussing the public topic of the Apple TV+ show "Pluribus" (which even the message with my MLK Jr quote is in the themes of a USA hive mind programming / Christian hive mind values)

USA MAGA 2025 Reddit society / Trump Truth Social values on Reddit / immigration ICE lives billionaire-funded inside Reddit audiences heads. Hate thy neighbor, hate thy enemy. Anti love. The 1954 Equation posting in December 2025 people can't even see how much USA society is being lead by a President / POTUS of "Pluribus" that is a hate-nation Truth Social leadership.

&nbsp;

A big reason I witnessing these "bot", "you had a stroke" kind of Reddit behaviors *as bullshit* (bad) behaviors:

Since the IRA invasion of year 2013 onward, people don't say the most obvious and common examples: Are you tired, lack of sleep. Distracted by a song on the radio or talking to another person while writing a message on Reddit. Things I have experienced with people my entire life. Writing while on an airplane. Parenting a child. 

The competitive *hate harder* contest of social media is a big part of Vince Gilligan's WGA February 15, 2025 call-out. The high-speed loss of personal identity (of everyone) that Marshall McLuhan described in 1977. https://www.organism.earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus "Everybody tends to merge his identity with other people at the speed of light. It’s called being mass man. It began quite a long time ago."

Vince Gilligan said it was "not his wheelhouse", but it became mine December 16, 2009 with the Internet Arab Spring and my travel to Algeria in Africa to study media ecology. And Malala's January 3, 20009 blogging from Swat Valley, Pakistan.  The hate people have over September 11, 2001 religion science fiction (Pluribus is science fiction) storytelling observations and interpretations.
