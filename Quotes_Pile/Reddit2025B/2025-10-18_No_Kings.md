Motivated by hate. A core focus of this GitHub project. How everything centered around Putin and Trump's use of Surkov student techniques is hate-driven. Out-group hate. "Liberal tears", feeding the flames. Hate itself is the problem. We ALL need to be [asserting and repeating The 1954 Equation.](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md)

This is assserting goodness. Standing up for something good. Instead of standing up to pour more hate into a hate-driven machine mindsets that Russia cultivated since year 2013.

Levant Mythology of "Hell" underground, fiction. Anti forgiveness. We can impeach him if we all get on same page of goodness. Romans 11:32 - there is no hell. Study year 1924 onwaard Finnegans Wake.

Wow. Yes. Summer of 1987, age 83. JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It’s primarily a spiritual exercise, and the society is supposed to help us have the realization. Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of man. When man is in the service of society, you have a monster state, and that’s what is threatening the world at this minute.

Sports mentality, team sports, USA city vs. USA city. People are not seeing hate of people in groups, mob mentality, out-group hate patterns. Martin Luther King Jr's teachings have been abandoned / wrecked by Russian IRA and CA.

The values prized of a 79 year old shit leader of a shit-prizing population.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Superficial and shallow, cosmetic Tony Clifton works on people. People have their minds so blown by oragnge skin makeup, the audience reacts so much to it, for over TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS, that people can't imagine that that's the very brain exploit. That Surkovian government is based on finding what the audience will prize that is negative. Skin color hate, clothing hate, the most superficial and deeply-prized sexual attraction values.
