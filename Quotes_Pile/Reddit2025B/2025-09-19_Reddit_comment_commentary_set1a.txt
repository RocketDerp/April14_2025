Russia has weaponized any pattern of media that digs deep into emotion, upsetting people, and using the White House global media platform to reach every other media platform. ... ... ... https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-ceo-alexander-nix-data-firm-describes-shadow-election-tactics-2018-03-19/ "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.

If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?

If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

There's also a theory that Trump's social media posts allow lonely idiots to form a parasocial relationship with Trump. They literally think he talks directly to them and is their friend.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron. Also, most of them are just regular morons too.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Too many people haven't figured this out yet. Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.


EDIT: according to my messages some guy called me "schizo" while immediately blocking me? lmao

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

There are decades of pseudo-propaganda pieces of media that elevate the rural communities of America as “better” or “more down to earth, civilized people”. Think of every movie or tv show where city people go to rural communities and learn the true meaning of Christmas or family and community or whatever. It’s literally all propaganda just to improve the image of rural people.

The doctor shortage bothers me more than anything because the USA is perfectly capable of training enough doctors but artificially limits the supply by limiting medical schools and the number of residents. This was because of actions by congress through heavy lobbying.


There are enough smart and talented individuals that want to become doctors to fix the shortage without importing doctors. There should be federal grants to encourage more people to become doctors.


I understand that immediately there will be a shortage, but there shouldn’t be a shortage in the first place and it should be fixed. Well after Trump is removed from office and hopefully will finds the fate most dictators find.

The Puritans were never kicked out of Britain. If anything, they took it over with Cromwell when they killed King Charles I.


They were millenarian, but they were trying to usher in the golden age before the end days, not the end days themselves. That's why Boston was supposed to be the shining city on a hill from the Sermon on the Mount. Some even thought Mexico City rather than Jerusalem would be the site.


But Puritans' weird Calvinist prosperity gospel endtimes nonsense was tempered by a deep belief in education and democracy.


The real problem was the Christian Reconstruction movement which fused the Calvinism of the Puritans onto Southern Baptism and created a true monster of a faith, in which there is no free will, the poor deserve it, the rich are rich by Grace of God, Israel is helping bring about the end days, that's good, and also democracy is bad, the melting pot is bad, racial hierarchy is good, and education is bad.


They just took the worst part about both religions and smashed them together. It was a deliberate project—to build a theonomic government run on libertarian economic principles.

Thomas Jefferson took a knife to the Bible and removed pages he did not agree with. Deleting content. Americans rarely know this or discuss this.

Not that it just denies him, they believe he burns in shit in hell according to the Talmud


Talmud Jesus in Excrement  
The Talmud does not explicitly state that Jesus is punished with boiling excrement. Instead, it presents a narrative where Onkelos raises a spirit named Yeshu by necromancy, and Yeshu replies that he is in "boiling excrement" as a punishment for his alleged misdeeds. This story is often cited as a reference to Jesus in the Talmud


The Talmud is the writings of Rabbi's ... after Jesus, the Jewish majority crumbled as people flocked to the christian faith and later Islam and the Rabbi's influence was never the same so there were years of hate written into the book as a result


Edit:


The Talmud also contains other horrors like:


"Rava said that this is what the mishna is saying: An adult man who engaged in intercourse with a minor girl less than three years old has done nothing, as intercourse with a girl less than three years old is tantamount to poking a finger into the eye. In the case of an eye, after a tear falls from it another tear forms to replace it. Similarly, the ruptured hymen of the girl younger than three is restored. And a young boy who engaged in intercourse with an adult woman renders her as one whose hymen was ruptured by wood. And with regard to the case of a woman whose hymen was ruptured by wood itself, there is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis."

Exactly. It’s wild how some Western Christians look down on Muslims (who at least revere Jesus as a prophet) while celebrating a religion that explicitly rejects him as the Messiah and often mocks him. There’s a serious disconnect there.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
The Quran is fanfiction of The Bible storytelling 600 years later. Retcon science fiction rewrites of Jesus and Mary story. The creation of the Arabic language and direct reading and memorization. Addictions to fiction storytelling need to be understood, it isn't just modern memes on social machines, there is a long human history of fiction storytelling being given by parents to children and people falling in love with fiction poetry and storytelling so much they abandon science realty / factual evidence itself. This can happen with ANY fiction storytelling, such as Fox News or Truth Social fiction content, not just old media venues like the Mosque and Church dramatized science fiction poetry reading. Russian information warfare creates pro-Putin fiction, often blended with religion message patterns / storytelling patterns (MonoMyth patterns, MonoMyth memes).

They’re so full of hatred, which is why they can’t be reasoned with.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
We can stand up to all hate in all places in all time periods. And not just stand u for hate upon Donald Trump, hate upon MAGA, hate upon this group or that group. All the world has a common problem, hate. We learned this from World War One and World War Two and the communications technology and book sharing technology / travel technology advancements. In 1954, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. published a new equation: ... ... ... February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr. ... ... ... "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true. That's what hate does. You can't see right. The symbol of objectivity is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

No he actually wasn’t too stoked about how Israel ended up forming and declined the presidency in 52. The version of Zionism he initially supported was one that emphasized co-existence with Arabs and rejected Jewish Nationalism and militarism.


This quote sums up his honest stance on the issue nicely…


“I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. … My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power no matter how modest.” - Einstein 1929

People like to point out hate as a specific group of people instead of The 1954 Equation from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. about all hate in all time periods and all geographic places being bad. Even hate on Reddit is bad, even street gangs on Truth Social is bad, Fox News hate is bad. Not just street gangs who walk on physical streets, but people who use massive organized technology systems and even entire governments to promote and praise hate. Rupert Murdoch has created information systems all over the world to promote hate of poor people / dehumanization of people gang attitudes.

:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Religion isn't *conceived* this way always. Science fiction storytelling is popular. Star Wars 1977 film was in some ways conceived that way from 1949 book "Hero With a Thousand Faces" on religion, and George Lucas has discussed Joseph Campbell's mentoring in interviews with Bill Moyers. But classical religions were adopted by government systems, such as the Roman Empire in year 380 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_as_the_Roman_state_religion - and Mohammad organized creation of the Arabic language and such. But fiction addiction takes on a life of own, Harry Potter fanatics, Lord of the Rings fanatics, etc. Reddit has a cult of Lord of the Rings memes / images / storytelling. The crisis is that people can't translate the popularity of Jesus science fiction storytelling / legends passed down, with modern science fiction. L Ron Hubbard demonstrated this in 1953. Fox News fiction storytelling in USA is a cult of media. In general, fiction outsells nonfiction, fiction is more popular than science nonfiction. ... ... ...

They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban

It’s crazy how this comment section is a bunch of “experts” making completely false conclusions. I am staunchly pro-palestine, but you all completely misunderstand the political situation in Israel.


These are all Hasidic Jews. Hasidic Jews are not zionists, in fact they hate Zionism as they see it as heretical. according to them, Israel should only be a Jewish state when the Jewish messiah equivalent happens. So they see Zionism as a whole and heretical and repulsive. They will spit on anyone outwardly showing it, especially in their neighborhoods.


They are pretty awful people. They’ll also throw rocks at you for breaking Shabbat rules. But this narrative that these are standard Israelies is crazy. Normal israelis can and will be awful in plenty of other ways, but they love to see American support lol (except for the portion that is pro-Palestine WHICH EXISTS). Most israelis are secular and could not give a shit if you’re Christian either. Good luck with your victim complex tho Christians

This is a humanity problem that per-dates the Reddit comment section, but people are not facing up that free time and spare time used by social media users is not promoting goodness for all people in all places. ... ... ... "The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world. The problem is with man himself and man's soul. We haven't learned how to be just and honest and kind and true and loving. And that is the basis of our problem. The real problem is that through our scientific genius we've made of the world a neighborhood, but through our moral and spiritual genius we've failed to make of it a brotherhood." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. February 28, 1954

Christian Zionists believe Genesis 12:3, "I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you." is in regards to modern Israel.


They believe the return of the Jewish people to the promised land is necessary to fulfill biblical prophecy (Ezekiel) of the second coming of Christ.


But, Christians also believe that "there is no fast track to paradise for the chosen people" since, "Jews are not saved by Judaism, but through Jesus, like everyone else" (Steve Malta), and will be damned at Judgement.


Over 100 million Christian Zionists are **using** Israeli Jews in order to bring down heaven, and at the same time it will get rid of the adherents of Judaism.


Maybe some Israelis think she's a snake.
