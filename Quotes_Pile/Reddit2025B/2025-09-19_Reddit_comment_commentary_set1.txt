Russia has wepaonized any pattern of media that digs deep into emotion, upsetting people, and using the White House global media platform to reach every other media platform. ... ... ... https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-ceo-alexander-nix-data-firm-describes-shadow-election-tactics-2018-03-19/ "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Yeah the root cause of all of this seems to be an inability to easily police differing opinions vs legit foreign propaganda.

If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?

If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.

There's also a theory that Trump's social media posts allow lonely idiots to form a parasocial relationship with Trump. They literally think he talks directly to them and is their friend.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.

Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Yeah the root cause of all of this seems to be an inability to easily police differing opinions vs legit foreign propaganda. We CANNOT let bad actors forcefeed us propaganda designed to destroy America. Choosing to permit that has caused this conflict and if we survive and continue we'll have the same issue with a new face every other election cycle.

When you're young and you're faced with 2 options - be responsible, caring and help others - or - the world was made for you and how you think and you are to be emboldened and cared FOR.... yeah which path you think they're gonna choose.

List of Charlie Kirk statements


On race


If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 23 January 2024


If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 8 December 2022


Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 19 May 2023


If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.

Remember way back, like a year ago, when Kamala Harris said Trump was going to send the military into American cities and a bunch of anti-doomers/fascism-curious folks were like "that's fearmongering, alarmist, and absurd." And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?

Russia has wepaonized any pattern of media that digs deep into emotion, upsetting people, and using the White House global media platform to reach every other media platform. ... ... ... https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cambridge-analytica-ceo-alexander-nix-data-firm-describes-shadow-election-tactics-2018-03-19/ "The two fundamental human driver when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and the even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you," Turnbull explained in a meeting with a reporter posing as "Ranjan," a prospective client from Sri Lanka. He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.

If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

Imagine any other situation where someone says that to another person....its un-fucking-hinged. I look forward to the day I no longer need to worry waht that fucker is going to say or do next. Ideally sometime in the next month or two when out elected officials finally decide to hold him accountable.  I think I'll hold my breath.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Nobody can defeat sarcasm, irony, absurd. For over 25 years, Putin has used Surkovian techniques to exploit minds. No defense has been found. It blows minds when you use sarcasm, surreal, absurd, irony, humor, amusement, entertainment on serious topics. People abandon nonfiction.

there is so much power being held over everyone's heads.


the reason why ABC and places are taking a knee, as well as why the president is dining with the King of England. There is so much leverage being held in things like the Epstein files and power to use government control to cripple groups that stand against MAGA.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Yeah the root cause of all of this seems to be an inability to easily police differing opinions vs legit foreign propaganda. We CANNOT let bad actors forcefeed us propaganda designed to destroy America. Choosing to permit that has caused this conflict and if we survive and continue we'll have the same issue with a new face every other election cycle.

And next round it'll be 85m. Because adults don't just stop watching Fox News when they've been brainwashed that every other media outlet is fake. And young boys/men who haven't fully developed their frontal lobes will keep listening to manosphere talking points because it sure sounds easier than having personal accountability and empathy. When you're young and you're faced with 2 options - be responsible, caring and help others - or - the world was made for you and how you think and you are to be emboldened and cared FOR.... yeah which path you think they're gonna choose.

List of Charlie Kirk statements


On race


If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 23 January 2024


If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 8 December 2022


Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 19 May 2023


If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.


They aren't thinking it through.

Remember way back, like a year ago, when Kamala Harris said Trump was going to send the military into American cities and a bunch of anti-doomers/fascism-curious folks were like "that's fearmongering, alarmist, and absurd." And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?


There are no values, policies, or utterable objectives or "end states" of this adminstration. Just a never-ending grievance politics and escalating sadism.

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron. Also, most of them are just regular morons too.

I mean the goal is to elevate him to a level of MLK or Lincoln. This is the end result of conservative victimhood. Charlie Kirk was a civil rights leader for a group of people who were never under attack to begin with but whose supporters live in a perpetual state of victimization.

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?

If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.

There's also a theory that Trump's social media posts allow lonely idiots to form a parasocial relationship with Trump. They literally think he talks directly to them and is their friend.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.


They aren't thinking it through.

Remember way back, like a year ago, when Kamala Harris said Trump was going to send the military into American cities and a bunch of anti-doomers/fascism-curious folks were like "that's fearmongering, alarmist, and absurd." And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?


There are no values, policies, or utterable objectives or "end states" of this adminstration. Just a never-ending grievance politics and escalating sadism.

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron. Also, most of them are just regular morons too.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Too many people haven't figured this out yet. Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.


EDIT: according to my messages some guy called me "schizo" while immediately blocking me? lmao

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

– The Charlie Kirk Show, 19 May 2023


If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 13 July 2023

If you had told me just one year ago that public discourse over authoritarianism and the first amendment would be all about Charlie Kirk and Jimmy Kimmel being venerated on opposing sides, I would have asked you for some of whatever you were smoking because it's obviously the good shit.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.


They aren't thinking it through.

Remember way back, like a year ago, when Kamala Harris said Trump was going to send the military into American cities and a bunch of anti-doomers/fascism-curious folks were like "that's fearmongering, alarmist, and absurd." And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?


There are no values, policies, or utterable objectives or "end states" of this adminstration. Just a never-ending grievance politics and escalating sadism.

I know a black guy who voted for him. I’m sure there’s many. Not trying to make it about race I just don’t get how ANY person who will spend their life as part of a group that is hated by Trump would not only not be against him but support him too

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.

Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Yeah the root cause of all of this seems to be an inability to easily police differing opinions vs legit foreign propaganda. We CANNOT let bad actors forcefeed us propaganda designed to destroy America. Choosing to permit that has caused this conflict and if we survive and continue we'll have the same issue with a new face every other election cycle.

When you're young and you're faced with 2 options - be responsible, caring and help others - or - the world was made for you and how you think and you are to be emboldened and cared FOR.... yeah which path you think they're gonna choose.

List of Charlie Kirk statements


On race


If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 23 January 2024


If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 8 December 2022


Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 19 May 2023


If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

Mockery on Bluesky and Reddit goes up every time Trump does an absurd surreal mind exploit. Antics politics for over a decade. Surkovian Russian techniques get people to flock to media machines and declare how terrible, bad President Tony Clifton is. Media addicts in reactionary addictions.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.


They aren't thinking it through.

Remember way back, like a year ago, when Kamala Harris said Trump was going to send the military into American cities and a bunch of anti-doomers/fascism-curious folks were like "that's fearmongering, alarmist, and absurd." And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?


There are no values, policies, or utterable objectives or "end states" of this adminstration. Just a never-ending grievance politics and escalating sadism.

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

Russia mind-fucked the entire population of USA since March 2013. Not just Republicans, not just MAGA. Not everyone *fell for* (The Fall) the ficiton at the same time, but eventullay anti-MAGA concerns adopted *hate harder / mock harder* values of Trump. Faith in mocking, faith in hate, avoidance of nonfiction books and authors about Russian information warfare.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron. Also, most of them are just regular morons too.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Too many people haven't figured this out yet. Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

There are decades of pseudo-propaganda pieces of media that elevate the rural communities of America as “better” or “more down to earth, civilized people”. Think of every movie or tv show where city people go to rural communities and learn the true meaning of Christmas or family and community or whatever. It’s literally all propaganda just to improve the image of rural people.

The doctor shortage bothers me more than anything because the USA is perfectly capable of training enough doctors but artificially limits the supply by limiting medical schools and the number of residents. This was because of actions by congress through heavy lobbying.


There are enough smart and talented individuals that want to become doctors to fix the shortage without importing doctors. There should be federal grants to encourage more people to become doctors.


I understand that immediately there will be a shortage, but there shouldn’t be a shortage in the first place and it should be fixed. Well after Trump is removed from office and hopefully will finds the fate most dictators find.

And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Yeah the root cause of all of this seems to be an inability to easily police differing opinions vs legit foreign propaganda.

And next round it'll be 85m. Because adults don't just stop watching Fox News when they've been brainwashed that every other media outlet is fake. And young boys/men who haven't fully developed their frontal lobes will keep listening to manosphere talking points because it sure sounds easier than having personal accountability and empathy. When you're young and you're faced with 2 options - be responsible, caring and help others - or - the world was made for you and how you think and you are to be emboldened and cared FOR.... yeah which path you think they're gonna choose.

List of Charlie Kirk statements


On race


If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 23 January 2024


If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 8 December 2022


Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 19 May 2023


If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.


They aren't thinking it through.

Remember way back, like a year ago, when Kamala Harris said Trump was going to send the military into American cities and a bunch of anti-doomers/fascism-curious folks were like "that's fearmongering, alarmist, and absurd." And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?


There are no values, policies, or utterable objectives or "end states" of this adminstration. Just a never-ending grievance politics and escalating sadism.

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Too many people haven't figured this out yet. Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.


EDIT: according to my messages some guy called me "schizo" while immediately blocking me? lmao

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

There are decades of pseudo-propaganda pieces of media that elevate the rural communities of America as “better” or “more down to earth, civilized people”. Think of every movie or tv show where city people go to rural communities and learn the true meaning of Christmas or family and community or whatever. It’s literally all propaganda just to improve the image of rural people.

The doctor shortage bothers me more than anything because the USA is perfectly capable of training enough doctors but artificially limits the supply by limiting medical schools and the number of residents. This was because of actions by congress through heavy lobbying.


There are enough smart and talented individuals that want to become doctors to fix the shortage without importing doctors. There should be federal grants to encourage more people to become doctors.


I understand that immediately there will be a shortage, but there shouldn’t be a shortage in the first place and it should be fixed. Well after Trump is removed from office and hopefully will finds the fate most dictators find.

There was a pretty consistent push from right after Biden won to convince people not to vote. First it was student loans, then it was Roe, then it was back to student loans, or inflation.

The View was always enemy number 1 for these people and it will be interesting to see if the ladies settle down or confront the issue.


I have a feeling The View will now start to self censor and other shows and presenters will follow suit


I just want to clarify that this isnt what I want to see happen but it is what I think we will see happen and the irony is that Kirk said he preached free speech and debate so surely what we're seeing now if the opposite of what surely he would liked to have seen happen.

He continued, "And our job is to get, is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. There is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion."

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?

Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.

If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

There's also a theory that Trump's social media posts allow lonely idiots to form a parasocial relationship with Trump. They literally think he talks directly to them and is their friend.

Very true. He's the first "president" in our country's history who's needed a plethora of interpreters to explain "what he really meant". If he can't *ASSIMILATE* into this country and learn to communicate without them, maybe he should go somewhere else...
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.

And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron. Also, most of them are just regular morons too.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Too many people haven't figured this out yet. Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.


EDIT: according to my messages some guy called me "schizo" while immediately blocking me? lmao

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

There are decades of pseudo-propaganda pieces of media that elevate the rural communities of America as “better” or “more down to earth, civilized people”. Think of every movie or tv show where city people go to rural communities and learn the true meaning of Christmas or family and community or whatever. It’s literally all propaganda just to improve the image of rural people.

The doctor shortage bothers me more than anything because the USA is perfectly capable of training enough doctors but artificially limits the supply by limiting medical schools and the number of residents. This was because of actions by congress through heavy lobbying.


There are enough smart and talented individuals that want to become doctors to fix the shortage without importing doctors. There should be federal grants to encourage more people to become doctors.


I understand that immediately there will be a shortage, but there shouldn’t be a shortage in the first place and it should be fixed. Well after Trump is removed from office and hopefully will finds the fate most dictators find.

I just want to clarify that this isnt what I want to see happen but it is what I think we will see happen and the irony is that Kirk said he preached free speech and debate so surely what we're seeing now if the opposite of what surely he would liked to have seen happen.

He made fun of Trump, not Kirk and was fired. Fox turd says to openly murder homeless people and he gave us a disingenious apology. And within the week multiple homeless people were shot in Minneapolis. Yet that POS still has a job. Republicans don't need to follow social rules or any amount of public decorum. Next time a MAGA complains we need to collectively ignore them because their outrage is fictional.

He said kill them......AND THEN DAYS LATER PEOPLE DID IT. What the fucking fuck world is this, every day I feel like I'm going insane.

For anyone who wonders how the Nazis got normal Germans to go all in and do heinous things to other humans, look no further.


The constant dehumanization that the right engages in has lead to this.

Denial of the Internet Research Agency, not citing any authors, not droping any book titles or links. Just claiming the out-group is dehumanizing just as conditioned since March 2013 by Russian information warfare. Machine (Reddit servers, media touch devices) dehumanization.

Back when I considered myself conservative-leaning, it was stuff like this Kimmel thing that caused me to feel that way. It was because I wanted limited government -- not "no government" or "no taxes", just limited government interference in people's lives. I wanted the FCC abolished with a new entity in charge of managing frequency distribution and that being strictly limited to "these bands are public and anyone can use. These bands are leased by individuals or businesses for use in this specific region and we enforce that and make sure nobody else impedes their usage of them." Nothing more and nothing less. No morality policing, no censoring, let the market dictate what can or cannot be broadcast.


Cable and satellite really made me believe that was the sort of way it should be, since 'broadcast media' couldn't compete with cable/satellite in content because of how they were limited. Why is it okay for the '7 naughty words' to be said on basic cable but not on network television? Because one is distributed via radio waves while the other comes through a cable? That's just yet another stupid example of government not keeping up with or understanding technology.


And so now we have a guy saying something perfectly reasonable and thought out censored by government threat, while another guy can call for murder and government shrugs and says, "whatcha gonna do?" Then that guy has the gall to lecture about how the reasonable guy was unreasonable. And they're trying to spin it that it was all done by business and there was no government interference, all while the FCC was making threats.


The only good thing, for me, that has come from Trump being in office either time is that it made me realize the beliefs I hold that I thought were conservative beliefs really aren't, even though the alleged conservatives claimed to espouse them.
:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Media ecology education of cable TV vs. over-the-air TV is essential for the public. Further, the whole conservative vs. liberal topic is so polluted and non-specific. People need to make named lists of what they support and what they do not support in detail. And say "I support Jim's values list #1", or "I support everything Russia does in 2025 as a set of values as a conservative". With all the technology changes to society (that conservatives embrace, such as social media computers and Apple iPhone / iPad, which are not conserving lifestyle) and information warfare - a named specific list of details that people publish in public would be much easier to relate to.

It is unreal how far right we have moved in such a short time.


*To the 'It hasn't been a short time' crowd, the point isn't that the conservative movement hasn't been on this path for the past however many years/decades (I'd start it at least with Nixon but it can go well beyond then) but that through all that time and effort, including trump 1.0, they only moved the needle a little more than 50%.  There was viable resistance as recently as 11/5/24.  The world changed dramatically on 1/20/25.

Yeah the root cause of all of this seems to be an inability to easily police differing opinions vs legit foreign propaganda.

Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.

If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?


– The Charlie Kirk Show, 3 January 2024


If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.

If you sustain attention, the Trump White House + Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, cover a topic from many many perspectives. Almost always fiction. It becomes a "choose your own adventure" interactive media game, interactive fiction storytelling. One of the key aspects of Surkovian Russian governing techniques the past 25 years, adapted to world media systems. When a popular gap is missing, a new fiction / anti-reality interpretation pops up.

They think war is a fun thing you can do as a day job. Reality is a crashed economy, their children being drafted, air raid sirens at night. Look at pictures of Gaza, that's what the US will look like. The rest of the world will take sides and start sanctioning and seizing money. When it's over and millions are dead, the US would take decades to rebuild and would never regain its standing as a world power.

And now those same people are seemingly bending over backwards to support this?

I mean, no disrespect at all, but this is a perfect example, every time you use racism here you could’ve used the word white supremacy.  Like there’s homophobic trans phobic xenophobic antisemitic, but when it comes to talking about this specific subject coming from a specific set of people in power, it goes to this vague, broad racism term instead of calling what it really is, which is white supremacy. I mean, no disrespect. I’m just using your comment to approve the point of how we avoid the clear word and go with a vague one in this specific situation for some reason.  Sometimes they’ll even prefer the word Nazi and we know they’re not Nazis because the Nazis were a political party in Germany. But the Nazis were indeed white supremacist. So they are using an incorrect word which is not what they are Nazis, instead of more accurate and clearer word, which would be white supremacist.

"You're taking it out of context." Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, and ignoring how often he lied about things that were easy to research, basically his main contribution was surface level criticisms and joking about things. Reason, he had absolutely nothing really intelligent to say. All of his non-inflammatory discussions were basically Bible verses and the most general political opinions. Never said anything that was powerfully original, wasn't an expert in any particular field where he could illuminate an issue, his solutions to issues were basic political philosophies not grounded in any data. He was a good showman, like Trump, but his political thoughts at best was just him repeating decades of Republican talking points. His Cambridge debates demonstrated he had talking points and that's as deep as it got with him and that's why he was exposed for how thin his knowledge was. Once confronted with facts, more educated reason arguing, hypocrisies being pointed out, he never had an intelligent response back. He stuck to talking points, insults, and sarcasm because he was an intellectual lightweight who couldn't offer up anything thoughtful that came from his own brain.

Charlie Kirk was a Christofascist white supremacist. Full stop.


He looked down on anyone who wasn’t a white Christian male. He didn’t even view white women as equals, he thought their job was to baby factories and be subservient to their husbands

As a non-American observing this from a distance (through social media and mainstream news outlets), it's funny how the status quo right now seems to be the following:



The Trump admin doing horrible stuff everyday.


Most establishment democrats showing a total and utter lack of spine.


Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spewing the truth.

Indeed it is. Every exchange I've had with one of them is so draining. Like they've been coached on techniques to drain a person's hope, optimism and energy just by being obtuse, irrational and stupid. They can call you every name under the sun, but you say anything marginally critical of their flawed thought process and *you're* the one being insulting.


I had a pointless argument the other day with someone who believes the killer of CK is a fascist because he killed someone to silence their political views because he disagreed with those views. The killer may well be a fascist, I kinda fell it's unlikely based on what we know so far, but the person (or bot, who knows!) I was debating with would not accept that this is not the definition of 'fascism'. There's a lot more to it than just killing people you don't like.


If you ever think you can get through to them, you can't. You can't reason with someone who works outside of the realms of facts and logic. This is a reminder to myself as much as anything! They are indeed in a cult, and I hope one day they realise it.

No they don't. Church is just virtue signaling. You cannot be a Christian and also support brutalizing immigrants, or cutting people's health care, or cutting food stamps or international AID or lifesaving research. They just like having their religion as a bludgeon, to give themselves an artificial moral high ground in order to lord it over other people. "Conservative Christian" is an oxymoron. Also, most of them are just regular morons too.

One of the main reasons I'm an atheist, dude. The rapture is one of the most insane modern ideas I have ever fucking heard. It's so unbelievably selfish, shitty, and ironically extremely hedonistic.

I mean the goal is to elevate him to a level of MLK or Lincoln. This is the end result of conservative victimhood. Charlie Kirk was a civil rights leader for a group of people who were never under attack to begin with but whose supporters live in a perpetual state of victimization.

I used to have a buddy that was very anti-government. I didn’t subscribe to all of his thoughts but there was a lot of “bad money in politics” kinda stuff. I wasn’t really paying attention to politics back then. I figured we were pretty similar politically. So I was surprised to see that he became one of the biggest Trump supporters all the way through his first administration and beyond. (I don’t keep track of him any but I assume he’s still up Trump’s ass.) He was only anti-government when it was a black president. He’s just a racist and I’m ashamed I didn’t pick up on it sooner.

Too many people haven't figured this out yet. Your elected officials can't do jack shit to fight back when the controlling government is making rules that they do not have to follow but everyone else does. That fight was lost the moment Trump won the election with the help of Republican state voter suppression, Supreme Court interference, and legalese nonsense. Now all that's left is for regular people to decide if they really want to make a difference or not, and that's all there is to it.


It's also something people will have to commit themselves to 24/7/365 until a critical mass point is reached where enough people can overthrow this government. Unless that happens, you end up with modern Russia where the people are so demoralized and lacking any spirit that they will never fight back in a large enough force. That's how fascism wins.

Getting banned because of a Charlie Kirk joke when Hasan has made multiple calls for violence and played literal terrorist propaganda that he praised is diabolical.


Someone getting weeks for calling someone fat and Mike From PA getting less time for asking to get Destiny killed. Mike From PA getting no ban for calling Jews demonic (and apparently then getting banned for 3 days for saying "buck broken"?).


Hasan not getting banned for repeatedly referring to Jews as inbred, and Destiny getting permabanned for calling trans twitter activists inbred.


SeanDaBlack not getting banned for encouraging Destiny to be stabbed.


Twitch throwing the unfavored to the wolves to try and protect their constant TOS breaking sacred cows.

It's always good to bring receipts. Remember when Joe Rogan had the twitter heads in his podcasts and cried about "Why did you ban Milo" and they had the receipts ready why he was permabanned.  Ironically Milo also destroyed his entire career on Joe Rogan.


It's also not much work for twitch to search chatlogs for "Kirk", "shot in Utah" to filter streamers who did a reaction.


It isn't really bowing to Trump but to avoid a removal of Section 230. Trump went on unhinged rants and threats that create could result in a media landscape like Hungary.

How the fuck did we let it get to this point. Why are the loudest, craziest people you’ve ever met both in control and gaining support by the day. Like who the fuck sees this and says oh yeah I’m gonna be like that too?

Russia won an information war since year 2013. People can't even name Cambridge Analytica and the Russain Internet Agency. People have no self-awareness of media ecology. People think only Fox News alters behaviors towards self-harm.

This is what blows my mind. I don't understand what democratic policy could cause a reaction like this. Dem policies are just social services and trying to ensure rights for everyone. How that makes a person "hateful" is beyond me

I just wish something would happen that made them all suffer a massive brain aneurysm so we could all just be fucking done with this nonsense already. Tired of having society held hostage by psychopaths.

We could wish for a popular teacher like Carl Sagan to come along, a social reforme like Malala from Pakistan and change their minds to not be addicted to fiction. Instead of death-wsishing people that were mind-fucked by Russian information warfare since year 2013. Putin won, Surkov won. Americans hate upon Americans instead of desiring positive improvement to the situation.

The lulz crowd are an underrated component of MAGA. Libs and lefts could do with understanding there is a substantial crowd of Trump supporters who aren't so much true believers as much as nihilists who don't give a fuck and want to giggle as the world burns down around them.

There are decades of pseudo-propaganda pieces of media that elevate the rural communities of America as “better” or “more down to earth, civilized people”. Think of every movie or tv show where city people go to rural communities and learn the true meaning of Christmas or family and community or whatever. It’s literally all propaganda just to improve the image of rural people.


t. Someone who actually lived in rural areas and is fully aware that they are ten times more atomized, isolated and ignorant than the average suburban or even city dweller

China is courting engineers and R&D specialists across nearly every field. Their new breed of EVs were designed by German and Italian designers. They've poached top people from Nvidia and TSMC. Meanwhile the US is doing the exact opposite and trying it's best to make the country hostile to foreign talent.

The doctor shortage bothers me more than anything because the USA is perfectly capable of training enough doctors but artificially limits the supply by limiting medical schools and the number of residents. This was because of actions by congress through heavy lobbying.


There are enough smart and talented individuals that want to become doctors to fix the shortage without importing doctors. There should be federal grants to encourage more people to become doctors.


I understand that immediately there will be a shortage, but there shouldn’t be a shortage in the first place and it should be fixed. Well after Trump is removed from office and hopefully will finds the fate most dictators find.

There was a pretty consistent push from right after Biden won to convince people not to vote. First it was student loans, then it was Roe, then it was back to student loans, or inflation. Eventually it was Gaza. There were certain political subs that it was clear there was an influence campaign going on, whether it was foreign or homegrown, I have no clue, but it was there

The View was always enemy number 1 for these people and it will be interesting to see if the ladies settle down or confront the issue.


I have a feeling The View will now start to self censor and other shows and presenters will follow suit


I just want to clarify that this isnt what I want to see happen but it is what I think we will see happen and the irony is that Kirk said he preached free speech and debate so surely what we're seeing now if the opposite of what surely he would liked to have seen happen.
