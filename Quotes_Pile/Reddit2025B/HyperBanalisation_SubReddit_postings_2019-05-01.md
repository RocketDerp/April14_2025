The weeks right before COVID-2019 Global Pandemic. This Reddit Hyper Banalisation public posting I created is dated November 23, 2019. By that point, Russia had mind-fucked Reddit into total back and forth feedback loops about pandemic outbreaks. Since year 2014. **Factual evidence about Russia from Johns Hopkins University and George Washington University disclosed globally August 24, 2018**. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

Trump gets away with it because people are attracted to his wildly creative **Tony Clifton NYC SNL** (Trump home town, his TV addictions) techniques. Orange skin, poop diaper, it gives Reddit audiences every banality they crave. A dumb-shit signal leadership for crowds into mob mentality. Surkov won since March 2013.
