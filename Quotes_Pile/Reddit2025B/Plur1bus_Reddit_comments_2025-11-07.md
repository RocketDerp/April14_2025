Published August 2000: "Howard Bloom's Global Brain argues that life has evolved as a "worldwide learning machine" or "global brain," with each species playing a role in a massive, interconnected system. This isn't a new phenomenon but an evolutionary process dating back to early bacterial colonies, which continued through social animals like spiny lobsters and bees, and is now manifesting in human society and digital networks. The book proposes that culture and society are not just byproducts of individual evolution but are shaped by a "mass mind" that tests ideas through group selection and competition, with technology like the internet being a recent step in this long history.

People watching a TV show for entertainment are very disconnected from the reality of *living that character*. People try to *read* Finnegans Wake, not **EXPERIENCE***. Campbell, The Power Of Myth: "The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience."

Post-satire, post-irony, satire-poisoning.  The year 1940 film with Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator. It comes to mind in better-written words than my own: "I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness."

At 23 minutes into episode 1, at the Public House bar, the book by James Joyce is introduced by Helen. There is no begin or end to Finnegans Wake, you are thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool. You are not told who the characters are, who is speaking, etc.

Helen then goes into the parking lot, opens LOL social media, and falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan.

Finnegans Wake is the most powerful book ever created by humanity about media ecology. It is a slap in the audience face in episode 1. It ends the whole world. This story is about a **book author and a book publisher, married Helen and Carol.**

Every writer / athlete / publisher has some injury or excuse why they are not first palce - but simple reality is in a world of over 8 billion people - how maby can actually BE number 1. The maths of household names and maths of ranking "best". You will see TV show fandom constantly saying x show deserved all these awards. The math does not check out. There is a lacking of counting of media ecology. Some books are written that are not understood or appreciated for decades. Until a farmer digs them up during World War Two in Egypt....

A media addict who doesn't care if Trump and Putin rule the world and The Lord of the Rings inspires people to join Sauron. That the media clergy of science fiction (Bible is science fiction) teaches equality of good and evil and choose whichever you wish.

I think the real world is proving the Skywalker Ranch 1985 / 1986 / 1987 lessons correct that were filmed by George Lucas. Published in 1988, "The Power Of Myth".

Notable that Bill Moyers worked staff in the White House, studied the meaning of Pluribus. He isn't just any interviewer.

BILL MOYERS: No, but given the absence of initiation rituals, which have largely disappeared from our society, the world of imagination as projected on that screen serves, even if in a faulty way, to tell that story, doesn’t it?

CAMPBELL: Yes, but what is unfortunate for us is that a lot of the **people who write these stories do not have the sense of their responsibility.** These stories are making and breaking lives. But the movies are made simply to make money. The kind of **responsibility that goes into a priesthood** with a ritual is not there. That is one of our problems today.

BILL MOYERS: We have none of those rites today, do we?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I’m afraid we don’t. So the youngsters invent them themselves, and you have **these raiding gangs**, and so forth — that is self-rendered initiation.

New Mexico cults, New Mexico authored atomic bomb that Carol asks about, New Mexico science of meth drug perfect science, New Mexico that hates Mexicans of Mexico. New Mexico where prop guns / prop weapons are confused on book authoring movie sets. New Mexico where you invite an Africa stranger into your house, booze up and pop heavy pills, and play with guns. New Mexico where you attack an African in front of your house and kill millions with the butterfly effect. Drunken wild west indeepndence. On the frontier, Carol's house of airport world wide pirate book publication, right next to the untamed frontier. Going wilding. New Mexico, where satire-washing and amusement-washing and entertainment-washing of the cancer health care crisis / meth drug crisis / loaded proop weapon crisis / boozing crisis / egomania crisis.... /s satire.
