Published August 2000: "Howard Bloom's Global Brain argues that life has evolved as a "worldwide learning machine" or "global brain," with each species playing a role in a massive, interconnected system. This isn't a new phenomenon but an evolutionary process dating back to early bacterial colonies, which continued through social animals like spiny lobsters and bees, and is now manifesting in human society and digital networks. The book proposes that culture and society are not just byproducts of individual evolution but are shaped by a "mass mind" that tests ideas through group selection and competition, with technology like the internet being a recent step in this long history.

People watching a TV show for entertainment are very disconnected from the reality of *living that character*. People try to *read* Finnegans Wake, not **EXPERIENCE***. Campbell, The Power Of Myth: "The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience."

Post-satire, post-irony, satire-poisoning.  The year 1940 film with Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator. It comes to mind in better-written words than my own: "I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness."

At 23 minutes into episode 1, at the Public House bar, the book by James Joyce is introduced by Helen. There is no begin or end to Finnegans Wake, you are thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool. You are not told who the characters are, who is speaking, etc.

Helen then goes into the parking lot, opens LOL social media, and falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan.

Finnegans Wake is the most powerful book ever created by humanity about media ecology. It is a slap in the audience face in episode 1. It ends the whole world. This story is about a **book author and a book publisher, married Helen and Carol.**

Every writer / athlete / publisher has some injury or excuse why they are not first palce - but simple reality is in a world of over 8 billion people - how maby can actually BE number 1. The maths of household names and maths of ranking "best". You will see TV show fandom constantly saying x show deserved all these awards. The math does not check out. There is a lacking of counting of media ecology. Some books are written that are not understood or appreciated for decades. Until a farmer digs them up during World War Two in Egypt....

A media addict who doesn't care if Trump and Putin rule the world and The Lord of the Rings inspires people to join Sauron. That the media clergy of science fiction (Bible is science fiction) teaches equality of good and evil and choose whichever you wish.

I think the real world is proving the Skywalker Ranch 1985 / 1986 / 1987 lessons correct that were filmed by George Lucas. Published in 1988, "The Power Of Myth".

Notable that Bill Moyers worked staff in the White House, studied the meaning of Pluribus. He isn't just any interviewer.

BILL MOYERS: No, but given the absence of initiation rituals, which have largely disappeared from our society, the world of imagination as projected on that screen serves, even if in a faulty way, to tell that story, doesn’t it?

CAMPBELL: Yes, but what is unfortunate for us is that a lot of the **people who write these stories do not have the sense of their responsibility.** These stories are making and breaking lives. But the movies are made simply to make money. The kind of **responsibility that goes into a priesthood** with a ritual is not there. That is one of our problems today.

BILL MOYERS: We have none of those rites today, do we?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I’m afraid we don’t. So the youngsters invent them themselves, and you have **these raiding gangs**, and so forth — that is self-rendered initiation.

New Mexico where prop guns / prop weapons are confused on book authoring movie sets. New Mexico where you invite an Africa stranger into your house, booze up and pop heavy pills, and play with guns. New Mexico where you attack an African in front of your house and kill millions with the butterfly effect. Drunken wild west indeepndence. On the frontier, Carol's house of airport world wide pirate book publication, right next to the untamed frontier. Going wilding. New Mexico, where satire-washing and amusement-washing and entertainment-washing of the cancer health care crisis / meth drug crisis / loaded proop weapon crisis / boozing crisis / egomania crisis.... /s satire.

Yes. Murdering 13 for greater good. Automobile wrecks alone kill way more than that. People dangerous with machines, like Carol thinks loaded guns are a toy to play with while drunk in her house... pointing it to an African immigrant she disagrees with.

Yep. ant hills are natural. Poison plants are natural. The show says zoo animals interaction issues to raise this point. This show is (not only) about creating genetic engineered life, rewriting nature.

Bingo. Carol is baiting a trap for her enemy. The audience is drowning in sarcasm / satire in USA society. If Carol does not trust the hive mind, why invite it into her house for drinks. When you invite someone into your home office for drinks ih the middle of the night and put a loaded gun on the table... and you attempt a murder/suicide...

https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1oyz3dt/1x03_survival_instinct/np88qms/

The previous mocking user blocked, so I can't reply. A mock and block tactic that prevents any reply in the thread, even to other people.

Finnegans Wake at 23 minutes into Episode One of Pluribus... the Tower of Babel conflicts.

https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1oyu3ik/1x03_blows_the_lid_wide_open_on_story_potential/np76bkt/

Yes. Sarcasm does not excuse taking a loaded weapon and pointing it at someone and dong murder-suicide. Carol is deathy afraid of the hive mind, and plays dumb that they would not give a rael Air Force One or a real loaded gun.

https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1ozi8lg/i_told_my_son_about_the_show_and_he_had_a_theory/npbor8i/

The technology change to Earth / humans is massive. So many misunderstandings and poor information has been recognized. Having framed it as invasive / alien / disease - a cure is now to keep the best of the changes and restore what people like Carol prize. It is still early in the show, and what may seem stable in the values and hive behavior may be infiltrated / temporary stage. It has always bothered me that people don't recognize the entertainmennt addiction of Star Wars and Star Trek alawys havig wars / enemy. Like the universe never escapes humnan hate. A dog that attacks and always prizes hate would be put to death in many Earth culutres. But Rupert Murdoch people who prize hate and attack other groups of humans is treated as normal. Ad evolving technology to Star Wars level of blowing up entire planets with weapon systems is considred progress of humanity. MLK Jr even talked about breaking the chain of hate for the entire universe. Boy, that would be hard to sell as entertaining to audiences, but it isn't an unknown human ideal. ... ... ...        
"And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe."

Another example of an audience member who thinks that the story is not highlighting human behaviros. Humans who create guns, humans in New Mexico who create nuclear bombs (which Carol brings up at end of episode). Carl Sagan's January 1994. "**An extraterrestrial being, newly arrived on Earth -- scrutinizing** what we mainly present to our children in TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, the comics and many books -- might easily conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape, cruelty, superstition and consumerism." https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1994/01/09/with-science-on-our-side/9e5d2141-9d53-4b4b-aa0f-7a6a0faff845/ - the metaphors of how EASY we have made bomb delivery and HOW HARD we have made dialog outside English / Spanish for Carol. How alien the idea of solving problems as much as we are motivated to "play" with booze and weapons. The subconsious revenge desires. How there is no clergy on demand, yoga on demand, but ambulace for bombing each other. The death-wishing and weapon-system creation that humanity prizes. The mockery we make of Malala and MLK Jr and others who try to actually enage society mass dehumanization. Where are the mental health workers engaging Putin's society since Februarhy 2014 as they attack Ukraine?

I think this is one of the reasons billionaires have invested so much in artificial intelligence that can do video. Wealthy people will be able to have shows rewritten for them. "Dear A.I. machine, show me Pluribus with all the boring parts I don't desire removed and edited out".

There is huge demand out there for people slashing out all the stuff they don't like. Or replacing actors they don't like, any egoism people desire.

reference: "Topher Grace's fan edit of the Star Wars prequels, which he condensed into a single 85-minute film. This was an unauthorized fan edit that re-edited the three prequel movies into a single narrative, removing plot points like Jar Jar Binks"

It's been popular to focus on the transmitter comment. Personally, other than as a message of don't look and don't listen to outer space (which confronts all religions, looking at the heavens)... I don't see how that relates much to practical life on Earth in year 2025 / year 2026. I think the issues of how Carol is sent to lesbian reprogramming camp and how Helen her wife doesn't read her book she worked on for 4.5 years is much more about human issues of "opening up" to one another. I do see a metaphor: Moses sends down a message of commandments from outer-space, a hive mind forms, and people send prayers back at Mecca - a massive return signal. Teaching people to be self-aware of their own programming from Quran / Bible / Torah.

More LLM addicts who mock reply, instant blocking, preventing further replies. I see a Reddit tool who gives LLM machines credit for human authoring and human commenting. Very popular since November 2022 on Reddit comment section. Fools who suffer from "The ELIZA effect". This is the new MAGA USA December 2025 warfare technique (dog-whistle USA of "LLM" for immigrant) of "you write English funny, you sound like an immigrant, you should be deported" all over Reddit. Blocking people discussing Pluribus TV show, deport blocking people. All normalized in USA 2025 on Reddit.

"The show has a simple plot." - Finnegans Wake is about media ecology self-awareness of the audience. Being "woke" isn't about the plot. It's about the medium. Marshall McLuhan topics. The Woke / Wake about about a Bible story that says Jesus came back to life, a science fiction story (like Pluribus is a science fiction story). The reply message entirely misses the point of Tim Finnegan being undead. And that Helen's memory is preserved. No human in the real world has ever had their memeories upoaded into a hive mind like Helen did. To Carol, this is a new human experience / a change in life on Earth that the dead are not undead. This person thinks that the topic is about the body of Hellen, the physical, and not the "spirit" and afterlife concepts of science fiction stories by the clergy. Likebeing able to ask the hive mind if Helen liked Carol's unpublished book. This is a very human emotional experience like Church Clergy creates messages from outer-space God, or at least *claims* to.

A HUGE PART of the story... how little Carol asks others and her personal in-home office handwriting of a few scaps and notes and a single white board. Very little direct inquision. She does send output to others, as an author publishing, of her videos... but very little information *gathering*. A huge media ecology topic of input vs. output. Dictating to life, dictating videos, vs listening / gathering / nature feedback (animals encroching on human houses, eating the body).

One month recent Reddit account. Profile of the account has a message about being a block-happy reddit who prizes egoism. Like the hive mind blocking Carol - fleeing Carol. Reddit egoism to have to silence comments to a human person because you can't tolerate someone else's ideas. Calling for censorship, profile that promotes censoring via blocking. A hive mind user of Reddit who makes no comment about the Pluribus TV show storytelling, that is the posting, and the comment is only about their Reddit media concern, not the Vince Gilligan media topic. People are unable to engage serious discussion about Pluribus Reddit hive mind, media ecology, other than deporting (blocking) people that upset the Truth Social MAGA values egoism.

They used very exact counts of dead and size of hive to try and cover that. Some of my GitHub (2nd GitHub GreatSealUSA) or comments here brought up: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/31/earth-population-billions-decline-birthrate-west - it was a news story this year, start of 2025

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1pimwsn/one_assumed_but_not_necessarily_true_detail_about/nt7a9m7/

That's been the core of six episodes and marketing. Very little information, wildcard possibilities in every direction on where the show might go. Aliens controlling the hive, the hive having subconsious / unawareof itself? Some alien vs. alien war that Earth is now dragged into like Luke on his planet opening of "A New Hope"? they are planning 4 seasons of show (many years), a lot of poosibility for story to change scope and characters. Last Man on Earth started with one person, two people, and went all over the place.

Well... well drinks. It's possible to imagine that a creative book writer came up with a self-imposed way to not give up being a pussy-pirate rummy out of Helen's concern. Helen takes the keys at the airport. They have money for airport gift shops, but Carol is too frugal and Helen intervenes with mail-order solutions. Unity married couple, work together, like that. Perhaps Carol didn't want to give up her Joycean book writing heavy drinking mindsets, but Helen came up with the compromise of a technical device to measure BAC in the Range Rover so that they don't argue over "too much" like at the airport arguing. + CopyPasta + Space Pope LLM footer. ++ Regarding the self-imposed driving restrictions... "Maybe they had a close call in the past (you call drinking special)." would be another good one.

So much like Catholic vs. Protestant in Northern Ireland over a science fiction story, The Bible. So much hate agaisnt the idea of "love everyone" stories. A better hive mind than hate vs. hate that Fox News nation / MAGA values Reddit fantatics of Walter White and Saul getting rich poisoning people with addictions in the mind.

The media ecology of the fandom of Vince Gilligan is wilding in hate and anti-learning anti-thinking, so reactionary to turn on humanism and study. Vince at WGA 2025 speech described the USA society was in bad shape, and people just want to keep on that path.

This holiday everyone will talk about the show, new waves of viewers, people who adore asking / writing comments and not researching. This is the society that can't face up to media ecology of national leadership / Fox News HDTV influence because people are so driven by craving low-effort commenting.The people with the talents to create FAQ become territorial and gatekeeping - instead of creating a FAQ and asserting RTFM. The desire to get on the same page / good same pages - like published books about the Pluribus Founding Father ideas... is drowned in desires to write-only commenting. I'm trapped trying to get people to see Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" about this society-wide behavior. I had hopes this TV show would put focus on founding fathers and Latin... we are so anti-FAQ anti-Wiki as a society now. long day.

Hard science discussion on Reddit. Wish it had a link off-Reddit. "Parthenote stem cells are pluripotent stem cells derived from unfertilized egg cells (oocytes)" You LEFT OUT the most important part, the show title! A "bus" of themes about "pluri".  **pluri-potent** - meaning "(of an immature or stem cell) capable of giving rise to several different cell types."  https://www.bedfordresearch.org/stem-cells/stem-cell-research/parthenote-stem-cells/

Dumb drug jokes about Walter White meth are dumb. Praising Walter White and Saul and Elon Musk and Trump as entertainment. Anti-citation, anti book quote, anti-clicking off-reddit at every turn. My username is "bird" and they think cum swalling dose jokes of Carol's eggs or whatever is super-clever like Donald Trump and Epstein poop diaper jokes, pee tape shit (for years and years). The Reddit hive mind since year 2013 thinks pranking people all the time, mocking people, is progress. Eating right out of Cambridge Analytica hands and unable to describe the psycological mechanics and names of the people at CA. An entire nation amused to death, a joke, humiliated by Putin since year 2013.

I quoted a lecture from February 20, 1961. Thinks I am age 17. I even mentioned "The Gratest Generation" in the 2025 lecture from Vince Gilligan in my Reddit posting. Still thinks I am age 17, that's what the kids talk about along with "6 7" and "South Park, right? 1961 lectures that are behind a paywall.
