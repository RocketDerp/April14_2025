Published August 2000: "Howard Bloom's Global Brain argues that life has evolved as a "worldwide learning machine" or "global brain," with each species playing a role in a massive, interconnected system. This isn't a new phenomenon but an evolutionary process dating back to early bacterial colonies, which continued through social animals like spiny lobsters and bees, and is now manifesting in human society and digital networks. The book proposes that culture and society are not just byproducts of individual evolution but are shaped by a "mass mind" that tests ideas through group selection and competition, with technology like the internet being a recent step in this long history.

People watching a TV show for entertainment are very disconnected from the reality of *living that character*. People try to *read* Finnegans Wake, not **EXPERIENCE***. Campbell, The Power Of Myth: "The mystery has been reduced to a set of concepts and ideas, and emphasizing these concepts and ideas can short-circuit the transcendent, connoted experience. An intense experience of mystery is what one has to regard as the ultimate religious experience."

Post-satire, post-irony, satire-poisoning.  The year 1940 film with Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator. It comes to mind in better-written words than my own: "I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness."

At 23 minutes into episode 1, at the Public House bar, the book by James Joyce is introduced by Helen. There is no begin or end to Finnegans Wake, you are thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool. You are not told who the characters are, who is speaking, etc.

Helen then goes into the parking lot, opens LOL social media, and falls backwards and cracks her head like Tim Finnegan.

Finnegans Wake is the most powerful book ever created by humanity about media ecology. It is a slap in the audience face in episode 1. It ends the whole world. This story is about a **book author and a book publisher, married Helen and Carol.**

Every writer / athlete / publisher has some injury or excuse why they are not first palce - but simple reality is in a world of over 8 billion people - how maby can actually BE number 1. The maths of household names and maths of ranking "best". You will see TV show fandom constantly saying x show deserved all these awards. The math does not check out. There is a lacking of counting of media ecology. Some books are written that are not understood or appreciated for decades. Until a farmer digs them up during World War Two in Egypt....

A media addict who doesn't care if Trump and Putin rule the world and The Lord of the Rings inspires people to join Sauron. That the media clergy of science fiction (Bible is science fiction) teaches equality of good and evil and choose whichever you wish.

I think the real world is proving the Skywalker Ranch 1985 / 1986 / 1987 lessons correct that were filmed by George Lucas. Published in 1988, "The Power Of Myth".

Notable that Bill Moyers worked staff in the White House, studied the meaning of Pluribus. He isn't just any interviewer.

BILL MOYERS: No, but given the absence of initiation rituals, which have largely disappeared from our society, the world of imagination as projected on that screen serves, even if in a faulty way, to tell that story, doesn’t it?

CAMPBELL: Yes, but what is unfortunate for us is that a lot of the **people who write these stories do not have the sense of their responsibility.** These stories are making and breaking lives. But the movies are made simply to make money. The kind of **responsibility that goes into a priesthood** with a ritual is not there. That is one of our problems today.

BILL MOYERS: We have none of those rites today, do we?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I’m afraid we don’t. So the youngsters invent them themselves, and you have **these raiding gangs**, and so forth — that is self-rendered initiation.

New Mexico where prop guns / prop weapons are confused on book authoring movie sets. New Mexico where you invite an Africa stranger into your house, booze up and pop heavy pills, and play with guns. New Mexico where you attack an African in front of your house and kill millions with the butterfly effect. Drunken wild west indeepndence. On the frontier, Carol's house of airport world wide pirate book publication, right next to the untamed frontier. Going wilding. New Mexico, where satire-washing and amusement-washing and entertainment-washing of the cancer health care crisis / meth drug crisis / loaded proop weapon crisis / boozing crisis / egomania crisis.... /s satire.

Yes. Murdering 13 for greater good. Automobile wrecks alone kill way more than that. People dangerous with machines, like Carol thinks loaded guns are a toy to play with while drunk in her house... pointing it to an African immigrant she disagrees with.

Yep. ant hills are natural. Poison plants are natural. The show says zoo animals interaction issues to raise this point. This show is (not only) about creating genetic engineered life, rewriting nature.

Bingo. Carol is baiting a trap for her enemy. The audience is drowning in sarcasm / satire in USA society. If Carol does not trust the hive mind, why invite it into her house for drinks. When you invite someone into your home office for drinks ih the middle of the night and put a loaded gun on the table... and you attempt a murder/suicide...

https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1oyz3dt/1x03_survival_instinct/np88qms/

The previous mocking user blocked, so I can't reply. A mock and block tactic that prevents any reply in the thread, even to other people.

Finnegans Wake at 23 minutes into Episode One of Pluribus... the Tower of Babel conflicts.

https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1oyu3ik/1x03_blows_the_lid_wide_open_on_story_potential/np76bkt/

Yes. Sarcasm does not excuse taking a loaded weapon and pointing it at someone and dong murder-suicide. Carol is deathy afraid of the hive mind, and plays dumb that they would not give a rael Air Force One or a real loaded gun.

https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1ozi8lg/i_told_my_son_about_the_show_and_he_had_a_theory/npbor8i/

The technology change to Earth / humans is massive. So many misunderstandings and poor information has been recognized. Having framed it as invasive / alien / disease - a cure is now to keep the best of the changes and restore what people like Carol prize. It is still early in the show, and what may seem stable in the values and hive behavior may be infiltrated / temporary stage. It has always bothered me that people don't recognize the entertainmennt addiction of Star Wars and Star Trek alawys havig wars / enemy. Like the universe never escapes humnan hate. A dog that attacks and always prizes hate would be put to death in many Earth culutres. But Rupert Murdoch people who prize hate and attack other groups of humans is treated as normal. Ad evolving technology to Star Wars level of blowing up entire planets with weapon systems is considred progress of humanity. MLK Jr even talked about breaking the chain of hate for the entire universe. Boy, that would be hard to sell as entertaining to audiences, but it isn't an unknown human ideal. ... ... ...        
"And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe."

Another example of an audience member who thinks that the story is not highlighting human behaviros. Humans who create guns, humans in New Mexico who create nuclear bombs (which Carol brings up at end of episode). Carl Sagan's January 1994. "**An extraterrestrial being, newly arrived on Earth -- scrutinizing** what we mainly present to our children in TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, the comics and many books -- might easily conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape, cruelty, superstition and consumerism." https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1994/01/09/with-science-on-our-side/9e5d2141-9d53-4b4b-aa0f-7a6a0faff845/ - the metaphors of how EASY we have made bomb delivery and HOW HARD we have made dialog outside English / Spanish for Carol. How alien the idea of solving problems as much as we are motivated to "play" with booze and weapons. The subconsious revenge desires. How there is no clergy on demand, yoga on demand, but ambulace for bombing each other. The death-wishing and weapon-system creation that humanity prizes. The mockery we make of Malala and MLK Jr and others who try to actually enage society mass dehumanization. Where are the mental health workers engaging Putin's society since Februarhy 2014 as they attack Ukraine?

I think this is one of the reasons billionaires have invested so much in artificial intelligence that can do video. Wealthy people will be able to have shows rewritten for them. "Dear A.I. machine, show me Pluribus with all the boring parts I don't desire removed and edited out".

There is huge demand out there for people slashing out all the stuff they don't like. Or replacing actors they don't like, any egoism people desire.

reference: "Topher Grace's fan edit of the Star Wars prequels, which he condensed into a single 85-minute film. This was an unauthorized fan edit that re-edited the three prequel movies into a single narrative, removing plot points like Jar Jar Binks"

It's been popular to focus on the transmitter comment. Personally, other than as a message of don't look and don't listen to outer space (which confronts all religions, looking at the heavens)... I don't see how that relates much to practical life on Earth in year 2025 / year 2026. I think the issues of how Carol is sent to lesbian reprogramming camp and how Helen her wife doesn't read her book she worked on for 4.5 years is much more about human issues of "opening up" to one another. I do see a metaphor: Moses sends down a message of commandments from outer-space, a hive mind forms, and people send prayers back at Mecca - a massive return signal. Teaching people to be self-aware of their own programming from Quran / Bible / Torah.

More LLM addicts who mock reply, instant blocking, preventing further replies. I see a Reddit tool who gives LLM machines credit for human authoring and human commenting. Very popular since November 2022 on Reddit comment section. Fools who suffer from "The ELIZA effect". This is the new MAGA USA December 2025 warfare technique (dog-whistle USA of "LLM" for immigrant) of "you write English funny, you sound like an immigrant, you should be deported" all over Reddit. Blocking people discussing Pluribus TV show, deport blocking people. All normalized in USA 2025 on Reddit.

"The show has a simple plot." - Finnegans Wake is about media ecology self-awareness of the audience. Being "woke" isn't about the plot. It's about the medium. Marshall McLuhan topics. The Woke / Wake about about a Bible story that says Jesus came back to life, a science fiction story (like Pluribus is a science fiction story). The reply message entirely misses the point of Tim Finnegan being undead. And that Helen's memory is preserved. No human in the real world has ever had their memories uploaded into a hive mind like Helen did. To Carol, this is a new human experience / a change in life on Earth that the dead are not undead. This person thinks that the topic is about the body of Helen, the physical, and not the "spirit" and afterlife concepts of science fiction stories by the clergy. Like being able to ask the hive mind if Helen liked Carol's unpublished book. This is a very human emotional experience like Church Clergy creates messages from outer-space God, or at least *claims* to.

A HUGE PART of the story... how little Carol asks others and her personal in-home office handwriting of a few scaps and notes and a single white board. Very little direct inquision. She does send output to others, as an author publishing, of her videos... but very little information *gathering*. A huge media ecology topic of input vs. output. Dictating to life, dictating videos, vs listening / gathering / nature feedback (animals encroching on human houses, eating the body).

One month recent Reddit account. Profile of the account has a message about being a block-happy reddit who prizes egoism. Like the hive mind blocking Carol - fleeing Carol. Reddit egoism to have to silence comments to a human person because you can't tolerate someone else's ideas. Calling for censorship, profile that promotes censoring via blocking. A hive mind user of Reddit who makes no comment about the Pluribus TV show storytelling, that is the posting, and the comment is only about their Reddit media concern, not the Vince Gilligan media topic. People are unable to engage serious discussion about Pluribus Reddit hive mind, media ecology, other than deporting (blocking) people that upset the Truth Social MAGA values egoism.

They used very exact counts of dead and size of hive to try and cover that. Some of my GitHub (2nd GitHub GreatSealUSA) or comments here brought up: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/31/earth-population-billions-decline-birthrate-west - it was a news story this year, start of 2025

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1pimwsn/one_assumed_but_not_necessarily_true_detail_about/nt7a9m7/

That's been the core of six episodes and marketing. Very little information, wildcard possibilities in every direction on where the show might go. Aliens controlling the hive, the hive having subconsious / unawareof itself? Some alien vs. alien war that Earth is now dragged into like Luke on his planet opening of "A New Hope"? they are planning 4 seasons of show (many years), a lot of poosibility for story to change scope and characters. Last Man on Earth started with one person, two people, and went all over the place.

Well... well drinks. It's possible to imagine that a creative book writer came up with a self-imposed way to not give up being a pussy-pirate rummy out of Helen's concern. Helen takes the keys at the airport. They have money for airport gift shops, but Carol is too frugal and Helen intervenes with mail-order solutions. Unity married couple, work together, like that. Perhaps Carol didn't want to give up her Joycean book writing heavy drinking mindsets, but Helen came up with the compromise of a technical device to measure BAC in the Range Rover so that they don't argue over "too much" like at the airport arguing. + CopyPasta + Space Pope LLM footer. ++ Regarding the self-imposed driving restrictions... "Maybe they had a close call in the past (you call drinking special)." would be another good one.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE).

My reply to this comment, emphasizing Finnegans Wake and Carol being the ONLY ONE who is English as first language. The world-choice lecture Carol gave about meaning of "cold" drink bottle. Eggs stored on ice, ice bed with Helen, drinking cocktails... lots of cold drink metaphors in the show. "Carol probed if she could get a room at the West Gate to keep talking and passed it off as a joke. She isn't just going to gas stations and probing if they will get her cold drinks and their language usage." ++ And  another thing...

I've **been relucant to write it**, but now that I have introduced the idea of "probing commands" to the hive mind about the gas station drone drink delivery coldness. Probing for a hotel room at West Gate and saying it was only sarcasm (the whole issue of "sarcasm" over the loaded weapon home delivery murder/suicide of a Islamic Africa immigrant)... "Butt-pirate" is assoicated with homosexual sex. And popular science fiction film (R rated) with pirate-leg "pegging" https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/02/102804/ryan-reynolds-deadpool-review-full-frontal-nudity - so "pegging" / "peg leg" pirates and metaphors of "butt pirates" for anal sex. Which leads to **alien invasion stories** about probing the Human Body. Like probing for *stem cells* inside the body causing pain discussed in Episode Six. So now Episode Seven - Carol is probing hostility towards commandments on precise cold drink delivery. She is probing... "butt-priate" / Peg leg / Pirate Lady / Carol being a Pirate story creator. Aleins doing anal probes. Young CHILDREN getting anal probes is USA headline / title: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartman_Gets_an_Anal_Probe

You didn't read my message correctly, some kind of time-shift comprehension issue.

My entire point was that the audience watching the show sees the title "Pluribus" that Carol and nobody else sees. Out of band audience clues. The ICE hotel / flashing northern police lights scene was years and years earlier.


After the Zero Hour, I do not recall any depiction that Carol has thought about her eggs as a source of the stem cells for the hive mind to create a takeover of her body / biology / forced conversion to the hive mind (like her forced interment in a "camp" at age 16 by Christian parents)

The science fiction audience lessons from Luke Skywalker Ranch, published in year 1988, filmed by George Lucas:

"Now, I came to this idea of bliss **because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world**, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat, Chit, Ananda. The word “Sat” means being. “Chit” means consciousness. “Ananda” means bliss or rapture. I thought, “I don’t know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don’t know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being.” I think it worked." - 1988, The Power of Myth

"It is the religious practice of voluntarily fasting to death by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids." ... "It is not considered a suicide by Jain scholars because it is not an act of passion, nor does it employ poisons or weapons." ...

My reply:

I agree this is one of the things the show is demonstrating. There are conclusions that seem hive-mind thought out, such as declaring that Kepler world is probably dead already and pay-it-forward to other civilizations has been the choice of the Earth hive mind as opposed to being concerned with a reply message to the sender (see also: Three Body Problem Chinese science fiction reply message).

&nbsp;

Carol: So, what are the people like on Kepler-22b?     
Zosia: We'll probably never learn the first thing about them. They're too far away. But we know we love them. And we're grateful to them. And we'll pay it forward, however long that may take.     
Carol: What does that mean?    
Zosia: We have to share their gift. With whoever else might be out there.

&nbsp;

>  It rewrote some brain genes so that all minds communicated instantly over a radio frequency. And when all brains communicated and linked up, this is the result.

1. Classical ideas of school and teaching are eliminated. At the Air Fore One lunch gathering... Carol demonstrates that the hive mind child Ravi has adult knowledge.

2. All spoken / written language skills are accessible. Favoring non-satire non-sarcasm but a kind of legal technicalities focus on language. With the Christmas Day Eve ending of the season, I would assert the context of Genesis 11:7 idea of humanity from science fiction stories { Torah, Bible }. The Tower of Babel. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel

3. Context of { Kepler 22, Minute 22} Episode One... Helen in a [*Public House*](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Irish+Public+House) delivers the world-ending post-doctorate thesis of all times: James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book, Finn's Hotel year 1923. This is given as advice to Carol about happiness and fandoms. There is microphone tapping, and [both liberated lesbian women go outside to smoke a cigarette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom) - Carol with her virgin lungs. This is the Zero Hour of the countdown, on top of [the grave site of Walter White](https://old.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1osq6ci/pluribus_s01e01_has_an_obscure_tie_to_both_bb_and/) in ABQ.

Lots more.

> The core premise of the show (as I see it, admittedly) is what if humanity changed?

Carol being a boozer to change and alter her mind is a key theme of the story. Like Walter White's substance chemistry lab work. 

* “Very similar to the Latin aqua vitae, literally 'water of life,' which becomes the Scandinavian aquavit” - Hive Mind  via Zosia

Which points us back at Kepler 22 signaling of Minute 22 in the Public House. A story of an undead man who isn't dead. Merry Christmas / Resurrection stories are human origin. Boozing Carol has the bottle of life giving always handy.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdizZtOddC8

Helen's post-doctorate thesis is the most amazing scene in Western culture. The "TLDR" *of a  western world cultural lifetime*!

> What is "Helen's post-doctorate thesis"?

Minute 22, at the Zero Hour (Kepler "22"). Pilot episode.

Helen's post-doctorate thesis to Carol is in a bar, a public house, to say James Joyce's Finnegans Wake has the answers to your unpublished book, "Bitter Chrysalis". Her thesis is that even if only one person in the entire world is *made happy* then it is a different category of art.

Like commercial art vs. religious art category. The most amazing thesis delivery ever! Short, to the point, and entirely true to James Joyce's work.

A similar post-doctorate thesis from a professor at University of Toronto: 

* "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

&nbsp;

The entire theme of the show is around the concept of making *one single person not be the most miserable in the world*, Helen's spouse.

> Seriously, why does it feel like people gloss over the fact that our own government caused all of this?

I witness all over the fandom. Just as I witness people ignoring the Air Force One symbolism of Carol assembling command and control defenses (and standing next to the POTUS Seal).

It's very surprising to me how almost nobody brings up a military virus leak story about the USA military doing lab experiments: The Stand by Stephen King. One of the most famous science fiction creators in human history! Especially with all the { book author, book publicist, book tour, book store } opening of the show, Stephen King is a natural connection to the story!

> our own government caused all of this?

Our own New Mexico VLA on the Plains of San Agustin. Further, Vegas location, Fallout Vegas, and **The Stand** with Carol's request for an atomic bomb (made in New Mexico, USA). I mean, The Stand had two different television series and the book too! Do people not get all the ICE bed...

[Year 1988 "Power of Myth"](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/) filmed by George Lucas, lessons for science fiction (Star Wars / Hollywood) fandoms:


&nbsp;

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: **Women are booty, they are goods**. With the fall of a city, every woman in the city would be raped.

BILL MOYERS: There’s this ethical contradiction mentioned in your book, quoting Exodus: “Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife—except abroad. Then you should put all males to the sword, and the women you shall take as booty to yourself.” That’s right out of the Old Testament.

CAMPBELL: Deuteronomy. Those are fierce passages.

MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?

CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.

Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.

MOYERS: Because when you substitute the male for the female, you get a different psychology,

"making the case"  about the Founding Fathers of the United States of America and their specific use of Latin language. It's right in the titel of my posting?

That's why it is in drawings (symbols) and Latin language. The 1988 book "Power of Myth" explains the eagle symbol / pyramid symbol / Latin meaning. The book is what I keep pointing to. The book makes perfect sense. Sarah Lawrence College professor with White House communications director Bill Moyers. George Lucas filmed it before it was printed in a book on paper.

Reading, on paper, a book from year 1988. It explains the Latin and themes of the Pluribus Apple TV+ show of December 2025.

Anti-book. My reply:

> you replied with something that again makes no sense

I can only do so much about Carol's book publishing, book writing, book tour, and the "plebs" at the book store that read her pirate romance fiction stories. Literacy isn't universal, We Is Us, doesn't always work for people who author comments. Helen understood that with her Finnegans Wake assertion at minute 22 in episode one. 

Have a great Christmas, I'm looking forward to Episode Nine and the story of Carol the book author and her Chapter 2 drafting.

*They are* bombing the entire planet with an infection / disease / biological warfare (from a USA military lab, Episode One / Pilot Episode)  to tell her what to eat and how to speak as "We" instead of "I".

Reading a book isn't the same as taking a book seriously or comprehending or understanding. Like MAGA USA December 2025 who celebrates The Bible book for Christmas while cheering on { Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Donald Trump } billionaires. They wave around and celebrate Jesus the character from a science fiction book without reading or comprehending Bible page "1 John 3:17" about D.O.G.E. cutting of helping poor people by the rich billionaires. The anti-comprehension anti-understanding of MAGA USA Fox News fandom nation. My reply:

> I've read the book and I don't understand

I've read the book since I got it in year 1988, at least a dozen times. The TV show Pluribus is all called out in the book. Vince Gilligan on February 15, 2025 mentioned "Darth Vader" in his writers guild speech.

&nbsp;

> I've read the book and I don't understand

"The fact that the evil power is not identified with any specific nation on this earth means you’ve got an abstract power, which represents a principle, not a specific historical situation. The story has to do with an operation of principles, not of this nation against that. The monster masks that are put on people in Star Wars represent the real monster force in the modern world. When the mask of Darth Vader is removed, you see an unformed man, one who has not developed as a human individual. What you see is a strange and pitiful sort of undifferentiated face." - Skywaker Ranch, California. 1988 book "Power of Myth"

&nbsp;

"The monster masks that are put on people in Star Wars represent the real monster force in the modern world" - the *pronoun* mask (and anti-pronoun masks) people put ion with "Pirate Lady" / "Pirate Man" represents the real monster force in the modern USA nation.

&nbsp;

"Darth Vader has not developed his own humanity. He’s a robot. He’s a bureaucrat, living not in terms of himself but in terms of an imposed system. This is the threat to our lives that we all face today. Is the system going to flatten you out " - George Lucas filming lessons for science fiction fandoms, published in the book "Power of Myth" 1988

&nbsp;

"in terms of an imposed system. This is the threat to our lives that we all face today." - that is what Carol is facing to the hive mind. A alien system imposed about ABQ, with an enemy Pirate Lady facing her as we approach Episode Nine on Christmas Eve / Christmas Day.

The "It", "He", "She" Latin of Christmas Day forces and the assertion of American New Mexico independence against the imposing hive mind.

> Can you answer in like 5 words?

This is not a "ELI3", "ELI5" story. Vince Gilligan and his writing staff made this clear with minute 22 of Episode One (the Pluribus Pilot) and dialog about Finnegans Wake. That scene between Helen and Carol is also in the 1988 book. Helen and Carol discuss writing for "the plebs" fandom and doing reveals on social media before Helen falls backwards an dies (hitting her head).

&nbsp;

"Then it becomes a set of theological works in which everything is reduced to a code, to a creed." - 1988 book "Power of Myth" describing the Pluribus hive mind behaviors, story points of season one of this Apple TV+ show.

My reply:

> Sorry but what are you talking about with down votes and stuff? I'm a long time redditer but new to some new stuff

Learning and education about media systems drives a lot of conflicts. Fox News Audience vs. MSNBC audience, for example. Different "hive minds" and "alternate universes" (or from "another planet" like Kepler 22B).

&nbsp;

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”
― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.

“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.”
― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

&nbsp;

> what are you talking about with down votes and stuff? I'm a long time redditer but new to some new stuff

"Downvote-disagree" hive mind behaviors. Piling on down votes because television show audiences don't like book stores and book reading (Carol and Helen). On space topics, outer-space such as Kepler 22B VLA New Mexico, it has been discussed here on Reddit.

That was covered in minute 22 of Pluribus Episode One. Carol takes up smoking for the first time, even if you don't smoke directly, there is a concept of "second hand smoke" and the peer pressure to drink booze (Helen is pressured by Carol to take a  Taxi and booze up with her at the public house).

People are unable to understand these elements of the story about a book author, book publisher, book tour, and Helen's statement at the Zero Hour countdown.

Both women step outdoors and burn the world down. Lady liberty, statue of liberty flames in hand. Helen, being the person who understood the point James Joyce was making in Finn's Hotel year 1923 - fell and cracked her skull like Tim. This flies right over the heads of second screen audiences on Apple iPad / iPhone devices. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom  Easter Sunday, 1929. Helen and Carol and "second hand smoking" of Carol's virgin lungs. March 31, 1929 and how it relates to the season ending with Carol's frozen eggs on ice... and December 24 / December 25 fertilization from an outer-space message. The two ladies smoking, influencers, "second hand smoke" of even PBS being influenced by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. It's a rich and deep topic, Finn's Hotel year 1923 Dublin writings.

I didn't want to make the interrogation quiz too long, so **I left out "5. Do you consider Hans Christian Andersen's 1838 story The Storks about baby conception** to be fiction or non-fiction?". Anyway, my reply:: 

> Sorry not biting the conspiracy tale

We are dealing with "Pluribus", a fiction story published on Apple TV+ and clearly labeled as science fiction.

When I see a response like this from a Reddit cloud computing user, I tend to quiz their intelligence about science fiction storytelling influence on society. It helps a lot to establish the meaning of English wordchoice.

1. Saturday October 7, 2023 - Palestine Quran terrorism day. Do you know this is Putin's birthday? or not? (I've lived in Palestine lands in Jordan for the Arab Spring after relocation from Africa before)

2. Do you believe the Bible is non-fiction or fiction storytelling? 

3. Do you consider "Truth Social" media network to be fiction or non-fiction?

4. Do you consider Santa Claus to be a fiction or non-fiction story?

Given this show ends on December 24 / December 25 and is about a woman who is going to produce a child (frozen eggs / stem cells) without having a male impregnating *her*. We are deep into a particular kind of baby-conception storytelling.

Again, do you consider The Bible fiction or non-fiction storytelling? As a lot of Americans seem incredibly confused on this comprehension / understanding of literacy / book reading. Many (age 21 and over) people in USA think Santa is science fiction, yet can't see the *influence of Santa storytelling* on society behavior.

Allah / Yahweh / "The Word" (John 1:1 meme metaphors) of creativity is most documented science fiction character, maybe. But the Upanishads give that a run for the money.

what mental breakdown? I'm doing deconstruction breakdown of the Pluribus Apple TV+ *science fiction* story / show.

Do you think Jesus is real? Do you hear Christmas Jesus speaking to you? You a big "fan" of Jesus stories?

My reply:

> I think it’s Carol’s form of MAD. They refused to stop work on her eggs

She can shock the hive, they both know how to do it now.

The hive should be developing defenses against emotional shock. Hardening their global neural network. Instead, they are focused on the 13 people (counting down, Peru woman now joined).

The story as it is being told does not exist if they hive isn't incredibly obsessed with the 13 free people. As if it is programmed to view them as a key to their own plan.

It is Christmas Eve Day. Ask yourself, why have a switch in Eden. Carol has said twice now that they won't pluck an apple. Why does the Torah /  Bible / Quran science fiction trilogy have an apple tree in the first place?

It is part of plan of the universe to give mankind free will. Repeating: Why isn't the hive mind developing defense against the emotional shocks that crash the neural network? Why are they so concerned for 13 people they could imprison or kill. 

Again, Christmas Eve, there is only ONE animal in Eden planet that switches the Apple plucking button to nuke Eden.

I think that's the heart of the story we are getting.

Vince Gilligan's marketing campaign for the story was very serious. About world misery and the monster society. Calling social media a cesspool at the start of the year and taking on the inspirational elements of his Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fandoms.

**MAGA Trump in office a second time around** provides the level of constant drama and stimulation people have normalized now. No goodness leader emerges because goodness doesn't stimulate like meth Walter White stimulates. Carol is depicted as waking up dropping her bottle from the couch after vodka, not meth ambitions. Book writing, book touring, book storytelling, airport book arranging / sorting. As Campbell said, it's already there. "And then comes an interesting thing, just as in the Old Testament — all we have heard is **the story of this particular group**, the Navaho, let’s say. But when they come out, **the Pueblo people are already there**. It’s like the problem of where did Adam’s sons get their wives? There is the creation of these people, and the rest of the world is somehow there by another accident." ... ... ... "Each needs its own myth, all the way. Love thine enemy. Open up. Don’t judge.

The entire posting, this comment is by the creator of the posting. [Carl (Carol) Sagan wrote a book about social media in 1995, Science as a Candle book, where he described electric media consumers as "Celebration of Ignorance" - television fandoms of "Dumb and Dumber.](../Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md) My reply:

>  that one is possible, but I would say it would be better to get the science figured out first, translate it after. And yes - I’m nitpicking a TV show.

Let's start from the very top of the show

1. Book store, book selling

2. Book fandom

3. Book signing

4. Book tour

5. Book author

6. Wife of a book publicist / book promoter

7. Airport on the way home, they re-arrange the order of books on display

8. After the book tour ends.. they go to a public house for drinks and smokes and discuss an unpublished book "Bitter Chrysalis"

9. Wife talks about graduate school at a university where the most difficult book ever created in all human history is discussed. At the Zero Hour of the countdown, a specific book - the most legendary book in modern times. The world ends.

10. Author character, protagonist, is depicted at a swimming pool reading a book by Ursula K. Le Guin

11. Author character, protagonist, is depicted reading a book before going to bed. Agatha Christie

12. Author is depicted writing a new book. Draft of chapter one, and interacting with a worldwide fandom of the book.

I would make the bold assertion: this is a television story that is making a point about reading, books, writing, Gutenberg printing press, etc. It also seems to make a point about recording video and mailing them out to strangers.

1. I would say it would be better to trust people who say you can have gasoline than put it into your mouth. It is highly toxic

2. I would say it would be better to hitch-hike and trust a stranger for a ride in a car or a flying machine than grind like life is a video game of avoiding human contact.

3. I would say it is better to love and forgive your mother and be glad she is alive, even if she got a disease like dementia or Alzheimer's and lost her mind. Better than calling your mother a collection of horrible words

4. When Carol, who steals police cars, says in dialog in front of the audience that you have odd set of values stealing an ambulance... maybe the writers of a story are trying to make a point.

5. When you don't trust any packaged or canned food anywhere except from your own personal stash or cans of dog food from your own familiar storage unit - but think every grocery store and person you encounter is out to poison you and only you - that you eat dog food from a can...

6. I would say if you have to park your car, burning it with gasoline in a ritual fashion seems destructive and damaging to the environment and a dozen other points I won't write on a Reddit comment very few people will read because my comment isn't "TlDR", "ELI4".

7. I would say a modern smartphone can translate English to other languages and that the main character made this point while standing under a pink umbrella. Even in offline mode, humanity has created tools like ham radios in a "Radio Shack" and translation tools.

I could go on, but I've already spent over 25 minutes thinking and composing this Reddit reply.

* "Religious masochism involves finding spiritual meaning or benefit in self-inflicted suffering, pain, or humiliation, often through practices like extreme fasting, self-flagellation, or intense guilt, to achieve spiritual purification, express devotion, atone for sin, or emulate Christ, though it can also manifest as psychological obsession with transgression (scrupulosity) or theological frameworks that glorify powerlessness. It bridges psychological concepts of finding pleasure or purpose in pain with religious motivations"

Maybe a story about the last man on earth based on The Twilight Zone is making a point about books?  Maybe a point about people's values at the end of the world concerning books? Maybe how some books are considered perfect and all other books are considered errors and imperfect? And you would end such a story season on Christmas Eve Day holiday season, about one of the most legendary science fiction books of all mankind? The Bible book? A story about an alien who invades Earth and gets a virgin pregnant...

Or, maybe book is mentioned every single episode.... inspired by Twilight Zone... "That famous Twilight Zone episode is "Time Enough at Last," featuring bookish bank teller Henry Bemis (played by Burgess Meredith), who survives a nuclear apocalypse"

This TV series has made book authoring, book writing, book touring, bull publishing, book reading, book fandom from the opening. Yet, people flock to the lowest quality most superficial learning about this show. Vince Gilligan has a message to the audience that people on social meme sites just don't seem to be getting.

> The show is just so boring they had to add something that’s SEEMS exciting but it’s stupid.

Apple computers / Apple TV insisted they *spice up* (like salting a nuke with [Cobalt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13QdIdEblxk)) the ending that was previously going to be more cerebral. 

"Smith and the rest of the writers room did not know they were setting up an ominous punchline in the finale by having Carol escalate matters to the nuclear option. As mentioned, they have a plan for the **A-bomb** going forward, but making good on it was a late addition during the start of the finale’s production. The **revised objective, in conversation with Apple TV, was to leave audiences on a show-stopping cliffhanger**, as opposed to the more low-key team-up that was originally planned for Carol and Manousos"

> The show is just so boring they had to add something that’s SEEMS exciting but it’s stupid.

I think it's a very deep show about how audiences interact with a story about lesbian women who have power. The book store opening, book tour, book authoring, book writing, book reading, book publishing themes. Helen delivers a post-doc thesis about the purpose of books at the Zero Hour in the public house that most people seem to have not grasped the depth of. 

> If Carol detonates a Nuke, she kills herself 

Carol seems more like the drunk diving self-harm type. At least she lets the hive mind fly the airplanes and helicopters for her.

* "The **great radio telescopes of the world** are constructed in remote locations for the same reason Paul Gauguin sailed to Tahiti: For them to work well, they must be far from civilization. As civilian and military radio traffic has increased, radio telescopes had to hide — sequestered in an obscure valley in Puerto Rico, say, or exiled to a **vast scrub desert in New Mexico** or Kazakhstan. As radio interference continues to grow, it makes increasing sense to build the telescopes off the Earth altogether. The scientists who work at these isolated observatories tend to be dogged and determined. **Spouses abandon** them" - [Contact is a **1985 hard science** fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_\(novel\))

"typically high-proof vodkas, reaching up to 95-96% ABV (190-192 proof) with brands like Spirytus or Everclear (though Everclear faces state restrictions). For rum, "overproof" varieties push well past standard 40%, with common bottlings hitting 75.5% ABV (151 proof) (like the discontinued Bacardi 151) and some special or artisanal rums exceeding 80% ABV, sometimes reaching into the mid-80s."

There are multiple circle-jerk / mockery communities on Reddit for the show. In general the fandom of Breaking Band and Better Call Saul can't see the book tour, book authoring, book reading, book selling aspects of the show. This behavior has elevated Donald Trump anti-comprehension entertainment to the top of society for over a decade. Bad guys are considered entertaining and desirable if they make a mockery of comprehension and meaning. Fox News audience is convinced that billionaires need even more money. The attraction to ignorance isn't just one TV show, it's the very leadership of the nation now and has been for a long time.

A lesbian married couple and lesbian lover scene in MAGA USA 2025 people are masking all their Trump programming by saying "bad quality". The show is about books, books, books, and people complain that nothing is happening. This is like trying to get a Fox News audience to see the problem with the "action news" of hate messaging that they have. The idea that aliens have to be the ones to bring world peace seems lost on so many audience members who want to gang up and attack other audience members. That's Newsmax, Fox News, Truth Social, that's what Trump the role model is doing with Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert and women! Trump said Rosie O'Donnell was a national security threat!

My comment, as I'm putting it here in context with the Pluribus TV show and the USA founding fathers hive mind concepts. A year 2013 discussion on Reddit about fiction (science fiction) video game content and violence inspiration. People keep wanting to act like the evidence isn't clear that fiction outsells nonfiction and people all around them are influenced by fiction storytelling networks (organized fiction) like Rupert Murdoch's Fox News HDTV. You can't measure what is inside a person's brain, but you can see people develop common fiction attractions from sources. Such as during the pandemic, the popularity of fiction stories about "horse paste dewormer" (Ivermectin) curing COVID-2019 virus. People do not independently study these treatments, people consume *the same fiction stories* like video games and entertainment Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" fiction (Fox News entertainment news fiction taken as nonfiction factual). ... ... ...       

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

A serious comment! My reply to this message:

My answer:

1. It means that Vince Gilligan is very serious in targeting Social Media Behaviors. Including White House *Truth Social*.

2. Look at Minute 37 of Episode Two (which came out with the Pilot Episode). There are 4 stars missing on the POTUS Seal and the eagle is pointing the wrong way ("PLURIBUS" Latin langauge on Seal) on Air Force One.  People here are ignoring this extremely important detail that  **4 stars are missing of 13 stars**, the 13 free thinking individuals outside the hive mind.

Helen was thrown backwards because she was using a wireless phone device, a touch screen device, with [social media](https://youtu.be/TkteSxVIM1A?t=648). Helen was touching the third-rail of USA society topics; trans-gender at the "00:00:00:00" singularity of countdown time.

Notice the one infected person standing behind the bar with the traditional **telephone, landline**, not the touch wireless phone like Helen... is still standing fine, not blown away (from the social media touch screen) by the wireless device like Helen was....

The emphasis on the Radio Shack man and [his Ham Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOGWbaOOeCM) kit  / Storage Unit Manager (old school tech like VHS tapes) is all about wireless... and they tell Carol that wireless is down and use land lines / cable TV.

My reply to this message, go deeper on media ecology:

> Who did Helen interact with? Only Carol.

There are traces of real-wold dinner locations ... "Remember your trip to The Inn at Little Washington, fall of 1998? They served that pepper bacon you still talk about. We flew it in for you. And your favorite crispy brioche from Les Crayères." (France)

I've done a lot of travel in this world, and I see a story with deep footprints. They are making a point to go back to "the fall" of 1998 (Finnegans Wake is all about the Fall, Helen's fall backwards, Tim's ladder fall - in this Reddit thread reply context).

I was reviewing my comments for activity and replies I might have missed. And this is some of the weirdest shit I've seen. Huge activity on this account by the numbers... but after posting Pluribus topics they deleted every comment and posting on their account. They were really getting abused by the Breaking Bad / Better Call Saul fandom.

I think with the encoding of the show, and opening message of "decode space signal into biological change RNA"... that this weekend I finally came to terms and analyzed the Minute 37 Episode Two POTUS Seal closely. 4 stars are missing, the eagle is turned the opposite way, and the olive branch and arrows are swapped so that the obvious meaning of "war over peace" isn't changed. Those background Air Force One screens I assume can't be filmed in camera, so are post-production. 

* "Department of War" was authorized as a secondary title for the Department of Defense (DoD) on September 5, 2025

Again, I am saying this is NOT the more obvious emphasis that they *could have* gone for that more people are educated to look for. But 4 of the 13 stars are missing, only 9 of the 13 appear. It really took me until yesterday Sunday, December 28, 2025 to review old Reddit activity and play with Google Search to see that I can't find anyone else who has noted this difference. I only dropped hits of it way back at Episode One + Episode 2 air time. November 7, 2025 - and when I opened a new posting on it after the final Episode 9 on Reddit, nobody took it seriously.

I'm going to repeat myself: This is a show that OPENS with a bunch of scientists / university educated people trying to make meaning of symbols and codes. Code-breaking and symbolism are the very theme of the show. Add on top that Carol emphasizes at the zero hour "00:00:00:00" that *graduate school* work on James Joyce Finnegans Wake is difficult... and the general slower pace low-octane engagement of the show. It is like more about a married lesbian woman and her sex and domestic life than any raging alien invasion story. It feels *domestic* coded as a show, she flies normal coach in airline, she goes to Sprouts (which I personally shopped at at times when I lived in Austin Texas), her house is modest subdivision. Her trips favorite food places are not that outrageous, especially since she works at home and could declare trips as business expenses if she did some book related promoting.

Dual income, no kids, DINK. Not hurting for money. Established in life, not n her first book, but established. Already put in 4.5 years on a book that didn't earn a single penny of income and helped her write off expenses on taxes. We are talking dedicated labor: "plugging away at it for five years". She has the money and living within her financial means. Not starting off at book one when she had to steal office supplies for her first book.

Again, again, again like Finnegans Wake page 628 you go back to iterate page 3. This is a slow-burning TV show that is about cerebral slow-burning spending 4.5 years on a draft copy of a book... zero time spent on holidays with family, how has custom build for white boards, a lot of *do as you please* in this character Carol. And the show OPENS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHY DECODING OF MEDIA MESSAGES.

People ignoring the Air Force One Symbolism with the eagle beak holding the word "Pluribus" in it is shocking. The audience can't focus on a slow-burning Latin language show. But i guarantee you who isn't ignoring this show because of my GitHub - Putin / Kremlin / NSA / Intelligence agencies. This GitHub is so stuffed with trigger-words of terrorism topics / October 7, 2023...

Isn't that Reddit user account behavior really odd? https://old.reddit.com/user/p_yth every comment gone after getting negative attention on Pluribus posting? And I caught it in first 12 hours...

See the hate dehumanization fandom right here in this message, an organized group, organized hate club.

Everything from “I just watched the show and only I noticed this very-not-subtle detail” or fan theories that read like they were produced by the decaying brain of a media illiterate redditor."

The popular subreddit (of which is outside the context of this posting linking 2 that are *not* the popular one) has a wild "no politics" policy on a TV show that has Air Force One and illegal aliens being handcuffed by Carol after bombing illegal aliens at her house. A show with 3 lesbian women as center character has a *no politics* policy in USA December 2025. Very sus, suspicious as all fuck to have such a policy about a show.

Keep in mind that the show story itself never discusses the Great Seal of the United States of America. The symbols on the Dollar Bill are not discussed in the show. The word "Pluribus" is only shown on Air Force One in Episode Two, not noted by any of the characters. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum

Much of the story is to the audience, the title of the show, the opening graphics of sound waves pulsing through the word "Pluribus" that the characters inside the story have no line to, the context isn't there for them.

Note the age of the account. In a nation where President Donald Trump and White House provide constant stimulation and entertainment every hour of every day in year, the only thing people seem to find non-boring about Pluribus is low-effort mindless commenting on Reddit.

>  this show didn't exactly deliver the punch of BB s1 at all.

That is what L like about the show.

Breaking Bad is extremely light on science fiction. It bends some rules about pure meth being the color blue. Some stuff like that.

Pluribus - the magic ability for human brains to wireless download the best skills without { teaching, education, learning } is far-out science. Even if the world had made high-quality John Cena education videos on how to fly an airplane, the memorization and muscle memory of being able to even do a poor job of the task would take practice time and be dangerous.

I also like that this show is about book tour, book fandom, book authoring, book reading, book comparison. This is one of the largest USA social issues of our time, people abandoning long-form learning and study in favor of TLDR and Apple iPhone screen size content.

2. The child once birthed outside the mothership, is now free floating in space with free will and able to navigate and create new values.

3. It is no subtle coincidence that lesbian women are married and could very well be virgin women who write about *seamen* Pirates.

4. It is no subtle coincidence that the season ending is on December 24, December 25. Again, childbirth kills mothers frequently. 

Rebirth metaphors abound.

A downvoted Reddit comment calling out the constant attacks on serious people on Reddit over this show. People who hang out and instantly reply with mocking "ok, BUDDY, ha ha har ha" [Celebration of Ignorance](../Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md) messages. My reply public electronic message:

> Not funny

the Reddit hive mind really dislikes being told that Vince Gilligan has a message for Reddit hive mind attitudes of mocking and insulting and manipulating people. Elon Musk followers here from StarLink and his other corporations.

there's no simple answer for how *we* might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and [actually listening](https://youtu.be/QkF3oxziUI4?t=427) to each other

They downvoted the user's comment too for providing a link to information. All the comments are tiny-short hyper-banal Reddit. Elon Musk tiny-short Tweet-think patterns to attack serious complex ideas. May 4, 2019 I created this https://old.Reddit.com/r/HyperBanalisation/ Subreddit to document the behavior. And boy, when December 2019 COVID-2019 came to the world stage, did Reddit mock and banalize science on that topic! LOL anti-mask anti-human cheering on Trump leadership as a "LOL cow" to milk for thrills and amusement.

My message to We The People of Reddit hive mind. I just now edited it (this GitHub timestamp of this commit) that won't get picked up, so here is after revision:

> This failure of the biological defense vindicates the "Sensitive" archetype, proving that Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons) is the spiritual successor to Chuck McGill. In Better Call Saul, Chuck claimed to be allergic to electricity and wrapped himself in space blankets, which acted as a primitive Faraday cage to block the incoming Kepler frequency. Bugonia presents the exact same mechanic adapted for a different alien signature. Teddy Gatz is dismissed by society as a conspiracy theorist, yet he correctly identifies Michelle as an alien and discovers that covering her body in antihistamine cream prevents her from sending a "distress signal" to her mothership. Both men were dismissed as mentally ill

* "personal experience of that **deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious** lives, and a myth is the society’s dream. The myth is the **public dream** and the dream is the private myth. If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn’t, you’ve got an **adventure in the Dark Forest** ahead of you." - [year 1988 book, page fourty-eight](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA48&dq=%22If+your+private+myth,+your+dream,+happens+to+coincide+with+that+of+the+society%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

Many short messages on Reddit that don't go outside Reddit for learning. My reply to this short Reddit comment message:

> Radio signals come from radio transmitters. 

Biological building blocks can build radio signals. Even the sun and pulsars create radio signals and they are not the kind of electronics that humans create at the VLA in New Mexico.

My message. Trying to suggest book reading is central to a TV show about { book authors, book tours, book writing, book reading, book fandoms }

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1pzqv5h/just_finished_my_3rd_rewatchi_do_see_the_goat/nws9g96/

My message. Will people connect the song with Mr. White and dancing on his grave with a Mr. Black Parade against Mr. White? The summer being a metaphor for after Mr. White and the white supremacy of Breaking Bad? And how at Minute 22 of Episode One, the two Torches of Freedom of Lady Liberty lesbians are standing at the Public House that is Walter White's grave site? Is Helen watching over Carol, through it all, the Rise and Fall?

PREDICTION_A My personal message with a possible story plot / arc of the story like the Twilight Zone family. Interstellar 2014 ending with frozen eggs. The gumbo of metaphors are there { frozen eggs, world war, atomic bomb employee from family name, escape to a new planet } that Dr. Brand does on her new planet mothering frozen eggs. It's not an outcome of the story I'm married to or anything, but it is in the realm of good listening to Vince Gilligan and cast at the end of Season One.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1pzr55q/third_from_the_sun_twilight_zone_atom_bomb/nwsdr3f/

At least it's a serious reply. Here is my response message: 

> How does she leave earth? We don't have interstellar travel.

We have only gotten 1 out of 4 seasons of story.

There are thousands of paths this show can go, just some simple examples:

1. The hive mind building the radio signal to "pay it forward" the 78-second RNA may develop some **newly developed experimental** technology that Carol can use. In the Twilight Zone episode: "Sturka realizes that there is only one way to escape — steal an **experimental**, top-secret spacecraft" - say in year 2029 timeline of the show.

2. It turns out there are other alien planets sending messages and it isn't only Kepler 22B "pay it forward".  Carol gets technology or personal help from competing aliens. HHGTTG pickup or help.

3. Carol's last name turns out to be she is an alien on earth and her immune system defends against the Kepler 22B RNA 78-second attack. Jupiter Ascending (2015) plot about Carol having special genetics. "she's the genetic reincarnation of an alien queen and the rightful owner of Earth"

I'm talking THOUSANDS of ways this story can go, that's just  a trinity of 3 branches on the tree of what four full seasons and external supporting material could deliver.

Twitter-length replies that **only scratch the surface** of thinking here. People complain the show is slow paced when they aren't absorbing just how huge the technology change of instant skill downloads wireless is for humanity. It leaves the invention of the Gutenberg Printing Press and Internet in the dust! Extreme high speed information networking that uses almost no more energy than a regular human body does. My reply message:

> I don't think the hive has knowledge beyond what humans know.

A waitress can instantly learn to fly perfect an airplane. 

Ravi, the child of  Laxmi in India, can instantly learn and skip all school and education. They can also organize, wait in lines, work way faster than old-school humans.

Riff on Reddit hive mind replies and mindsets, inception of Thunder One, Page 3 of Finengans Wake, Babel Tower Climbing... my reply message:

> Did the hive mind end all cults?

Almost all cults are based on language. L Ron Hubbard writing, Heaven's gate storytelling, Jonestown story telling, Rupert Murdoch Fox News HDTV cult, etc. https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/

All languages are now merged, The Tower of Babel has been climbed now.  The science fiction story of Torah Genesis 11:1 is now cracked for humanity by Kepler 22B message payload. All pass-**words**, all secrets, gone. John 1:1 broken.

Carol being a pirate book author is a key. The entire hive is her fandom now, hanging on her every word. Helen's graduate school book work at Minute 22 of Episode One is key... And Carol has a Pirate Radio / Radio Shack buddy too... so it isn't just Pirate Book publishing, but also Pirate Radio tools. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_radio
