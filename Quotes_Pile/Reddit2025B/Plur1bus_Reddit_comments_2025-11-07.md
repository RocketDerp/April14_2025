I think 2025 society has a very warped sense of defending the status quo. Putin and Trump running circles around USA. Trump not only being POTUS once, but now twice. Putin has had a war going since February 2014. The Middle East Palestine / Israel conflict has people all over the world in tears that humanity hasn't found better solution to terrorism. Trump is threatening to take over Canada, Panama, Greenland, etc. Pultin relases videos of London being drowned with nuclear bomb technology. To declare that humanity has good emotonal regulation... there is a fucking reason Carol has a machine regulating her car driving booze level.

Published August 2000: "Howard Bloom's Global Brain argues that life has evolved as a "worldwide learning machine" or "global brain," with each species playing a role in a massive, interconnected system. This isn't a new phenomenon but an evolutionary process dating back to early bacterial colonies, which continued through social animals like spiny lobsters and bees, and is now manifesting in human society and digital networks. The book proposes that culture and society are not just byproducts of individual evolution but are shaped by a "mass mind" that tests ideas through group selection and competition, with technology like the internet being a recent step in this long history. " - Google A.I. summary. I've been studying this book since year 2015 https://web.stanford.edu/class/symbsys205/global_brain.html
