Imagine commenting on Reddit about superficial and banal behavior, calling a mother "basic" for using meme touch device filters, on a meme mill, Reddit.

The downvote-disagree behavior of Reddit. Which triggers their magic secret spam filtering when you have recent downvotes. Even when Reddit server code was open source years ago, they didn't publish their secret spam filtering logic. They left that closed-source.

Simulacra of resistance. Russian Internet Research Agency since yar 2013 covers every side, not just two sides, both sides, EVERY side. See: August 24, 2018 medical topic devidence, validated: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

Simple think "White People Twittre" Twitter-length tiny-short messages on Reddit commenitng. The IRA since year 2013, the Putin Media Invasin, more than THREE FULLL YEARS before the November 2016 election day. Fiction addiciton has only increased, the abandonment of nonfiction learning about Russian information warfare and media ecology TURN TO WHAT? Turning away from Donald J Trump, one man, does not address the EVERY DAY ALL THE TIME addictions to low-effort Twitter (Musk), Bluesky, Reddit trash learning. This s not new in 2025, this is Trump's SECOND TERM. The brain damage to people caused by Cambridge Analytica doctors is self-harm. Even if a good President (non-fiction leadership), We The People have to face up to the media addiction that is out of control. We The People on the world stage need a massive sober-up reconcitiation. Complete abandonment in out-ggroup hate of Levant religion interpretations. The 1954 Equation.

People can not tell what is real. There has been no effort to work together and get all people on the same page against The Russian "War Against Reality" described September 9, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

NOW? November 2025, like this hasn't been a Russian campaign since year 2013. Denial abounds.

Simulacra of resistance messages. Not trolling, but furthering the fiction addictions into Russian simulations.

Reddit users VOTED for, upvoted, anti-reality. EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY since year 2013. "What they", us vs. them. Abandonment of reality is what people on Reddit voted for November 1, 2025. Reddit vs. Twitter, people just don't GET IT. No rescue of Trump, no rescue of MAGA from Kremlin. Surkov won, Putin won.
