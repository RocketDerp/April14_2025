This s not new in 2025, this is Trump's SECOND TERM. The brain damage to people caused by Cambridge Analytica doctors is self-harm.

Compassionless, anti-forgiveness, punishment giving, mandatory dehumanization of an ex-lover society.

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

BILL MOYERS: One not only biologically but spiritually.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: **Primarily spiritually**. The biological is the distraction which may lead you to the wrong identification.

MOYERS: Then the necessary function of marriage, perpetuating ourselves in children, is not the primary one.

CAMPBELL: No, that’s really just the elementary aspect of marriage. There are two completely different stages of marriage. First is the youthful marriage following the wonderful impulse that nature has given us in the interplay of the sexes biologically in order to produce children. But there comes a time when the child graduates from the family and the couple is left. I’ve been amazed at the number of my friends who in their forties or fifties go apart. They have had a perfectly decent life together with the child, but they interpreted their union in terms of their relationship through the child. They did not interpret it in terms of their **own personal relationship to each other**.

Marriage is a relationship. When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you’re sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship. The Chinese image of the Tao, with the dark and light interacting—that’s the relationship of yang and yin, male and female, which is what a marriage is. And that’s what you have become when you have married. You’re no longer this one alone; your identity is in a relationship. Marriage is not a simple love affair, it’s an ordeal, and the **ordeal is the sacrifice of ego** to a relationship in which two have become one.

MOYERS: So marriage is utterly incompatible with the idea of doing one’s own thing.

CAMPBELL: It’s not simply one’s own thing, you see. It is, in a sense, doing one’s own thing, but the one isn’t just you, it’s the two together as one. And that’s a purely mythological image signifying the sacrifice of the visible entity for a transcendent good. This is something that becomes beautifully realized in the second stage of marriage, what I call the alchemical stage, of the two experiencing that they are one. If they are still living as they were in the primary stage of marriage, they will go apart when their children leave. Daddy will fall in love with some little nubile girl and run off, and Mother will be left with an empty house and heart, and will have to work it out on her own, in her own way.
MOYERS: That’s because we don’t understand the two levels of marriage.

CAMPBELL: You don’t make a commitment.

MOYERS: We presume to—we make a commitment for better or for worse.

CAMPBELL: That’s the remnant of a ritual.

MOYERS: And the ritual has lost its force. The ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form. And that’s true in the rituals of society and in the **personal rituals** of marriage and religion.

CAMPBELL: How many people before marriage receive spiritual instruction as to what the marriage means? You can stand up in front of a judge and in ten minutes get married. The marriage ceremony in India lasts three days. That couple is glued.

MOYERS: You’re saying that marriage is not just a social arrangement, it’s a spiritual exercise.

CAMPBELL: It’s primarily a spiritual exercise, and the society is supposed to help us have the realization. Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of man. When man is in the service of society, **you have a monster state, and that’s what is threatening the world at this minute** (year 1986).

MOYERS: What happens when a society no longer embraces a powerful mythology?

CAMPBELL: What we’ve got on our hands. If you want to find out what it means to have a society without any rituals, read the New York Times. (ROUNDSPARROW: This interview was in year 1986, update to November 2025 - the front page of Reddit and Bluesky)

MOYERS: And you’d find?

CAMPBELL: The news of the day, including destructive and violent acts by young people who don’t know how to behave in a civilized society.

MOYERS: Society has provided them no rituals by which they become members of the tribe, of the community. All children need to be twice born, to learn to function rationally in the present world, leaving childhood behind. I think of that passage in the [first book of Corinthians](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm): “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”

CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it.

“Naturally, bureaucrats can be expected to embrace a technology that helps to create the illusion that decisions are not under their control. Because of its seeming intelligence and impartiality, a computer has an almost magical tendency to direct attention away from the people in charge of bureaucratic functions and toward itself, as if the computer were the true source of authority. A bureaucrat armed with a computer is the unacknowledged legislator of our age, and a terrible burden to bear.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, year 1992

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.

Instead of organizing and ralleying around the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights and outher serious topics - it's endless meme-washing and rage-junkies flocking to Trumpism and MAGA for entertainment. Just like Epsten List entertainment / QAnon "Q Drops" Pizzagate crap. It isn't about giving women voices by supporting Malala on social media by asserting her name and her possie ("Malala Fund's Young Women Advisory Council"), it's constantly ragecow LOLcow milking of men like Epstein, men like Musk, men like Trump, as media role models. Just like few people don't promote Pussy Riot against Putin, it's instead just meme mills insulting Trump and Putin constantly in the face of the Kremlin information war since year 2013. No concern to give voice to women / girls in the donmination by Taliban elders, Putin elders, Rupert Murdoch elders, Trump elders.

Manipulation of minds on a scale by a military firm, Cambridge Analytica. Reddit society has minds blown into total denial of nonfiction learning on the subject. “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019**

This is reproducable science, the same genetics can run in a family. Compassion and love are super-rational, above rationanl. The crisis is that hate and dehumanization are sub-rational, below rational. Goodness has to be prized. We are not facing up tht people consider building implosions, fireworks, bombs to be thrilling entertainment in filsm and in person. There is a measureable attraction to wrecking the Earth with sports and machines. Pollution caused by motorsports (gasoline boats, car races, etc). For me, the Tower of Babel and avoicance of Wiki style global sharing of factual / truthful / honest information is one of our biggest crisis. There is so much advertising / marketing that uses emotional manpualtion and menntal exploitation / brain exploits - that people are not even aware of the problems we are causing. For example, if it turns out that plastic plateware / food / food utensels (widespread usage for the past 70 years in USA) cause long-term health problems for humnity... we may be in serious trouble. And by not organiing factual information and sharing on Wiki style systems, people were kept out of even stuying or thinking about these concerns. Of course, I tend to balance such concerns that humanity has known for hundreds (if not thousands) of years that alcohol is toxic and kills life (one can easily experiment this with alcohol killing insects that water would not kill). And we consume it for recreation and promote it / manipulate others with marketing and adverising. And the societies that ban it (includiong USA Prohibition). So the case can be made that humanity prizes self-harm and even celebrates it. People seem to prize loud automobiles and motorbikes. https://www.silive.com/opinion/2023/03/quiet-those-cars-and-motorcycles-our-opinion.html

That's a core self-awareness of Finnegans Wake (year 1924 onward) is that language "laws" of John 1:1 are not to be dictated by *language clergy*, authority of The Church. That Romans 11:32 Bible verse is we are *forced* to create our own Tower of Babel by the very mechanism of sharing The Bible / Torah (and later Quran, Book of Mormon, all MonoMyth (Joyce, not Campbell) patterns of Hollywood, books, etc). OPERA_A https://youtu.be/TV3vT5nW_I4?t=149
Adam Harvey (JoyceGeek), "and exigeats (spelling? exigeants? in JoyceGeek's context meaning is "enthusiasts") to be a reference to the
Tower of Babel from The Book of Genesis
11: 1-9 in which God punishes Mankind's
tower building hubris by forcing everyone
to speak in different languages and not
understand each other. Now, actually the
Bible doesn't use the word "punish" and I
think Joyce may have taken note of this.
Because, if anything, Finnegans Wake is a
a celebration of the confounding of
tongues described in the Bible. And
really think about it: **why shouldn't we
celebrate** the fact that each of us can
express ourselves and **formulate our own
ideas** and **our own individual and
idiosyncratic idioms** well take. For
example the word Thunder um now we all
know what the phenomenon that word
describes is but isn't it amazing how
many different ways we humans have of
giving that concept expression."

“We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.

But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985

"All that has happened is that the public has **adjusted to incoherence** and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the **Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion** than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**

BBC, Adam Curtis](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html).

These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

“The medium does things to people. And they’re always completely unaware of this. They don’t really notice the new medium that is roughing them up. They think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium. As movies are tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content—novels used to be the content—of movies.” — Marshall McLuhan. “This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage”, an experimental documentary produced by Ernest Pintoff and Guy Fraumeni, narrated by actor Edward Binnes and broadcasted on NBC TV (19 March 1967). https://youtu.be/cFwVCHkL-JU?t=195

In Joseph Campbell's view, evil is part of life and accept and celebrate life the way it is.

The "free" busses are paid for by taxes, they aren't being paid for by the mayor. The whole idea is ignroance being celebrated by Reddit. Carl Sagan was a New York boy. ... ... ...      
"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Cult. No quotes, no book author names, no book titles, no links. The "cult" is to fiction storytelling, and in fiction addiction (Bible science fiction for example, L Ron Hubbard science fiction as another example) reality doesn't have to follow rules.

Don't love stupid people. We are investing in technology to make ourselves dumber as Carl Sagan said in 1995. Personally I do not enjoy where everything is a sneak attackand trick and Donald Trump is what parents since June 2015 is a role model. And sport stars and all the media labor that goes into stardom icons.

"This isn't news", "We all know". In the addiction to fiction, goodness doesn't matter. Ivanka wouldn't speak up. And it isn't about wealth. Rock stars and film stars and TV stars and sports stars - I had a large school class in Fort Wayne, Indiana - and you could hear girls in class bragging about sports stars men taking their virginity. Bragging about older men. You could ask the girls and they would talk to you about it. Most boys just didn't talk to girls / women and sure as hell didn't listen to women. People are attracted to popularity. Popularity is business, an industry. There are promoters, public relations, Edward Bernays students. Boys are attracted to sports in my 1985 first year in high school because it draws the girls in Indiana. NFL football / NBA basketball stardom was a path many children were fed, into the supply chain. Trump isn't wrong about being a star / icon.

Study the Middle East. Faith in hate, out-group hate patterns. The Founding Fathers did not recommend bi-polar logic.  People do not take nonfiction study of media ecology seriously. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      
BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about.

Reddit audiences adore the Surkov student methods. Constant entertainment and amusement at calling the government dumb / stupid / moron / idiot. Surkov realized that people prize insulting above all else. That people will die for metaphors / die for mythology content. People could be posting the Wikipedia link to the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944 and say: the prediction made in 1944 was correct! Instead, people worship Lugi for sneak attack manipulative gun murders in December 2024. Gun worship is so much more entrtaining to media addicted society.
