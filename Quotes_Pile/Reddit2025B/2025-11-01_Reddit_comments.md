The IRA since year 2013, the Putin Media Invasin, more than THREE FULLL YEARS before the November 2016 election day. Fiction addiciton has only increased, the abandonment of nonfiction learning about Russian information warfare and media ecology TURN TO WHAT? Turning away from Donald J Trump, one man, does not address the EVERY DAY ALL THE TIME addictions to low-effort Twitter (Musk), Bluesky, Reddit trash learning. This s not new in 2025, this is Trump's SECOND TERM. The brain damage to people caused by Cambridge Analytica doctors is self-harm. Even if a good President (non-fiction leadership), We The People have to face up to the media addiction that is out of control. We The People on the world stage need a massive sober-up reconcitiation. Complete abandonment in out-ggroup hate of Levant religion interpretations. The 1954 Equation.

Compassionless, anti-forgiveness, punishment giving, mandatory dehumanization of an ex-lover society. Machine lover society with constant new software technology and hardware technology - but mandatory anti-love rulesets in people's minds: "DO NOT ENGAGE WITH ANYONE". George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

BILL MOYERS: One not only biologically but spiritually.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: **Primarily spiritually**. The biological is the distraction which may lead you to the wrong identification.

MOYERS: Then the necessary function of marriage, perpetuating ourselves in children, is not the primary one.

CAMPBELL: No, that’s really just the elementary aspect of marriage. There are two completely different stages of marriage. First is the youthful marriage following the wonderful impulse that nature has given us in the interplay of the sexes biologically in order to produce children. But there comes a time when the child graduates from the family and the couple is left. I’ve been amazed at the number of my friends who in their forties or fifties go apart. They have had a perfectly decent life together with the child, but they interpreted their union in terms of their relationship through the child. They did not interpret it in terms of their **own personal relationship to each other**.

Marriage is a relationship. When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you’re sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship. The Chinese image of the Tao, with the dark and light interacting—that’s the relationship of yang and yin, male and female, which is what a marriage is. And that’s what you have become when you have married. You’re no longer this one alone; your identity is in a relationship. Marriage is not a simple love affair, it’s an ordeal, and the **ordeal is the sacrifice of ego** to a relationship in which two have become one.

MOYERS: So marriage is utterly incompatible with the idea of doing one’s own thing.

CAMPBELL: It’s not simply one’s own thing, you see. It is, in a sense, doing one’s own thing, but the one isn’t just you, it’s the two together as one. And that’s a purely mythological image signifying the sacrifice of the visible entity for a transcendent good. This is something that becomes beautifully realized in the second stage of marriage, what I call the alchemical stage, of the two experiencing that they are one. If they are still living as they were in the primary stage of marriage, they will go apart when their children leave. Daddy will fall in love with some little nubile girl and run off, and Mother will be left with an empty house and heart, and will have to work it out on her own, in her own way.
MOYERS: That’s because we don’t understand the two levels of marriage.

CAMPBELL: You don’t make a commitment.

MOYERS: We presume to—we make a commitment for better or for worse.

CAMPBELL: That’s the remnant of a ritual.

MOYERS: And the ritual has lost its force. The ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form. And that’s true in the rituals of society and in the **personal rituals** of marriage and religion.

CAMPBELL: How many people before marriage receive spiritual instruction as to what the marriage means? You can stand up in front of a judge and in ten minutes get married. The marriage ceremony in India lasts three days. That couple is glued.

MOYERS: You’re saying that marriage is not just a social arrangement, it’s a spiritual exercise.

CAMPBELL: It’s primarily a spiritual exercise, and the society is supposed to help us have the realization. Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of man. When man is in the service of society, **you have a monster state, and that’s what is threatening the world at this minute** (year 1986).

MOYERS: What happens when a society no longer embraces a powerful mythology?

CAMPBELL: What we’ve got on our hands. If you want to find out what it means to have a society without any rituals, read the New York Times. (ROUNDSPARROW: This interview was in year 1986, update to November 2025 - the front page of Reddit and Bluesky)

MOYERS: And you’d find?

CAMPBELL: The news of the day, including destructive and violent acts by young people who don’t know how to behave in a civilized society.

MOYERS: Society has provided them no rituals by which they become members of the tribe, of the community. All children need to be twice born, to learn to function rationally in the present world, leaving childhood behind. I think of that passage in the [first book of Corinthians](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm): “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”

CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it.

“Naturally, bureaucrats can be expected to embrace a technology that helps to create the illusion that decisions are not under their control. Because of its seeming intelligence and impartiality, a computer has an almost magical tendency to direct attention away from the people in charge of bureaucratic functions and toward itself, as if the computer were the true source of authority. A bureaucrat armed with a computer is the unacknowledged legislator of our age, and a terrible burden to bear.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, year 1992

It isn't forgiveness, it's outright addiction to Trump as a "LOL cow to milk" for Reddit hate and insulting platform. ... ... ...      
"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Trump is the role model for age 34 content creators and Reddit audiences via Truth Social and White House media empire example. A New York City Andy Kaufman media star, Donald Trump ragecow. Since June 16, 2015 - people milk Trump for rage, milk Trump for poop diaper content, milk Trump for golf course outing jokes. Instead of organizing and ralleying around the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights and outher serious topics - it's endless meme-washing and rage-junkies flocking to Trumpism and MAGA for entertainment. Just like Epsten List entertainment / QAnon "Q Drops" Pizzagate crap. It isn't about giving women voices by supporting Malala on social media by asserting her name and her possie ("Malala Fund's Young Women Advisory Council"), it's constantly ragecow LOLcow milking of men like Epstein, men like Musk, men like Trump, as media role models. Just like few people don't promote Pussy Riot against Putin, it's instead just meme mills insulting Trump and Putin constantly in the face of the Kremlin information war since year 2013. No concern to give voice to women / girls in the donmination by Taliban elders, Putin elders, Rupert Murdoch elders, Trump elders.

That is NOT THE FIRST STEP. Loyalty to Truth Social and Fox News bullshit and Reddit IRA messages is the BIG FIRST STEP. Doctors, pyscological doctors, planned this! Manipulation of minds on a scale by a military firm, Cambridge Analytica. Reddit society has minds blown into total denial of nonfiction learning on the subject. “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019**
