# Simulacra of Resistance: Reddit


Front-page Monday October 13, 2025

No dates on these images, they are now stripped away, which was not normal on Reddit 2 years ago. Extremely low-effort simualcra of a video game with very poor writing. Conditioning the Reddit audience to be thrilled with the most simple ideas and message patterns.

WORSE: this is mind-fuck. The Internet Research Agency on Twitter IS COMING for Kevin Sorbo, using Cambridge Anlytica payloads since year 2013. Billionare owner Elon Musk and others are predoatry exploing what Putin's messaging army has conditioned into extreme extreme extreme low-effort out-group messages. Messages to hate upon fellow Americans, and to be addicted to fiction content and extreme extreme extreme low-effort inforamtion patterns. To cram all issues into mindsets of left vs. right, etc. PEOPLE ARE OUT to wreck the USA, billionares and media predators, and the "Murder By Words" reply is manipulating the mindsets of the audience to trivalize and banalize the problem int tiny-short Twitter-think patterns.

Yes, the stripped date, this is a rerun programmind the Reddit audience message. The origianl Twitter messages are dated March 31, 2023 - that is 2.5 years ago. This removal of dates on Reddit "screen captures" and images is a very serious media ecology problem. Normalizing trash situational awareness. Original: https://x.com/ksorbs/status/1641812758764175360 - the context bewilderment of this message being in March 2023 when Donald Trump was not even President, Joe Biden was all year 2023, so how magically is Trump standing in the way of the magical "Left" coming for "us" (whoever us) is. The Russians have been coming for 100% of the poplulation to condition 5,000 patterns of addiction to fiction and hate of American people via memes and messages on Twitter and other media sytems. Is Russia and Putin "The Left" cming for the U.S.A.? Is that the subconsious metal pattern being exploited?

Again, dates are removed from posting. It is a "meme rerun" from July 8, 2022 https://x.com/realJennaEllis/status/1545215153716613120 - extremely low-effort comment to mock and insult, and people on Reddit audience are given mindset training / reinforement training to mock back "idiot!" in the Reddit Title. Simulacra of resistance, that his is "clever comebacks". Eats right out of the hands of Surkovian information warfare patterns. Constantly tiny-short reactions, high-speed thinking, amusement and entertainment as mocking Americans and not confronting the Russian mind-fucking problem of cults of anti-reality anti-goodness.

Reddit tiny-message afficnados live in a anti-reality world where they behave as if all over the world police treat home like a santuary. Like you can't be evicted from a home. "During the United States of America Great Depression, home evictions were widespread due to mass unemployment and falling incomes, with over 273,000 families evicted in year 1932 alone." As if there isn't films and TV shows and news reports depicting police going into a house or onto property of a house. This is a highly upvoted popular comment. It is denial of reality. People VOTE for this hyper reality, the drama of the arrest is to get coverage. This is all Putin / Kremlin techniques. People can not connect this with the Alaska meeting of Putin and Trump this year. Trump and White House need to be RESCUED from Putin mental manipulation. People are compusively following media patterns without any self-awareness at the media ecology level. Even Trump doesn't realize the self-harm he is doing with Tony Clifton performances, Trump just knows *it works*, and that's the compulisve drive is the feedback loops with the audience. We are, as a nation, leeting media addiciton drive us into patterns in our brain that are self-harm. Even Cambridge Analyutica doctors are not self-aware of the monomyth patterns they deployed and thier long-term impact. When CA did what they did in year 2013 with the IRA, there was no ChatGPT to train on that until year 2022. We are in a feedback of chasing our own tail, our own mental defects, of out-group hate patterns! This is runaway monomyth mind-fuck! The WHOLE THIS of society! People craving self-harm high-speed video and messaging.  ... ... ...

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Which is why you stand up for peace and goodness for their own sake. Send your message to the entire planet of over 8 billion people that peace and goodness is more important to your life than high-speed disposable commenting messages on meme mills.

Reddit community has a choice, Reddit people using free time and spare time to comment and upvote and downvote. To get on the same page of goodness and halt all entertainment and mocking and be serious. If you are going to die, leave a message for the rest of the world of what you stand up for besides mocking and insulting like Truth Social and Reddit and Bluesky does.

EVERY SINGLE MEDIA USER, REDDIT COMMUNITY INCLUSIVE, should be HALTING ALL ENTERTAINMENT and using all avaialble free time and spare time EVERY DAY, not just October 18, 2025. This has been ONGOING FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS. The media addictions have run the USA right into Russia's Internet Research Agency since and Cambridge Anlytica self-harm feedback loops and mental programming.

Where are all the MEDIA USERS on touch devices who are using free time and spare time for far less important matters, and not asking a world of over 8 billion people to all stand up with cult deprogramming and confronting Fox News by promoting 2015 film by Jen Senko and other SUSTIANED EVERY DAY, EVERY 6 HOURS, serious matters. And stop moking around, mocking, insulting, downplaying, satire-washing, amusement-washing what is going on. Read the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights and SEE what was predicted and PONDER why nobody can even cite the Second Bill of Rights when it is a single Wikipedia click away. How AVOIDANT people are of goodness and calls for more goodness, and preaching of goodness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights

People didn't take the pandemic serious, they did not take Bill Gates in April 2015 seriously - and can't even say "Bill Gates was correct in his April 2015 Ted Talk". https://old.reddit.com/r/goodnews/comments/1o5m61i/robert_de_niro_weve_had_2_and_a_half_centuries_of/nja9ijf/ And we are NOT PREPARED for the NEXT disease outbreak! We are more hate-filled than before COVID-19! People are not TAKING GOODNESS AND NONFICTION LEARNING SERIOUSLY! People are flocking to the fiction storytelling of Fox News HDTV fiction, Reddit commenting fiction, bullshit fiction on Bluesky, Truth Social fiction. Fiction leadership has consumed the nation. Addiction to sports mentality, simple-think, and avoidance of Wikipedia / Wiki style "on the same page, refined knowledge*.
