# Simulacra of Resistance: Reddit


Front-page Monday October 13, 2025

No dates on these images, they are now stripped away, which was not normal on Reddit 2 years ago. Extremely low-effort simualcra of a video game with very poor writing. Conditioning the Reddit audience to be thrilled with the most simple ideas and message patterns.

WORSE: this is mind-fuck. The Internet Research Agency on Twitter IS COMING for Kevin Sorbo, using Cambridge Anlytica payloads since year 2013. Billionare owner Elon Musk and others are predoatry exploing what Putin's messaging army has conditioned into extreme extreme extreme low-effort out-group messages. Messages to hate upon fellow Americans, and to be addicted to fiction content and extreme extreme extreme low-effort inforamtion patterns. To cram all issues into mindsets of left vs. right, etc. PEOPLE ARE OUT to wreck the USA, billionares and media predators, and the "Murder By Words" reply is manipulating the mindsets of the audience to trivalize and banalize the problem int tiny-short Twitter-think patterns.

Yes, the stripped date, this is a rerun programmind the Reddit audience message. The origianl Twitter messages are dated March 31, 2023 - that is 2.5 years ago. This removal of dates on Reddit "screen captures" and images is a very serious media ecology problem. Normalizing trash situational awareness. Original: https://x.com/ksorbs/status/1641812758764175360 - the context bewilderment of this message being in March 2023 when Donald Trump was not even President, Joe Biden was all year 2023, so how magically is Trump standing in the way of the magical "Left" coming for "us" (whoever us) is. The Russians have been coming for 100% of the poplulation to condition 5,000 patterns of addiction to fiction and hate of American people via memes and messages on Twitter and other media sytems. Is Russia and Putin "The Left" cming for the U.S.A.? Is that the subconsious metal pattern being exploited?

Again, dates are removed from posting. It is a "meme rerun" from July 8, 2022 https://x.com/realJennaEllis/status/1545215153716613120 - extremely low-effort comment to mock and insult, and people on Reddit audience are given mindset training / reinforement training to mock back "idiot!" in the Reddit Title. Simulacra of resistance, that his is "clever comebacks". Eats right out of the hands of Surkovian information warfare patterns. Constantly tiny-short reactions, high-speed thinking, amusement and entertainment as mocking Americans and not confronting the Russian mind-fucking problem of cults of anti-reality anti-goodness.

Still Monday. Front page.

Trump throws out a symbolic gumbo of mind-fuck, and the audience flocks chasing it like a dog chasing a ball thrown by the owner. Trump is reprogramming minds in Vlad Surkov student techniques, Tony Clifton declaring the absurd and surreal, except nobody on Reddit can name Surkovian methods or Peter P's books and Cambridge Analytica mind patterns. How to blow audience minds: It's a halmark of Tony Clifton performances. For example, a 2000 retrospective in The Guardian describes an announcer introducing Clifton as "a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined". https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/25/comment

"they" write shallow non-menaingful Titles for posting. They prize low-effort disposable commenting. The dates of this screen shot have again been removed. It looks like a mockup, and not an actual screenshot, more simulacra. The blue checkarms next to both account names are to imply Twitter / X media platform? 

It is simplistic, out-group programming, it is a simualcra of ressiting. It does not take sriously the media ecology crisis. It intends the audience to be banal and shallow and superficial on these topics and not face up to the world history of media ecology / Televison shows being covered on "the new media" of Twitter / Reddit / latest iPhone and Android app updates this month. ... ... ...      
“The medium does things to people. And they’re always completely unaware of this. They don’t really notice the new medium that is roughing them up. They think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium. As movies are tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content—novels used to be the content—of movies.” — Marshall McLuhan [Quotes from the film “This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage”, an experimental documentary produced by Ernest Pintoff and Guy Fraumeni, narrated by actor Edward Binnes and broadcasted on NBC TV (19 March 1967)](https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-film/)

Joking, laughing, humor-washing, mockery-washing. Anything to avoid nonficiton learning. Just like Reddit, but this is a leak from Telegram. Where humor and jokes are the religion above all other religions. The God of self-exploiting the brain, bashing your brin into a LOL amusement stupor. Neil Postamns 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" described today October 14, 2025 on Reddit.

Simualcra of resistance. Trump creates a Total Mockery with his Tony Clifton antics politcs methods of acting for over TEN YARS AND THREE MONTHS. Then mocking back. It's entertaining to pople for TEN YEARS, but it does not remove. Surkovian governing is not removed by mocking, nor are Tony Clifton acts.

Saturday No Kings Day October 18, 2025 - front page of Reddit     

There is no sustained depth. People could be repeating "1 John 3:17" Bible verse, name dropping that verse, and go after the Christian values of Musk and Trump audiences... (Musk claims to be pro-Christian). Dates removed from the images. Low-effort tiny-length title. Worse, it is "Eating the Onion" that musk only ACCIDENTLY is manipulating what he calls "Woke Mind Virus" of these films. Reddit society is eating this manipulation up. No comprehension of Surkovian information warfare.

Luigi "owned" Reddit with his Reddit account, no he didn't. Lugi couldn't get his Reddit account to get a book from a professor to the front page. He carved the title of the book into gun bullets, and that is what gets to the Reddit front page. Nonfiction book "got owned". Reddit and Bluesky *own the liberals" in simulara of image-based resitance, meme resistance, Fox News and Newsmax and Elon Musk Twitter "ownt he conservatives". Everything is simulacra. People can nto see the forest for the trees that A mocking B, a "owning" B, and B mocking A is the very mental programming that Cambridge Anlaytica and the IRA induced since year 2013. A Race to the bottom of who can mock harder, hate harder, Americans hate Americans while Putin runs circles around USA with meme warfare deployed by the IRA since year 2013.

Low-effort trivail interactio simulation. Dates stripped from the simulated? screen shots. This isn't even clever. The bar of tiny-short message and content is slow low, this is active measures to avoid the problems.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1ocmkx9/i_love_this_clever_question/

Anti-realty simulacra. Front page of Reddit. $200 payment for 4 or 5 hours. Magical rich anti-billionaire paying against Trump and Musk. Left vs. right brainrot, one-bit logic. Are people who dislike Trump in other nations getting paid to dislike Trump? Are people getting paid to love the humans in Ukraine and dislike Putin? Forgetting the Putin and Trump meeting in Alaska between the two No Kings days... the ongoing buddy friendship of Trump and Putin? I think Trump has been manipulated, tricked, bamboozled by Putin. I think war against reality... fantasy fiction that drives people's mindsets into into unreality $200 payments to EVERY PERSON who went is that war against reality. I think there is a feedback loop of Reddit society / community who is chasing the unreality. As "winning", without citing Surkov and other nonfiction facts. The prizing of no-identitty messages and easily created fake accounts on Reddit ispart of that simulacra of a resistance to Trump.       

The Reddit headline says people love this quesiton, love the bullshit eating of bullshit questions and simulacra. Love video games / simulations. Love fiction over nonfiction.

It is not a clever question at all. The entire question is built on an assumption that isn't being recognized: that 100 percent of people support Donald Trump. And that the ONLY incentive people would have to protest Trump on October 18, 2025 is being paid. That it was Trump supporters who sold-out against Trump for $200. That there is nobody who not a natural anti-Trump person. Can you name ANY leader in any nation that doesn't have people motivated by dislike? I mean health care has been thratened by Trump, so people don't need to be paid money to be against Trump.

I thhink the greater problem is people like bullshit news, fiction addiction, bullshit seeking - over nonfiction and sincere honest sources. This is not a MAGA only problem. The very posting on Reddit is evidence of people flocking to shit / bullshit. That's how Fox News has thrived since year 1996. That's how Trump and Putin operate. Exploiting audience attraction to badness, shit, decepiton as some kind of "gotcha", the whole nation is sinking chasing fiction and anti-goodness. "The Media" isn't theproblem, the audience is the problem. The meme decoration of the image on Reddit is the problem. The eogism of self-centered tribal behavior of a "team sport" of a video screen game vs. another video screen game is the problem!
