# Simulacra of Resistance: Reddit


Front-page Monday October 13, 2025

No dates on these images, they are now stripped away, which was not normal on Reddit 2 years ago. Extremely low-effort simualcra of a video game with very poor writing. Conditioning the Reddit audience to be thrilled with the most simple ideas and message patterns.

WORSE: this is mind-fuck. The Internet Research Agency on Twitter IS COMING for Kevin Sorbo, using Cambridge Anlytica payloads since year 2013. Billionare owner Elon Musk and others are predoatry exploing what Putin's messaging army has conditioned into extreme extreme extreme low-effort out-group messages. Messages to hate upon fellow Americans, and to be addicted to fiction content and extreme extreme extreme low-effort inforamtion patterns. To cram all issues into mindsets of left vs. right, etc. PEOPLE ARE OUT to wreck the USA, billionares and media predators, and the "Murder By Words" reply is manipulating the mindsets of the audience to trivalize and banalize the problem int tiny-short Twitter-think patterns.

Yes, the stripped date, this is a rerun programmind the Reddit audience message. The origianl Twitter messages are dated March 31, 2023 - that is 2.5 years ago. This removal of dates on Reddit "screen captures" and images is a very serious media ecology problem. Normalizing trash situational awareness. Original: https://x.com/ksorbs/status/1641812758764175360 - the context bewilderment of this message being in March 2023 when Donald Trump was not even President, Joe Biden was all year 2023, so how magically is Trump standing in the way of the magical "Left" coming for "us" (whoever us) is. The Russians have been coming for 100% of the poplulation to condition 5,000 patterns of addiction to fiction and hate of American people via memes and messages on Twitter and other media sytems. Is Russia and Putin "The Left" cming for the U.S.A.? Is that the subconsious metal pattern being exploited?
