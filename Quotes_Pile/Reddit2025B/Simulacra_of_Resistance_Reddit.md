# Simulacra of Resistance: Reddit


Front-page Monday October 13, 2025

No dates on these images, they are now stripped away, which was not normal on Reddit 2 years ago. Extremely low-effort simulacra of a video game with very poor writing. Conditioning the Reddit audience to be thrilled with the most simple ideas and message patterns.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1o5jcm7/draxd_em_sklounced_shredded_to_bits/

WORSE: this is mind-fuck. The Internet Research Agency on Twitter IS COMING for Kevin Sorbo, using Cambridge Analytica payloads since year 2013. Billionaire owner Elon Musk and others are predatory exploiting what Putin's messaging army has conditioned into extreme extreme extreme low-effort out-group messages. Messages to hate upon fellow Americans, and to be addicted to fiction content and extreme extreme extreme low-effort information patterns. To cram all issues into mindsets of left vs. right, etc. PEOPLE ARE OUT to wreck the USA, billionaires and media predators, and the "Murder By Words" reply is manipulating the mindsets of the audience to trivialize and banalize the problem int tiny-short Twitter-think patterns.

Yes, the stripped date, this is a rerun programming the Reddit audience message. The original Twitter messages are dated March 31, 2023 - that is 2.5 years ago. This removal of dates on Reddit "screen captures" and images is a very serious media ecology problem. Normalizing trash situational awareness. Original: https://x.com/ksorbs/status/1641812758764175360 - the context bewilderment of this message being in March 2023 when Donald Trump was not even President, Joe Biden was all year 2023, so how magically is Trump standing in the way of the magical "Left" coming for "us" (whoever us) is. The Russians have been coming for 100% of the population to condition 5,000 patterns of addiction to fiction and hate of American people via memes and messages on Twitter and other media systems. Is Russia and Putin "The Left" coming for the U.S.A.? Is that the subconscious metal pattern being exploited?

Again, dates are removed from posting. It is a "meme rerun" from July 8, 2022 https://x.com/realJennaEllis/status/1545215153716613120 - extremely low-effort comment to mock and insult, and people on Reddit audience are given mindset training / reinforcement training to mock back "idiot!" in the Reddit Title. Simulacra of resistance, that his is "clever comebacks". Eats right out of the hands of Surkovian information warfare patterns. Constantly tiny-short reactions, high-speed thinking, amusement and entertainment as mocking Americans and not confronting the Russian mind-fucking problem of cults of anti-reality anti-goodness.

&nbsp;

Still Monday. Front page.

Trump throws out a symbolic gumbo of mind-fuck, and the audience flocks chasing it like a dog chasing a ball thrown by the owner. Trump is reprogramming minds in Vlad Surkov student techniques, Tony Clifton declaring the absurd and surreal, except nobody on Reddit can name Surkovian methods or Peter P's books and Cambridge Analytica mind patterns. How to blow audience minds: It's a hallmark of Tony Clifton performances. For example, a 2000 retrospective in The Guardian describes an announcer introducing Clifton as "a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined". https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/25/comment

"they" write shallow non-meaningful Titles for posting. They prize low-effort disposable commenting. The dates of this screen shot have again been removed. It looks like a mockup, and not an actual screenshot, more simulacra. The blue check-marks next to both account names are to imply Twitter / X media platform? 

It is simplistic, out-group programming, it is a simulacra of resisting. It does not take seriously the media ecology crisis. It intends the audience to be banal and shallow and superficial on these topics and not face up to the world history of media ecology / Television shows being covered on "the new media" of Twitter / Reddit / latest iPhone and Android app updates this month. ... ... ...       
“The medium does things to people. And they’re always completely unaware of this. They don’t really notice the new medium that is roughing them up. They think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium. As movies are tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content—novels used to be the content—of movies.” — Marshall McLuhan [Quotes from the film “This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage”, an experimental documentary produced by Ernest Pintoff and Guy Fraumeni, narrated by actor Edward Binnes and broadcasted on NBC TV (19 March 1967)](https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-film/)

Joking, laughing, humor-washing, mockery-washing. Anything to avoid nonficiton learning. Just like Reddit, but this is a leak from Telegram. Where humor and jokes are the religion above all other religions. The God of self-exploiting the brain, bashing your brin into a LOL amusement stupor.

Simulacra of resistance. Trump creates a Total Mockery with his Tony Clifton antics politics methods of acting for over TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS. Then mocking back. It's entertaining to people for TEN YEARS, but it does not remove. Surkovian governing is not removed by mocking, nor are Tony Clifton acts.

Saturday No Kings Day October 18, 2025 - front page of Reddit     

There is no sustained depth. People could be repeating "1 John 3:17" Bible verse, name dropping that verse, and go after the Christian values of Musk and Trump audiences... (Musk claims to be pro-Christian). Dates removed from the images. Low-effort tiny-length title. Worse, it is "Eating the Onion" that musk only ACCIDENTALLY is manipulating what he calls "Woke Mind Virus" of these films. Reddit society is eating this manipulation up. No comprehension of Surkovian information warfare.

Luigi "owned" Reddit with his Reddit account, no he didn't. Lugi couldn't get his Reddit account to get a book from a professor to the front page. He carved the title of the book into gun bullets, and that is what gets to the Reddit front page. Nonfiction book "got owned". Reddit and Bluesky *own the liberals" in simulacra of image-based resistance, meme resistance, Fox News and Newsmax and Elon Musk Twitter "own the conservatives". Everything is simulacra. People (We The People USA and NATO) can not see the forest for the trees that A mocking B, a "owning" B, and B mocking A is the very mental programming that Cambridge Anlaytica and the IRA induced since year 2013. A Race to the bottom of who can mock harder, hate harder, Americans hate Americans while Putin runs circles around USA with meme warfare deployed by the IRA since year 2013.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1ocmkx9/i_love_this_clever_question/

Anti-reality simulacra. Front page of Reddit. $200 payment for 4 or 5 hours. Magical rich anti-billionaire paying against Trump and Musk. Left vs. right brainrot, one-bit logic. Are people who dislike Trump in other nations getting paid to dislike Trump? Are people getting paid to love the humans in Ukraine and dislike Putin? Forgetting the Putin and Trump meeting in Alaska between the two No Kings days... the ongoing buddy friendship of Trump and Putin? [I think Trump has been manipulated, tricked, bamboozled by Putin. I think war against reality (described September 9, 2014)](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)... fantasy fiction that drives people's mindsets into unreality $200 payments to EVERY PERSON who went is that war against reality. I think there is a *feedback loop* of Reddit society / community who is chasing the unreality. As "winning", without citing Surkov and other nonfiction facts. The prizing of no-identity messages and easily created fake accounts on Reddit is part of that simulacra of a resistance to Trump.       

The Reddit headline says people love this question, love the bullshit eating of bullshit questions and simulacra. Love video games / simulations. Love fiction over nonfiction.

It is not a clever question at all. The entire question is built on an assumption that isn't being recognized: that 100 percent of people support Donald Trump. And that the ONLY incentive people would have to protest Trump on October 18, 2025 is being paid. That it was Trump supporters who sold-out against Trump for $200. That there is nobody who not a natural anti-Trump person. Can you name ANY leader in any nation that doesn't have people motivated by dislike? I mean health care has been threatened by Trump, so people don't need to be paid money to be against Trump.

I think the greater problem is people like bullshit news, fiction addiction, bullshit seeking - over nonfiction and sincere honest sources. This is not a MAGA only problem. The very posting on Reddit is evidence of people flocking to shit / bullshit. That's how Fox News has thrived since year 1996. That's how Trump and Putin operate. Exploiting audience attraction to badness, shit, deception as some kind of "gotcha", the whole nation is sinking chasing fiction and anti-goodness. "The Media" isn't the problem, the audience is the problem. The meme decoration of the image on Reddit is the problem. The egoism of self-centered tribal behavior of a "team sport" of a video screen game vs. another video screen game is the problem!

"SMH, Shaking My Head". Entertained at the bad season of memes and entertainment. Shirt little quips and memes about the situation. Russia won, Surkov students won. Media addiction and images population. Simulacra of resistance. Symbolism gumbo served to We The People. Right vs. left one-bit brainrot. The Founding Fathers did not put "left and right" into teachings. 13 steps up the pyramid is not logic of bi-polar left vs. right.

ANYTHING to avoid dealing with the Fox News media cult problem, the Reddit media cult problems. Very top of the front page of Reddit. The government has the right to change their buildings. The problem is We The People who prize self-harm to the nation. Who react to everything instead of standing up for goodness. This is more simulacra of resistance. The wing of the White House is already torn down.

Denial of destruction of NATO, denial of Russia. Donald Trump is incredibly strong at wrecking the future of the USA in service to Putin mental programming since year 2013. People have given up on science leadership and nonfiction. "Amusing Ourselves to Death" 1985 book by Neil Postman explains all the denial people have, the addiction to touch-device media content. Trump provides nonstop fiction-based leadership into self-harm. This isn't weak, it is a force nobody can stop. Like **calling cancer "weak"**, or calling a nuclear bomb wrecking a city "weak". It's a **fundamental misunderstanding of reality and truth** to declare Trump as a society-wide / population-wide force of "weak". This speech "decimated" nothing, it added to the bullshit, added to misunderstandings, added to the pile of fiction content, added to anti-reality about the situation. Putin has wrecked the USA via the IRA since year 2013. Denial abounds. Absolute denial of reality an the real situation.

With whats is going on in USA and Russia, this serves to make it only the Nazi Germany issue and not a human brain issue. Ignores Taliban, ignores Pol Pot, etc. So much Hollywood media about Nazi that people are deflecting all the religion-based issues of Christians in Germany attacking Jews, Christians in Russia attacking Ukraine, Christians in USA attacking goodness itself. Amusement-washing / meme-washing. And using a black skin person as a "baddie" in Germany....

The media ecology crisis goes far beyond one President. [Ted Koppel book published in **year 2015**](https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Ted_Koppel.md) which is many days before Trump took office in January 2017. Fox News fiction vs. Reddit fiction, the addiction to fiction vs. nonfiction. What Carl Sagan wrote about to public in January 1994 and expanded upon in 1995 book. The President doesn't run every aspect of every day, but addiction to Fox News 24-hour fiction dives people around you all day of every day into badness.

Hate that hate that hate spiral. This is like "Merry Christmas is now forbidden" simulacra in USA about Starbucks coffee. Hate is the religion of Nazi, the idea of adding more hate lessons to Nazi people is a realization we had as a society February 28, 1954. War is bad. Bad is bad. Cheering it on as entertainment with "when the" images. Hate itself is the problem. We ALL need to be [asserting and repeating The 1954 Equation.](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) - MAGA was built on hate. And worse, the Russian IRA has been seeding these out-group hate patterns with Cambridge Analytica doctors since year 2013. We swim in nonstop hate humans messages, love technology machine messages. MAGA swims in them, Reddit swims in them, endless prizing of hate. Hate vs. hate. Hate harder, all around.

Demolishing headline bullshit. The clip shows people are in denial. It is a wake up call of pointing people good from bad. "Good news" framing subreddit name. Bullshit. It is a call for change of direction, the news is terrible. Every day is worse than the previous day. World Series is going on, sports are not essential to life and democracy and people will not face up to entertainment addiction. Video games, sports games, meme games. People (We The People) are drunk and blow their minds out on horrible use of language that this is "demolishing" Trump.

Another simulacra of Resistance, that exchanging insults is the way out of a total mockery that Russia initiated since year 2013. A person who wants 40 million people to go without food but on Elon Musk Twitter has the decency of conduct to self-censor the word "fucking". It is mind-fuck content, corrupt mindset, and Reddit eats it up that a shit for shit flinging reply is "murder" by words. The murder is the feedback loop, shared on Reddit to feed Reddit society entertainment addictions. People who LOL-wash and amusement-wash away the situation as engaging ARG / touch device screen game. For the thrills of mocking itself.

Amusement mill Reddit has been entertainment-washing Trump amusement-washing Trumpism / MAGA / Russian information warfare since 2014 when stories about Ukraine and new Kremlin media methods. People eat it up, addiction to sports-think amusements and images are the very mechanism of Putin and Trump power using Surkov techniques. A poster! Simulacra of resistance. Not educating people in Surkov techniques, nonfiction learning of how all this has gone so far for USA addiction to a ballroom of entertainment / venue addiction / dancing images and presentation addictions.

Repeating over and over extremely simplistic interpretations of the problem. Filter-bubble is the greater issue going on in October 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble - people in USA are suffering from EXTREME INFORMATION OVERLOAD, and have reverted to Twitter-think mindsets, conditioned by the doctors / psychologists / psychiatrists of Cambridge Analytica. Bombarded by Levant conflicts of October 7 2023 Quran science fiction vs. Torah science fiction. Media ecology learning was abandoned, simple-think Twitter messaging ruling mindsets. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1954 equation abandoned. Goodness itself not prized, hate is prized. We (USA We The People, Pluribus) are in a contest of "hate harder" triggered by the Russian Internet Research Agency infiltration of Reddit and Twitter and Facebook and EVERYWHERE since **year 2013**! https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 the simulacra of avoiding nonfiction and comprehension have taken over!

There is a true reality beyond the simulacra. All the time wasted in the simulacra, Reddit ARG screen game, has a prices. It joke-washes, meme-washes, mocking-washes away goodness. People think it is a win that family won't love one another, that "finding out" that hate is popular on Reddit and in families is a "win". "Fuck Around find out" is a worship phrase of Reddit society / Reddit users - it means "dog eat dog", it means anti-forgiveness. Anti-MLK Jr reformation of the world. It means Putin is correct. As Ukraine "resisting" is "finding out" for Ukraine. As Palestine being wrecked is "finding out" about terrorism. All of humanity is fucking around with hate and finding out. What the **FAFO** prizes is both the self-harm of fucking around and the self-harm of finding out. It isn't learning, it is prizing what billionaires desire: a world of hostility and sophisticated traps by Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk Twitter in year 2024 to mind-fuck people into self-harm so that poor poverty-worshiping (active normalizing) people on Reddit can "LOL LOL LOL" amusement-wash that billionaires are fucked people over. It's irony-washing, entertainment-washing of the billionaire media systems with Reddit adoption of Truth Social mocking of humanism. It's machine lust, anti-human, Reddit machine high speed message love.

It says to me a 79 year old man is keenly aware of all the servants, secret service, and systems in place. A frail 79 year old man that Reddit constantly insults and weak, shouldn't be getting in the way of younger people helping. The photo image says to me that people read the wrong message about their own image addiciton and the Reality TV "The Apprentice" problem of all of USA society. The faith in mocking, the cheerign on of the defeat of the USA by Putin's invasion of Reddit (IRA and CA). The avoidance of goodness and desire for betterment that is drowned in the high-speed photography delivery TCP/IP network of reactionary to symbolism / brand.

Hearts and Minds of Russia's enemy lost to self-harm stupid vs. stupid low-effort mocking feedback loops of high speed media screen shots and news events. Surkov won.

Reddit hive mind is so mind-fucked it eats up this Putin Surkov student messaging and cheering-on the anti "melting pot" goodness of the world.

This isn't education, this is gleeful *self-deport* cheering-on (mob mentality). Segregation values. Anti Union of United States. This is a simulation of resistance "winning" over MAGA, when it is the very ass-backwards opposite. This is cheering on deporting immigrants, cheering on I.C.E. immigration intimidation. This is television / Reality Reddit media / messaging of I.C.E. cheering. This is such a deep mind-fuck loop of simulacra that Reddit can't see it is eating out of Surkov student screenplays.

Russia and the Menace of Unreality   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Self-deport from Corporate America, Costco is the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump is stupid dumb, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - cheering on the mental patterns of I.C.E. deporting immigrants, self-deporting of Americans from Costco.

Variations: if you still support no-identity Reddit commenting, posting, voting after last month's Twitter account orgin disclosures. November 24, 2025: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487 - if you still support people not repeating "Internet Research Agency" and "Surkov" name and "Peter Pomerantsev" name as much as people keep comment-repeating "Epstein" name then you are supporting the already empowered white male system instead of calling out the tools they use. Including "Steve Bannon" and "Cambridge Analytica". Stop attacking MAGA and Americans, and RESCUE PEOPLE from Putin / Kremlin / IRA. Many more variations of the anti-intellectual denial going on with Bluesky, Reddit, society.

If you still refuse to name-drop Jen Senko every single time Fox News comes up in commenting, as much as the Epstein list... then you are ignoring a brave *woman* who is a *baby boomer* who has been standing up to the Fox News crisis. The Little Guy sgainst The Big Guys. Why are Reddit media consumers so avoidant of repeating GOODNESS as much as they repeat BADNESS (Epstein name)? Why can't a small time independent content creator inspire OTHER people to tell their family story, instead of just parroting "Epstein" over and over and over millions upon millions of times in organized priority messaging. A "list" of "Epstein" isn't addressing the pardon and being held accountable issue. Repeaitng "Jen Senko" addresses the WE THE PEOPLE problem of enabling Trumpism / MAGA / Putin.

A keep-alive of the fake resistance. The simulacra simulation of resistance on Reddit and Bluesky platforms. Charlie Kirk is not an elected government ruler, had soft power, not hard power. This resistance puts people to focus on the Reddit culture of banal / supefical / shallow mocking. Context of { Saturday Israel posting date / Palestine, Sunday tomorrow Charlie Kirk "Talking Point FAITH" religion since year 2021 that Kirk family etablished for televaglism, Christmas holidays December }. Anything and everything on Reddit society to avoid serious non-mocking non-LOL non-insulting study of Putin's "Internet Research Agency" and Russian orthodox information warfare techniques and details. Nonfiction trash abandoned in favor of JD Vance "couch sex" topics, white men private jet sex lives, and Charlie Kirk's ex-wife sex life with Vance.

Simulation of resting "the cult". Where is the nonfiction teaching about cults? Why isn't there a 3 page document, like a Wiki with citations, on cults? Why can't the screen-shot social media society (4chan and Twitter both in the screen shot) see the embeded anti-intellectual? MAGA calls "Libtards a cult", do you not see it? Everone is calling everyone else a cult.

Tha'ts the simulacra. Cult vs. cult. Thought-ending phrase. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9 How long, how many years as the MAGA cult of /r/The_Donald been going? How long has Fox News HDTV cult been going? How long has the Chritian university science fiction story cult been going? The university student is expliting media popularity, media coverage, of antics. The univesity student is expaloiting "God did it", just like this 4chan message is exploiting "Cult did it", thought-ending phrases. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9

Front page of Reddit. South Park, simulating South Park "winning" over MAGA / Trump Fox News entertainment. By mocking and entertaining additions to Fox News entertaining. Constnatly mockery-washing Trump as a source of South Park and other stories. How does this in any way address the sustained pattern of falsehoods, fiction? Adding more fiction has been the path sine June 16, 2015 regarding MAGA. The abandonment of serious non-fiction leadership gets worse every day for over a decade. I've brought up a "top 10 list" of subjects to face on and have intelligent discourse, but that just does not rise with enough people.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1pkub1v/sorry_but_you_had_to_be_an_idiot_to_believe_trump/

Hunreds of millions of people are attracted to and believe Trump. It's not somee short heeat-of-the-moment attraction, it grows and grows with time. People want to be abused by white men. People are copying the abuse, in every area of society. Seeing the power and money that comes from Trump's methods. It isn't a fire that burned itself out, it's been over a decade of people not addressing that name calling idiot isn't enough. Why since year 2012 and year 2013 do people think Mallaa's books and speches about educaiton and learning don't matter? People don't even give the idea dicusion or lip service. People are so competitive over "idiot", "dumb, "stupid" - they want it arund as proof of their intelligence. I WANT TO ADDRESSS the education and understanding issues. USA is nothing like year 2012 and earlier, it's name-calling day after day afer day. Dentia Don, yes - how about we find some 38 year old honest person, are thre none left in USA?

"The Left" rainrot vs. "the right". The entir Twitter image debate is the brainrot of politics. This anti-intelelctual behavor. All year 2025 people debating about "lists" and "photos" of Epstein. Not prventing billionars from harming nature / Earth, women still, ongoing in year 2025 - but photos from years and years ago and the *attraction* to Trump for his sexual domination over women and girls. November 8, 2013 Trump is in Moscow to parade women for male gaze. An entertainer of the population who rose to pwoer on this reputaiton of showing off women to audiences at Miss Universe Moscow. Image addictions / audience addiction to Miss Universe Moscow - isn't a left vs. right, it is not the a governing method. It's a way to wreck the world with entertainment addictions. Epstein's power was brain-exploiting people with desires and cravings. Just like Trump has done since June 16, 2015 to the whole nation. People who crave and desire out-group hate and "left vs. right" brainrot instead of remedial morality and actaully supporting Malala in Swat Valley Pkkistain sine year 2012 and year 2013 on giving young girls power and voice against elder ment / Taliban / etc.

[IT IS POPULARITY ON MEDIA VENUES to shit upon Donald Trump!](/Grim_Blunt/Pop/Popularity_Cravings_USA_2025.md) It is a big part of the infinite jest mechanisms! No concept of simulation of resistance. "The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd." - sentence from **year 2014** undiscovered and not grasped by audiences of Reddit and Bluesky.

Reddit has made it all low-effort comment entertainment.

People on Reddit didn't care about a pandemic that killed people when there was evidence of Trump's buddy Putin from 15 months earlier. How do you let him get elected a second time and ignore August 24, 2018 story year after year on social media? Social media ITSELF was the mechanism Putin exploited and people can't cite serious { Johns Hopkins University, George Washington University } and immediate family members in the same Russia mind cult as RFK Jr. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - people only want sex content about old white men. Why can't serious intelligent science information from university be a topic? Because there is no "forbidden sex tape" and "secret private jet" and "secret private island" of white men involved. Everything about Trump is about Reality TV Truth Social entertainment addiction to bad dumb television "The Apprentice" audiences. Like social media behaves.

Front page of Reddit.. this is the entertainment content that attracts the Reddit audience. For over 10 years and 6 months, any image of trump as a sex lord is considered "resistance", when it is really just cover / denial of the attraction to trump private jet life. A very diseased sense of humor that Putin's Internet Research Agency cultivated. This is in no way resisting Trump and Putin leadership. A deep addiction to artificial images, animation, video games, computer images. A shrine to the power of white men to replace black men with wealth and attraction to young girls. Like how Islamic terrorists promise 72 virgins https://old.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1bcwuxh/misconception_of_martyrs_in_islam_70_virgins/ for wrecking the lives of other people. Except instead of afterlife heaven, it's private jet wealth and power heaven with virgin girl after virgin girl in the Reddit collective attraction to Epstein / Musk / Trump / Putin icon symbolism. 

The Reddit audience makes no attempt to be serious about image addictions and Putin's March 2013 onward war against nonfiction. The addiction / attraction to junk images and mocking leadership that Putin and Trump provides overrides any ability for Reddit end-users to face their own compulsive Christmas attraction to Father Figures in the sky as collective Daddy Issues iconography. It just never ends that the cult of Trump images year after year celebrates ignorance and high speed digital mockery as "engaged" audience fandom to a Reality TV show. Nonfiction learning avoided by the meme drunken Reddit crowds. September 9, 2014 : https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/
