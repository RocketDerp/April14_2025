# Simulacra of Resistance: Reddit


Front-page Monday October 13, 2025

No dates on these images, they are now stripped away, which was not normal on Reddit 2 years ago. Extremely low-effort simualcra of a video game with very poor writing. Conditioning the Reddit audience to be thrilled with the most simple ideas and message patterns.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1o5jcm7/draxd_em_sklounced_shredded_to_bits/

WORSE: this is mind-fuck. The Internet Research Agency on Twitter IS COMING for Kevin Sorbo, using Cambridge Anlytica payloads since year 2013. Billionare owner Elon Musk and others are predoatry exploing what Putin's messaging army has conditioned into extreme extreme extreme low-effort out-group messages. Messages to hate upon fellow Americans, and to be addicted to fiction content and extreme extreme extreme low-effort inforamtion patterns. To cram all issues into mindsets of left vs. right, etc. PEOPLE ARE OUT to wreck the USA, billionares and media predators, and the "Murder By Words" reply is manipulating the mindsets of the audience to trivalize and banalize the problem int tiny-short Twitter-think patterns.

Yes, the stripped date, this is a rerun programmind the Reddit audience message. The origianl Twitter messages are dated March 31, 2023 - that is 2.5 years ago. This removal of dates on Reddit "screen captures" and images is a very serious media ecology problem. Normalizing trash situational awareness. Original: https://x.com/ksorbs/status/1641812758764175360 - the context bewilderment of this message being in March 2023 when Donald Trump was not even President, Joe Biden was all year 2023, so how magically is Trump standing in the way of the magical "Left" coming for "us" (whoever us) is. The Russians have been coming for 100% of the poplulation to condition 5,000 patterns of addiction to fiction and hate of American people via memes and messages on Twitter and other media sytems. Is Russia and Putin "The Left" cming for the U.S.A.? Is that the subconsious metal pattern being exploited?

Again, dates are removed from posting. It is a "meme rerun" from July 8, 2022 https://x.com/realJennaEllis/status/1545215153716613120 - extremely low-effort comment to mock and insult, and people on Reddit audience are given mindset training / reinforement training to mock back "idiot!" in the Reddit Title. Simulacra of resistance, that his is "clever comebacks". Eats right out of the hands of Surkovian information warfare patterns. Constantly tiny-short reactions, high-speed thinking, amusement and entertainment as mocking Americans and not confronting the Russian mind-fucking problem of cults of anti-reality anti-goodness.

&nbsp;

Still Monday. Front page.

Trump throws out a symbolic gumbo of mind-fuck, and the audience flocks chasing it like a dog chasing a ball thrown by the owner. Trump is reprogramming minds in Vlad Surkov student techniques, Tony Clifton declaring the absurd and surreal, except nobody on Reddit can name Surkovian methods or Peter P's books and Cambridge Analytica mind patterns. How to blow audience minds: It's a halmark of Tony Clifton performances. For example, a 2000 retrospective in The Guardian describes an announcer introducing Clifton as "a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined". https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/25/comment

"they" write shallow non-menaingful Titles for posting. They prize low-effort disposable commenting. The dates of this screen shot have again been removed. It looks like a mockup, and not an actual screenshot, more simulacra. The blue checkarms next to both account names are to imply Twitter / X media platform? 

It is simplistic, out-group programming, it is a simualcra of ressiting. It does not take sriously the media ecology crisis. It intends the audience to be banal and shallow and superficial on these topics and not face up to the world history of media ecology / Televison shows being covered on "the new media" of Twitter / Reddit / latest iPhone and Android app updates this month. ... ... ...      
“The medium does things to people. And they’re always completely unaware of this. They don’t really notice the new medium that is roughing them up. They think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium. As movies are tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content—novels used to be the content—of movies.” — Marshall McLuhan [Quotes from the film “This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage”, an experimental documentary produced by Ernest Pintoff and Guy Fraumeni, narrated by actor Edward Binnes and broadcasted on NBC TV (19 March 1967)](https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-film/)

Joking, laughing, humor-washing, mockery-washing. Anything to avoid nonficiton learning. Just like Reddit, but this is a leak from Telegram. Where humor and jokes are the religion above all other religions. The God of self-exploiting the brain, bashing your brin into a LOL amusement stupor.

Simualcra of resistance. Trump creates a Total Mockery with his Tony Clifton antics politcs methods of acting for over TEN YARS AND THREE MONTHS. Then mocking back. It's entertaining to pople for TEN YEARS, but it does not remove. Surkovian governing is not removed by mocking, nor are Tony Clifton acts.

Saturday No Kings Day October 18, 2025 - front page of Reddit     

There is no sustained depth. People could be repeating "1 John 3:17" Bible verse, name dropping that verse, and go after the Christian values of Musk and Trump audiences... (Musk claims to be pro-Christian). Dates removed from the images. Low-effort tiny-length title. Worse, it is "Eating the Onion" that musk only ACCIDENTLY is manipulating what he calls "Woke Mind Virus" of these films. Reddit society is eating this manipulation up. No comprehension of Surkovian information warfare.

Luigi "owned" Reddit with his Reddit account, no he didn't. Lugi couldn't get his Reddit account to get a book from a professor to the front page. He carved the title of the book into gun bullets, and that is what gets to the Reddit front page. Nonfiction book "got owned". Reddit and Bluesky *own the liberals" in simulara of image-based resitance, meme resistance, Fox News and Newsmax and Elon Musk Twitter "ownt he conservatives". Everything is simulacra. People can nto see the forest for the trees that A mocking B, a "owning" B, and B mocking A is the very mental programming that Cambridge Anlaytica and the IRA induced since year 2013. A Race to the bottom of who can mock harder, hate harder, Americans hate Americans while Putin runs circles around USA with meme warfare deployed by the IRA since year 2013.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1ocmkx9/i_love_this_clever_question/

Anti-realty simulacra. Front page of Reddit. $200 payment for 4 or 5 hours. Magical rich anti-billionaire paying against Trump and Musk. Left vs. right brainrot, one-bit logic. Are people who dislike Trump in other nations getting paid to dislike Trump? Are people getting paid to love the humans in Ukraine and dislike Putin? Forgetting the Putin and Trump meeting in Alaska between the two No Kings days... the ongoing buddy friendship of Trump and Putin? [I think Trump has been manipulated, tricked, bamboozled by Putin. I think war against reality (described September 9, 2014)](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)... fantasy fiction that drives people's mindsets into unreality $200 payments to EVERY PERSON who went is that war against reality. I think there is a *feedback loop* of Reddit society / community who is chasing the unreality. As "winning", without citing Surkov and other nonfiction facts. The prizing of no-identitty messages and easily created fake accounts on Reddit is part of that simulacra of a resistance to Trump.       

The Reddit headline says people love this quesiton, love the bullshit eating of bullshit questions and simulacra. Love video games / simulations. Love fiction over nonfiction.

It is not a clever question at all. The entire question is built on an assumption that isn't being recognized: that 100 percent of people support Donald Trump. And that the ONLY incentive people would have to protest Trump on October 18, 2025 is being paid. That it was Trump supporters who sold-out against Trump for $200. That there is nobody who not a natural anti-Trump person. Can you name ANY leader in any nation that doesn't have people motivated by dislike? I mean health care has been thratened by Trump, so people don't need to be paid money to be against Trump.

I thhink the greater problem is people like bullshit news, fiction addiction, bullshit seeking - over nonfiction and sincere honest sources. This is not a MAGA only problem. The very posting on Reddit is evidence of people flocking to shit / bullshit. That's how Fox News has thrived since year 1996. That's how Trump and Putin operate. Exploiting audience attraction to badness, shit, decepiton as some kind of "gotcha", the whole nation is sinking chasing fiction and anti-goodness. "The Media" isn't theproblem, the audience is the problem. The meme decoration of the image on Reddit is the problem. The eogism of self-centered tribal behavior of a "team sport" of a video screen game vs. another video screen game is the problem!

"SMH, Shaking My Head". Entertained at the bad season of memes and entertainment. Shirt little quips and memes about the sitution. Russia won, Surkov students won. Media addiction and images population. Simulaccra of resistance. Symbolism gumbo served to We The People. Right vs. left one-bit brainrot. The Founding Fathers did not put "left and right" into teachings. 13 steps up the pyramid is not logic of bi-polar left vs. right.

ANYTHING to avoid dealing with the Fox News media cult problem, the Reddit media cult problems. Very top of the front page of Reddit. The government has the right to change their buildings. The problem is We The People who prize self-harm to the nation. Who react to everything instead of standing up for goodness. This is mroe simualcra of resistance. The wing of the White House is already torn down.

Denial of destruction of NATO, denial of Russia. Donald Trump is incredibly strong at wrecking the future of the USA in service to Putin mental programming since year 2013. People have given up on science leadership and nonfiction. "Amusing Ourselves to Death" 1985 book by Neil Postman explains all the denial people have, the addiction to touch-device media content. Trump provides nonstop fiction-based leadership into self-harm. This isn't weak, it is a froce nobody can stop. Like calling cancer "weak", or calling a nulcear bomb wrecking a city "weak". It's a fundamental misunderstanding of realty and truth to declare Trump as a society-wide / population-wide force of "weak". This speec "decimated" nothing, it added to the bullshit, added to misunderstadnings, added to the pile of fiction content, added to anti-reality about the sitution. Putin has wrecked the USA via the IRA since year 2013. Denial abounds. Absolute denial of reality an the real situation.

With whats is going on in USA and Russia, this serves to make it only the Nazi Germany issue and not a human brain issue. Ignores Taliban, ignores Pol Pot, etc. So much Hollywood media about Nazi that people are deflecting all the religion-based issues of Christians in Germany attacking Jews, Christians in Russia attacking Ukraine, Christians in USA attacking goodness itself. Amusement-washing / meme-washing. And using a black skin person as a "baddie" in Germany....

The media ecology crisis goes faar beyond one President. [Ted Koppel book published in **year 2015**](https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Ted_Koppel.md) which is many days before Trump took office in January 2017. Fox News ficton vs. Reddit fiction, the addiction to ficion vs. nonfiction. What Carl Sagan wrote about to public in January 1994 and expanded upon in 1995 book. The President doesn't run every aspect of every day, but addiction to Fox News 24-hour fiction dives people around you all day of every day into badness.

Hate that hate that hate spiral. This is like "Merry Christmas is now forbidden" simualcra in USA about Starbucks coffee. Hate is the religion of Nazi, the idea of adding more hate lessons to Nazi people is a realization we had as a society February 28, 1954. War is bad. Bad is bad. Cheering it on as entertainment with "when the" images. Hate itself is the problem. We ALL need to be [asserting and repeating The 1954 Equation.](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) - MAGA was built on hate. And worse, the Russian IRA has been seeding these out-group hate patterns with Cambridge Analytica doctors since year 2013. We swim in nonstop hate humans mesages, love technology machine messages. MAGA swims in them, Reddit swims in them, endless prizing of hate. Hate vs. hate. Hate harder, all around.

Demolishuing headline bullshit. The clip shows people are in denial. It is a wake up call of pointing people good from bad. "Good news" framing subreddit name. Bullshit. It is a call for change of direction, the news is terible. Every day is worse than the previous day. World Series is giong on, sports are not essential to life and democracy and people will not face up to entertainment addiction. Video games, sports games, meme games.

Another simualcra of Resistance, that exchaging insults is the way out of a total mockery that Russia intiaited since year 2013. A person who wants 40 million people to go without food but on Elon Musk Twiter has the decency of conduct to self-censor the wrd "fucking". It is mind-fuck content, corrupt mindset, and Reddit eats it up that a shit for shit flinging reply is "murder" by words. The murder is the feedback loop, shared on Reddit to feed Reddit society entertainment addictions. People who LOL-wash and amusement-wash away the sitution as a ARG / touch device screen game. For the thrills of mocking itself.

Reddit declares that **finally someone is playing the game, hardball**. Entertainment addicts and sports-ball mentality. Entirely detached from reality. Amusement mill Reddit has been entertainment-washing Trump amusement-washing Trumpism / MAGA / Russin information warfare since 2014 when stories about Ukraine and new Kremlin media methods. People eat it up, addiction to sports-think amusements and images are the very mechanism of Putin and Trump power using Surkov techniques. A poster! Simualcra of resistance. Not educating people in Surkov techniques, nonfiction learning of how all this has go so far for USA addiction to a ballroom of entertainment / venue addiction / dancing images and presenttaion addictions.

Repeating over and over extremely simplsitic interpretations of the problem. Filter-bubble is the greater issue going on in October 2025. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble - people in USA are suffering from EXTREME INFORMATION OVERLOAD, and have revereted to Twitter-thinnk mindsets, conditioned by the doctors / psychologists / psyciatrists of Cambridge Analytica. Bombarded by Levant conflicts of October 7 2023 Quran science fiction vs. Torah science fiction. Media ecology learning was abandoend, simple-think Twitter messaging ruling minds. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1954 equation abandoned. Goodness itself not pirzed, hate is prized. We ar in a contest of "hate harder" triggered by the Russian Internet Research Agency infiltration of Reddit and Twitter and Facebook and EVERYWHERE since **year 2013**! https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 the simualcras of avoiding nonfiction and comprehension have taken over! People think mocking other people is resisting, it is exactly the OPPOSITE! Mocking is the very mindset self-harm Russia has induced in USA population since year 2013!

There is a true reality beyond the simualcra. All the time wasted in the simulacra, Reddit ARG screen game, has a prices. It joke-washes, meme-washes, mocking-washes away goodness. People think it is a win that family won't love one another, that "finding out" that hate is popular on Reddit and in famlies is a "win". "Fukck Around find out" is a worship phrase of Reddit society / Reddit users - it means "dog eat dog", it means anti-forgiveness. Anti-MLK Jr reformation of the world. It means Putin is correct. As Ukraine "resisting" is "finding out" for Ukraine. As Palestine being wrecked is "finding out" about terrorism. All of humanity is fucking around with hate and finding out. What the FAFO prizes is both the self-harmof fucking raound and the self-harm of finding out. It isn't learning, it is prizing what billionares desire: a world of hostility and sohisticated traps by Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk Twitter in year 2024 to mind-fuck people into self-harm o that poor povery-worshiping people on Reddit can "LOL LOL LOL" amusement-wash that bilionares fucked people over. It's irony-washing, entertainment-washing of the billionare media systems with Reddit adoption of Truth Social mocking of humanism. It's machine lust, anti-human, Reddit machine high speed message love.

It says to me a 79 year old man is keenly aware of all the servants, secret service, and systems in place. A frail 79 year old man that Reddit constnatly insults and weak, shouldn't be getting in the way of younger people helping. The photo image says to me that people read the wrong message about their own image addiciton and the Reality TV "The Apprentice" problem of all of USA society. The faith in mocking, the cheerign on of the defeat of the USA by Putin's invasion of Reddit (IRA and CA). The avoidance of goodness and desire for betterment that is drowned in the high-speed photography delivery TCP/IP network of reactionary to symbolism / brand.

Calling Americans stupid. Yes. Media ecology stupid. In a simulation / simulacra of Reddit vs. MAGA / Reddit vs. Fox News / Reddit vs. Twitter.

Endless factual evidence / examples of Russia seeding the Internet systems of Reddit and Twitter with bullshit to mock and argue, call each other stupid over, programming people the thrill of out-group insutling and stupid. Just like Trump insults and mocks Canada on Truth Social. People have followed the media message leaders of Putin and Trump. Hearts and Minds of Russia's enemy lost to self-harm stupid vs. stupid low-effort mocking feedback loops of high speed media screen shots and news events. Surkov won.

Isn't it great that "libtars" have tears Reddit metaphor messaging to audience. Mind-fucked Reddit. Isn'tit great to have them *self-deport* from Corporate America brand that isn't the shitty fat people of Wal-Mart.  Isn't it great that the rural poors of USA are out of my Whtie Privledge Wealth membership golf club. Reddit hive mind is so mind-fucked it eats up this Putin Surkov student messaging and cheeres on the anti "melting pot" goodness of the world.

This isn't education, this is gleeful *self-deport* chering on. Segregation values. Anti Union of United States. This is a simulation of resitancce "winning" over MAGA, when it is the very ass-backwards opposite. This is cheering on deporting immigrants, cheering on I.C.E. immigration intimidation. This is television / Reaality Reddit media / messaging of I.C.E. cheering. This is such a deep mind-fuck loop of simulacra that Reddit can't see it is eating out of Surkov student screenplays.

Russia and the Menace of Unreality   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raits are very little violence and a lot fo showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Self-deport from Corporate America, Costco is the Reddit total control of media aplifiers.
