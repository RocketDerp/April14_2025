For me the hope is people on social media will rise up from using spare time and free time to comment and realize the power of sites like Wikipedia to organize and share from all over the world. And get a sense of We The People creating new Public Dreams for the world, New American Dreams of actual good things and sharing and helping each other with hardships such as climate change and food shortages.

There is so much build up, that I suspect if a travel accident happaned at say 1:30a.a.m EST people woudl start hoking cars and other things to alert neighbors. Maybe a big worl d event like a nuclear bomb going off in Russia or Ukaine or Europe people would do the same? Any science fiction on that. https://theouterlimits.fandom.com/wiki/Inconstant_Moon

Humor-wshing in their own minds. None of this is funny or amusing. I am talking on a deep level, peole are not accidently using these words to describe the situaation. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" isn't about ha ha funny, but a kind of sick engagement addiction. Educating Donald Trump on why badness is bad is worth dying for. Spending time reaction commenting on media platforms just to feed the insuting and name-calling that Trump himself does with social media is not worth dying for. Children are learning that the bullying experienced in chilldhood informs everyone and rules everyone in evey place low and high in the nation. There is a sicko amusement about Charlie Kirk's death, it is all self-harm, the engagement. We are nto all Charlie Kirk any more than we are all some sports star. We aren't all people will large followngs on odcasts. We are not all Jimmy Kimmel. Would we really want this? Have we truly abandoned the idea of being normal non-famous people? Common good for the common person.

Boundless growth, 25% year over year grwoth, for corporations was not sustainable. Marketing / advertising / emntal manipulation to drive consumerism was alrady in a stage of brain damage to the population / falsehood burnout.

I think there has been a fundamental shift that we are not facing up to. Travel technology and information technology has shorted the physical distance between people, media ecology. Attractive and available women have far more options than 1940 and earlier. This is a huge change on a global scale. I personally traveled to Africa to mary my second wife, and my second marriage ran into the scame basic problems of my first marriage (where there was no distance or culture cap). The Tower of Babel issue between religions and between cutures is just as much a problem between marriages. For both my marriages, I did not have the social charm to carry a marriage without children. My concer for world peace and my life experiencce with living media eology tied to technology emergence has made me a solder in a war against reality (Peter P 2019 book)...aws earlier than Russia. The September 11, 2001 war btween religions I grasped from 1988 Power of Myth book and TV series. I returned to that in 2009 in predicting the Arab Spring December 16, 2009 culminating in my February 2010 meeting my future wife and moving to Algeria in December 2010. I vew Malala's 2009 blogging to be the same, a small-town girl reaching to the world of the Internet dscribing the outcomes of horror that in USA 2025 people are not grasping. The abandonment of education and comprehension between peoples that leads to anti-progress and moder communications to share just how badly we teat each other. Like domestic Russia for people. Like living in Ukraine. Swat Valley Pakistian Malala saw the hoelessness. Sudan. I just can't enjoy life when everything has become a manipulaiton  game of Donald Trump role model in USA to be tactical clever and people taking such pride in mental trickery. Boy, what a emss is on my mind this morning.
