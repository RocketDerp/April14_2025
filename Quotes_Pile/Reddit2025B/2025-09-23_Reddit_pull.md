For me the hope is people on social media will rise up from using spare time and free time to comment and realize the power of sites like Wikipedia to organize and share from all over the world. And get a sense of We The People creating new Public Dreams for the world, New American Dreams of actual good things and sharing and helping each other with hardships such as climate change and food shortages.

There is so much build up, that I suspect if a travel accident happaned at say 1:30a.a.m EST people woudl start hoking cars and other things to alert neighbors. Maybe a big worl d event like a nuclear bomb going off in Russia or Ukaine or Europe people would do the same? Any science fiction on that. https://theouterlimits.fandom.com/wiki/Inconstant_Moon

Humor-wshing in their own minds. None of this is funny or amusing. I am talking on a deep level, peole are not accidently using these words to describe the situaation. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" isn't about ha ha funny, but a kind of sick engagement addiction. Educating Donald Trump on why badness is bad is worth dying for. Spending time reaction commenting on media platforms just to feed the insuting and name-calling that Trump himself does with social media is not worth dying for. Children are learning that the bullying experienced in chilldhood informs everyone and rules everyone in evey place low and high in the nation. There is a sicko amusement about Charlie Kirk's death, it is all self-harm, the engagement. We are nto all Charlie Kirk any more than we are all some sports star. We aren't all people will large followngs on odcasts. We are not all Jimmy Kimmel. Would we really want this? Have we truly abandoned the idea of being normal non-famous people? Common good for the common person.

I think there has been a fundamental shift that we are not facing up to. Travel technology and information technology has shorted the physical distance between people, media ecology. Attractive and available women have far more options than 1940 and earlier. This is a huge change on a global scale. I personally traveled to Africa to mary my second wife, and my second marriage ran into the scame basic problems of my first marriage (where there was no distance or culture cap). The Tower of Babel issue between religions and between cutures is just as much a problem between marriages. For both my marriages, I did not have the social charm to carry a marriage without children. My concer for world peace and my life experiencce with living media eology tied to technology emergence has made me a solder in a war against reality (Peter P 2019 book)...aws earlier than Russia. The September 11, 2001 war btween religions I grasped from 1988 Power of Myth book and TV series. I returned to that in 2009 in predicting the Arab Spring December 16, 2009 culminating in my February 2010 meeting my future wife and moving to Algeria in December 2010. I vew Malala's 2009 blogging to be the same, a small-town girl reaching to the world of the Internet dscribing the outcomes of horror that in USA 2025 people are not grasping. The abandonment of education and comprehension between peoples that leads to anti-progress and moder communications to share just how badly we teat each other. Like domestic Russia for people. Like living in Ukraine. Swat Valley Pakistian Malala saw the hoelessness. Sudan. I just can't enjoy life when everything has become a manipulaiton  game of Donald Trump role model in USA to be tactical clever and people taking such pride in mental trickery. Boy, what a emss is on my mind this morning. I think without world peace there is an anxiety that the technology that humanity keeps furthering is going to be used to express hate / terrorism / systemic crushing of goodness in life. What MLK Jr said about us not being good enough as peoples. .. .. ... February 28, 1954: "The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Living in a world that is so competitive that it is constantly dog eat dog attitue towards strangers is funamentally mising out on the joy and goodness in life. Driving people into self harmlike Russia's Putin and USA's Trump values is a loss of goodness. Goodness itself has been abnadoned. Much like we have harmed nature with toxic pollution and killing off animals and forests. We are afraid of love. We mock John Lennon's Imagine song. People believe in heaven after death but are afraid of leaving hate behind in history as a mistaken lesson parents hand down to children. There is a kind of energy that followers of Trump get from hate, a kind of enagement peole get Hate toward Trump. But I don't think any of this is authentic joy and compassion. We would be better in a virtual world of Ready Player One thatn the world of 2025 Hate Groups defind by their hate of other Hate Groups. In USA, right now, if I were age 23 looking to get married and raise children... how grim is it? Parenting in Palestine in year 2024. At some point, it bexomes your job to convince all humanity that nobody should live in Palestine 2024 state of hopeless future. Why would you want to live that way. Revenge against a one-day terrorist act is just not that rewarding. Elimianting terror thorugh mutual equality seems far more enjoyable. My travels were enjoyable. My witnessing people attracted to mafia state / Russia values... not enjoyable. That same MLK quote in the previous comment...

Clergy has rasied people to believe there is a devil and a god, and you can choose which team there is. That playing team satan and team devil is a valid choice. That there are "two sides" to every issue, and evil and badness is a perfectly good choice. War and peace, take your pick, both good choices. It is a fundmantal failure to think being greedy and wrecking the Earth in conquest of animals and nature is a good choice. Dumping toxic poison all over the world and creating so much pollution that we are altering the climate to the point of self-harm. Good and bad are not equal choices. We should be chooosing between good idea one and good idea two and good idea three, which is not tirvial or easy. People who think murder / war / killing / starving out others / making other people homeless is a valid choice have been paerented (as both children and adults) with a major misunderstanding. Hate is self-harm to humanity in total.

Reddit since March 2013 is a training ground for such information warfare / messaging / communications techniques. Surkovian Russian methods.

People have this attitude that hate and dehumanization are fun sport and rewarding. That humiliating and wrecking other people is enjoyable. I think it is a failure to convey the meaning of the words joy and fun. People who flock to war, desire to wreck planet Earth and harm animals and harm people seem to not grasp goodness itself. Being evil and adopting the fiction character of Satan as a job / business isn't enjoyable.

Raised by a Levant clergy teaching that Statan and God are both equal choices. Instead of choosing between millions of positive options, you are taught that the Devil / Satan role model fiction character is a valid and good choice. To admire Hitler and Putin as just as valid of a choice as any other profession.

Bluesky and Reddit social media communities won't do acts of protest that get to the heart of Donald Trump: Reality TV entertainemnt, social media entertainment. Fiction addictions to anti-science fiction content. People won't become serious and sustain repeating important and serious topic. People in USA using free time and spare time of social media won't address that we are amusing ourselves to death as described by Neil Postman in his 1985 book. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death

https://old.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1nohgso/arrests_happening_this_morning_in_nyc/nfrl3dx/

It is a huge mistake to think everyone knows that they are being deceived, manipulated, that these are lies. It is a mistake to assume Trump realizes he is being lied to by Putin. Trump trusts Putin. White House staff trusts Putin. A cult of falsehoods, cult of fiction messages. Just like people in Palestine don't realize they are being lied to by Mosque clergy who does not comprehend that the Quran stories are science fictions tories, not science factual nonfiction. Humanity has a TERRIBLE track record of facing science nonfiction when given choices of far more entertaining storytelling like Putin and Trump and RFK Jr offer. People are afraid to stand up and offer lessons on goodness itself, they consider it weak to speak of goodness. February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate." - Martin Luther King Jr.

People can not stop their laugh-washing of Doanld Trump. ... ... ... “What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. **We watch him, by ours**. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a **perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. ” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985

Fox News does not give suicaces of bribe cash to the Fox News audience. Reddit meme addicts are not paid by Reddit owners. Terrorist Mosques do not pay audience members to read the Quran fiction storytelling.

Abscence of links, author names, book titles, just geneating low-effort comment messages on Reddit by the millions to drown out any organized and sustained focus on nonfiction learning of important topics. “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

That was my experience with world travel and choosing locations. Had more come-on from strangers I met on airplanes or hotel bars. The bigger lesson is what Reddit says about rule 1 and rule 2 as a man. Be attractive and be attractive. I've worked with single men that I've witnessed women come into work every day trying to ask them out, customers ask them out. Not common, but I worked at 7 diffrent businesses between age 16 and 21 and I personally knew two guys that women would instantly ask out for dates. One was a business partner of mine who ran a computer shop. Like 1 in 50 men are like this maybe. Hard to quantify. As only a certain number of men where I was ina position to actually witness it my own self and not just be pure information / storytelling.

The contradiction is the very means of creating a cult. The Bible has a "good guy" God and a bad guy Satan / Devil. Who created Satan? God did. Romans 11:32 verse spells out this paradox and is the heart of James Joyce's work.

This comment is wrong. People are confusing bi-poloar diagnosis of a single person with bi-poloar mob mentality of a group. The behaviors can be the same, but this bi-polar person thinks it is being misued because we do not teach mental disorders of cults / religions / groups / mobs / clubs / corporations / organizations of people. Scientology for example, wedo not educate people, welet predatory organizations manipulate people without self-awareness. Sports fans can go into media mania when their team wins or loos, "football holligan" behaviors / etc.

Texan Rick Roderick of Duke University in year 1993: "But it’s certainly a good demand to place upon, ah, your society, its leaders, and so on. The trouble is, just as I have stated before, we are blocked. We are blocked **in a way by an unprecedented structure of what I have called here… sort of… cynical, sceptical reason. To me it’s historically unmatched. I have never read or heard of a period like this one. Now, I have read about many historical periods.** But not one in which you can talk to young people the way you can at the college level today, and find out that they believe… nothing. Want… nothing. Hope… nothing. Expect… nothing. Dream… nothing. Desire… nothing. Push ’em far enough and they’ll say: “Yeah, I gotta get a job. Spent a lot of money at Duke.” That’s not what I am talking about here. They hope nothing. Expect nothing. Dream nothing. Desire nothing. And it is a fair question to ask whether a society that produces this reaction in its young is worthy of existence at all. It really is. It’s worth asking that. Whether it’s worth being here at all. And my criticism of this society couldn’t get more bitter than it is in that case. It couldn’t possibly be. Remember, I am talking about the young I have encountered at Duke. These are privileged youth. At an elite southern school. Mostly white, mostly upper-middle to upper class." https://rickroderick.org/304-marcuse-and-one-dimensional-man-1993/

Trump is a fiction storyteller. He entertains people and the audience reacts like none of this anti-science is going to blow up in their face, because people think it isn't reality itself. Media addicts view it like sports, not real world. He is viewed as a fiction content source. Addiction to fiction drives society. ... ... ...  “We’ve arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces. I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don’t know anything about it? Science is more than a body of knowledge, it’s a way of thinking. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions to interrogate those who tell us something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we’re up for grabs for the next charlatan political or religious leader who comes ambling along. It’s a thing that Jefferson lay great stress on. It wasn’t enough, he said, to enshrine some rights in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the people had to be educated and they have to practice their skepticism and their education. Otherwise, we don’t run the government, the government runs us." — Carl Sagan (who died in late 1996)

That's the heart of Russian Surkov media techniques. Alas, social media users can not engage nonfiction on this and all get on the same page of published 2014 writings. Described more than a decade ago in year 2014: "He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics. His aim is to undermine peoples' perceptions of the world, so they never know what is really happening. Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads to liberal human rights groups. He even backed parties that were opposed to President Putin. But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year." https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

"Russia thought they'd be done years ago." exactly the opposite. Crating media cults is the deepest objective.

"It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. **The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war**, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - BBC Adam Curtis. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

Did everyone forget [the Twitter / Elon Musk / Truth Social back in January 20, 2025](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/summer-reads/article/2025/07/20/the-day-silicon-valley-s-oligarchs-kissed-trump-s-ring_6743557_183.html)? Much of the change in USA is all about technoogy love and abandonment of humanism. Machines are loved, poor unwanted humans hated. Policies in Palestine, hate the poor unwanted humans, love the land messaging. https://time.com/7212848/trump-gaza-own/ USA cut health care and hate the humans, love the Truth Social and Reddit machines and Apple iPhones. ... ... ... “a **peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world**. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

Maximum Putinization. ... ... ... "It is a mistake to believe that Putin wants to lower a new Iron Curtain, build a new Berlin Wall and pursue a policy of isolationism," Morozov wrote in Colta.ru. "On the contrary, Putin is creating a new Comintern. This is not isolationism, but rather **the maximum Putinization of the world**. The Comintern was a complex system that worked with ideologically sympathetic intellectuals and politicians. What we are seeing now is not an attempt to restore the past, but the creation of an entirely new hegemony." - December 20, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

Action fiction drama for media devices and Reddit / Trtuh Social / Bluesky audiences. ... ... ... "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare". By Peter Pomerantsev. September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET. “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Stop entertainment on social media. Using free time and spare time to make millions of low-effort comments on meme sites like Bluesky and Reddit. Start using sites to assert nonfition learning. MAGA hates upon non-MAGA and now everyone hates back at MAGA. Nobody is sincerely teaching humanism, nobody is sincerely teaching fiction Bible literacy, nobody is sincrely teaching remedial morality in a crisis created by Russian Internet Research Agency invding media platforms with Cambridge Analytica payloads.
