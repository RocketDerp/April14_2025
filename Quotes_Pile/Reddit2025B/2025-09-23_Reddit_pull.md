For me the hope is people on social media will rise up from using spare time and free time to comment and realize the power of sites like Wikipedia to organize and share from all over the world. And get a sense of We The People creating new Public Dreams for the world, New American Dreams of actual good things and sharing and helping each other with hardships such as climate change and food shortages.

There is so much build up, that I suspect if a travel accident happaned at say 1:30a.a.m EST people woudl start hoking cars and other things to alert neighbors. Maybe a big worl d event like a nuclear bomb going off in Russia or Ukaine or Europe people would do the same? Any science fiction on that. https://theouterlimits.fandom.com/wiki/Inconstant_Moon

Humor-wshing in their own minds. None of this is funny or amusing. I am talking on a deep level, peole are not accidently using these words to describe the situaation. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" isn't about ha ha funny, but a kind of sick engagement addiction. Educating Donald Trump on why badness is bad is worth dying for. Spending time reaction commenting on media platforms just to feed the insuting and name-calling that Trump himself does with social media is not worth dying for. Children are learning that the bullying experienced in chilldhood informs everyone and rules everyone in evey place low and high in the nation. There is a sicko amusement about Charlie Kirk's death, it is all self-harm, the engagement. We are nto all Charlie Kirk any more than we are all some sports star. We aren't all people will large followngs on odcasts. We are not all Jimmy Kimmel. Would we really want this? Have we truly abandoned the idea of being normal non-famous people? Common good for the common person.

I think there has been a fundamental shift that we are not facing up to. Travel technology and information technology has shorted the physical distance between people, media ecology. Attractive and available women have far more options than 1940 and earlier. This is a huge change on a global scale. I personally traveled to Africa to mary my second wife, and my second marriage ran into the scame basic problems of my first marriage (where there was no distance or culture cap). The Tower of Babel issue between religions and between cutures is just as much a problem between marriages. For both my marriages, I did not have the social charm to carry a marriage without children. My concer for world peace and my life experiencce with living media eology tied to technology emergence has made me a solder in a war against reality (Peter P 2019 book)...aws earlier than Russia. The September 11, 2001 war btween religions I grasped from 1988 Power of Myth book and TV series. I returned to that in 2009 in predicting the Arab Spring December 16, 2009 culminating in my February 2010 meeting my future wife and moving to Algeria in December 2010. I vew Malala's 2009 blogging to be the same, a small-town girl reaching to the world of the Internet dscribing the outcomes of horror that in USA 2025 people are not grasping. The abandonment of education and comprehension between peoples that leads to anti-progress and moder communications to share just how badly we teat each other. Like domestic Russia for people. Like living in Ukraine. Swat Valley Pakistian Malala saw the hoelessness. Sudan. I just can't enjoy life when everything has become a manipulaiton  game of Donald Trump role model in USA to be tactical clever and people taking such pride in mental trickery. Boy, what a emss is on my mind this morning. I think without world peace there is an anxiety that the technology that humanity keeps furthering is going to be used to express hate / terrorism / systemic crushing of goodness in life. What MLK Jr said about us not being good enough as peoples. .. .. ... February 28, 1954: "The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Living in a world that is so competitive that it is constantly dog eat dog attitue towards strangers is funamentally mising out on the joy and goodness in life. Driving people into self harmlike Russia's Putin and USA's Trump values is a loss of goodness. Goodness itself has been abnadoned. Much like we have harmed nature with toxic pollution and killing off animals and forests. We are afraid of love. We mock John Lennon's Imagine song. People believe in heaven after death but are afraid of leaving hate behind in history as a mistaken lesson parents hand down to children. There is a kind of energy that followers of Trump get from hate, a kind of enagement peole get Hate toward Trump. But I don't think any of this is authentic joy and compassion. We would be better in a virtual world of Ready Player One thatn the world of 2025 Hate Groups defind by their hate of other Hate Groups. In USA, right now, if I were age 23 looking to get married and raise children... how grim is it? Parenting in Palestine in year 2024. At some point, it bexomes your job to convince all humanity that nobody should live in Palestine 2024 state of hopeless future. Why would you want to live that way. Revenge against a one-day terrorist act is just not that rewarding. Elimianting terror thorugh mutual equality seems far more enjoyable. My travels were enjoyable. My witnessing people attracted to mafia state / Russia values... not enjoyable. That same MLK quote in the previous comment...

Clergy has rasied people to believe there is a devil and a god, and you can choose which team there is. That playing team satan and team devil is a valid choice. That there are "two sides" to every issue, and evil and badness is a perfectly good choice. War and peace, take your pick, both good choices. It is a fundmantal failure to think being greedy and wrecking the Earth in conquest of animals and nature is a good choice. Dumping toxic poison all over the world and creating so much pollution that we are altering the climate to the point of self-harm. Good and bad are not equal choices. We should be chooosing between good idea one and good idea two and good idea three, which is not tirvial or easy. People who think murder / war / killing / starving out others / making other people homeless is a valid choice have been paerented (as both children and adults) with a major misunderstanding. Hate is self-harm to humanity in total.
