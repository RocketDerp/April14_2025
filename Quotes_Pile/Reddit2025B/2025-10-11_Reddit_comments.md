Inlcuidng how everyday people can spot-check others work, even a spouse should be able to look at Wikipedia and leran a basic understanding othe other spouse's job in a different business. But we abandon all that for convesational fiction storytelling and avoidance of nonfiction.

That's EXACTLY how the Catholic Church ran the Middle Ages in Euorpe. You went to a clergy member in a special box room, confessional, and told your secrets. And the clergly already knew from Bible that the "secret sins" everyone hides are all in a book. It isn't a fucking secret, but the POWER comes from the Clergy / Media System (Bible is a science fiction story, a Church is a media venue like a theater for Shakepeare's Hamlet). It's a whole monomyth storytelling ficiton of power. And Reddit is the modern Church that people wash their sins away. It's a game humanity has bene playing for THOUSANDS of years, going to the power of clergy to "wash away" mistakes. It is an anti-learning system, as people are keeping the secrets of ther inner life locked away. Instead, we should be putting a Wiki sytle system together and admitting faults and mapping them out - because that's the fucking game the billionares are exploiting. The "secrets" of predicting your inner sins and faults that you believe are "secret" is exactly what Cambridge Analytica has weaponized! This is exactly what James Joyce is trying to do with his body of work, and Finnegans Wake, "Wake Woke", to Wake People up that their secrets are not a secret and they are being exploited. Hiding your inner self is a fucking mistake and the source of so much hate in the world. People are prizing hate and avoiding reality and truth. That's why all the billionares are converging on Trump / Steve Bannon / Cambridge Analytica. The game is up. All the investment in computer machine lerning has mapped out the exploits and manipulations of the human brain. The 1% of society are bombarding the 99% of society with mind-fuck to draw out the people who they haven't yet fit into virtual machine models of behavior. Goodness itself has to be prized, prizing hate secrets is a old old old Clergy game. ... ... ...

BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.
Now, today **there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.
MOYERS: Because when you substitute the male for the female, you get a different psychology, a different cultural bias. And it’s permissible in your culture to do what your gods do, so you just —
CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it. I would see three situations here. First, the early one of the Goddess, when the male is hardly a significant divinity. Then the reverse, when the male takes over her role. And finally, then, the classical stage, where the two are in interaction — as they are also, for example, in India.

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019**

We built a communications system the world never imagined, and people do not stand up and assert goodness. That's been the overriding experience since year 2013, people do not assert goodness. There is no national idenity any more of what "good" even means for the future. December 4, 2024 when Luigi gunned down a man in Manhattan, people praised that as good... it isn't. Goodness is the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944, goodness of comprehending the lessons of history and the introduction spelled out in that January 1944 context. We keep behaving as if hate is rewarding, that the motivations that come from hate are worth killing and murdering for. Social media society could be yelling into the void of the world wide web asserting goodness, what are positive dreams and future paths. I'd like to see Trump rescued from Putin's self-harm mindsets, and even Putin rescued from the domestic Russia self-harm and attacking of Ukraine. We need to learn from mistakes.

Nothign is scared except joking away goodness and encouraging people to mind-wash away goodness. The phrase "whirled peas" originated in 1992 when a band called Whirled Peas was formed in Austin, Texas. The band created the name by taking the common phrase "Visualize World Peace" and twisting it into "Visualize Whirled Peas," a phrase that then appeared on bumper stickers.

All the bad shit in songs and messages and art, Cambridge Analytica unlocked. Badness itself is attracting people. Even Putin and Russia seems to not recognize the self-harm they have unleashed, for 25 years Putin has doubled-down on hate-breeding as the future, and the anti-love exported to Ukraine. It's all going to blow up in self-harm. People keep acting like World War Two is the worst humanity is capable of. An avoidance of love and compassion asserting, wishing for love, can get far worse with modern technology.

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

<img width="940" height="890" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6356cc81-cfcd-48ac-8406-eae0e82fc03d" /> Fiction outsells nonficiton. The Joe Rogan Experience is fiction, mythology monomyth storytelling. People aren't adopting nonfiction learning of the "real world" reality, they are creating more and more anti-reality fiction. Poeople consider nonfiction tedious and boring and want to die for creative storytelling. Anytihng that prizes hate and violence, self-harm to humanity, wrecking the Earth. Real-wrold reality, Reality Real of how we do not love one another and poison the Earth is not popular. Popularity itself is toxic. Joe Rogan Experience is popular. Fox News HDTV is popular. Star Wars with blowing up lanets and laser blaster weapons are popular. We have abnadoned goodness and abandoned compassion and love learning and people have made the choice: fiction storytelling of Joe Rogan Experience and fiction storytelling of Truth Social. Oh, Joe Rogan's video message: if you ae UNPRODUCTIVE, you are dehumanized. Praise the wealth lords with "your fucking heart". If you drag down an entire society with Joe Rogan anti-learning and anti-comprehension, as long as it makes money to pay taxes, you should be respected. Even if you are harming the society with anti-goodness teachings. That's the message here. Kill off the "unproductive" members of society who can't deal with red tape and paperwork. If you don't adore paperwork and accounting of taxes, you deserve to be treated this way I.C.E. is treating human beings. As if paperwork and taxes are natural to life on Earth and not something human beings dreamed up.

“History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.” ― James Joyce, Ulysses. **PLEASE JOIN WITH ME IN OUR ALL FOCUSING ON JAMES JOYCE, AS MANY OF US THAT CAN, AND BUILDING A WEB OF COMPASSION EXPANSION AND EDUCATION!** George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Yes, it is. And here also is the labyrinth motif. The trails are deliberately confused, but if you know the secret of the labyrinth, you can go and pay its inhabitant a visit.

BILL MOYERS: And if you have faith, you can follow Jesus.

CAMPBELL: You can. Very often one of the things that one learns as a member of the mystery religions is that the labyrinth, which blocks, is at the same time the way to eternal life. This is the final secret of myth—to teach you how to penetrate the labyrinth of life in such a way that its spiritual values come through.
That is the problem of Dante’s Divine Comedy, too. The crisis comes in the “middle of the way of our life,” when the body is beginning to fade, and another whole constellation of themes comes breaking into your dream world. Dante says that, in the middle year of his life, he was lost in a dangerous wood. And he was threatened there by three animals, symbolizing pride, desire, and fear. Then Virgil, the personification of poetic insight, appeared and conducted him through the labyrinth of hell, which is the place of those fixed to their desires and fears, who can’t pass through to eternity. Dante was carried through to the beatific vision of God. On a smaller scale, in this Pima Indian story, we have the same mythological image. The Pima Indians were among the simplest Indian cultures in North America. And here they have, in their own way, made use of this highly sophisticated image, which matches Dante.

MOYERS: You have written that “the sign of the cross has to be looked upon as a sign of an eternal affirmation of all that ever was or shall ever be. It symbolizes not only the one historic moment on Calvary but the mystery through all time and space of God’s presence and participation in the agony of all living things.”

CAMPBELL: The **big moment** in the medieval myth is the **awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion**. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. **This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses...**
