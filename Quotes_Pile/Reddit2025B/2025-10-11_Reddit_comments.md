India. We have the same brain issues globally and we arne't using Wikipedia style progress to get humanity all on the same page of common problems. Inlcuidng how everyday people can spot-check others work, even a spouse should be able to look at Wikipedia and leran a basic understanding othe other spouse's job in a different business. But we abandon all that for convesational fiction storytelling and avoidance of nonfiction.

Defending **Reality** means nothing to Reddit commenting community. People who prize dispsoable commenting, abandoned comment creation, over Wikipedia / Wiki system organization of progressive imporovement to comprehension and understanding. There has been no effort to work together and get all people on the same page against The Russian "War Against Reality" described September 9, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

Charlie Kirk was a fiction storytelle, a creative mythology seller. Reddit adores fiction over nonfiction just like Charlie Kirl fans do. People do not see the 1-bit logic of left vs. right has avoided media ecology learning. Alternate realities, alternate universes, information warfare from Russia has exploited all this. Fiction vs. nonfiction needs to be self-aware in the society.. Poeple addicted to fiction storytelling patterns do not realize they have avoided nonficiton learning - whcih they consider boring and unattractive. ... ... ...
"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Calling people insane, but what's also driving us crazy / insane is avoiding nonficiton learning. Attraction to all being on different pages creating low-effort commenting. It's a mass man / mass mind problem, seeing the forest for the trees of the scattered comprehension of common issues. People need to get on the same page of nonfiction. "insane"...

Blaming "the dems". Why isn't Reddit community standing up for goodness and asking people to get on the same page? And the problem isn't just one tiny topic of one shooting at a Michigan Mormon church, it is a Russian war against reality. We The People are react-commenting on social machiens with tiny-short messages. Why are WE not standing up on social media in unity, calling for goodness? Why aren't we making a list of goodness, a named list, and asserting it over and over? Trump is the master of television media, White House media, Truth Social media, all media. Social media society of Reddit has had no organized sustained protest.

Tiny-short messages that are so popular for thinking patterns. Russia has been waging a global manipulation war of hearts and minds, and only blaming "the leaders of the Dems"  in simple-think. The problem is that We The People adore fiction and antics politics and won't organize around nonfiction Wikipedia / Wiki style of organized progressive improvemnt of information to all get on *the same page* and stop drowning the nation with free time and spare time spent creating disposable comments that are abandoned hours after creation.
