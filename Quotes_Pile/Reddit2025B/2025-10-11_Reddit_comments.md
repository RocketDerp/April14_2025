India. We have the same brain issues globally and we arne't using Wikipedia style progress to get humanity all on the same page of common problems. Including how everyday people can spot-check others work, even a spouse should be able to look at Wikipedia and leran a basic understanding othe other spouse's job in a different business. But we abandon all that for convesational fiction storytelling and avoidance of nonfiction.

And the clergly already knew from Bible that the "secret sins" everyone hides are all in a book. It isn't a fucking secret, but the POWER comes from the Clergy / Media System (Bible is a science fiction story, a Church is a media venue like a theater for Shakepeare's Hamlet). It's a whole monomyth storytelling ficiton of power. And Reddit is the modern Church that people wash their sins away. It's a game humanity has bene playing for THOUSANDS of years, going to the power of clergy to "wash away" mistakes. It is an anti-learning system, as people are keeping the secrets of ther inner life locked away. Instead, we should be putting a Wiki sytle system together and admitting faults and mapping them out - because that's the fucking game the billionares are exploiting.

This is exactly what James Joyce is trying to do with his body of work, and Finnegans Wake, "Wake Woke", to Wake People up that their secrets are not a secret and they are being exploited. Hiding your inner self is a fucking mistake and the source of so much hate in the world. People are prizing hate and avoiding reality and truth. That's why all the billionares are converging on Trump / Steve Bannon / Cambridge Analytica. The game is up. All the investment in computer machine lerning has mapped out the exploits and manipulations of the human brain. The 1% of society are bombarding the 99% of society with mind-fuck to draw out the people who they haven't yet fit into virtual machine models of behavior. Goodness itself has to be prized, prizing hate secrets is a old old old Clergy game. ... ... ...

BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?        
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.     
Now, today **there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.      
MOYERS: Because when you substitute the male for the female, you get a different psychology, a different cultural bias. And it’s permissible in your culture to do what your gods do, so you just —     
CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it. I would see three situations here. First, the early one of the Goddess, when the male is hardly a significant divinity. Then the reverse, when the male takes over her role. And finally, then, the classical stage, where the two are in interaction — as they are also, for example, in India.

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019**

We built a communications system the world never imagined, and people do not stand up and assert goodness. That's been the overriding experience since year 2013, people do not assert goodness. There is no national idenity any more of what "good" even means for the future. December 4, 2024 when Luigi gunned down a man in Manhattan, people praised that as good... it isn't. Goodness is the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944, goodness of comprehending the lessons of history and the introduction spelled out in that January 1944 context. We keep behaving as if hate is rewarding, that the motivations that come from hate are worth killing and murdering for. Social media society could be yelling into the void of the world wide web asserting goodness, what are positive dreams and future paths. I'd like to see Trump rescued from Putin's self-harm mindsets, and even Putin rescued from the domestic Russia self-harm and attacking of Ukraine. We need to learn from mistakes.

Nothign is scared except joking away goodness and encouraging people to mind-wash away goodness. The phrase "whirled peas" originated in 1992 when a band called Whirled Peas was formed in Austin, Texas. The band created the name by taking the common phrase "Visualize World Peace" and twisting it into "Visualize Whirled Peas," a phrase that then appeared on bumper stickers.

All the bad shit in songs and messages and art, Cambridge Analytica unlocked. Badness itself is attracting people. Even Putin and Russia seems to not recognize the self-harm they have unleashed, for 25 years Putin has doubled-down on hate-breeding as the future, and the anti-love exported to Ukraine. It's all going to blow up in self-harm. People keep acting like World War Two is the worst humanity is capable of. An avoidance of love and compassion asserting, wishing for love, can get far worse with modern technology.

How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Star Wars with blowing up lanets and laser blaster weapons are popular. We have abnadoned goodness and abandoned compassion and love learning and people have made the choice: fiction storytelling of Joe Rogan Experience and fiction storytelling of Truth Social. Oh, Joe Rogan's video message: if you ae UNPRODUCTIVE, you are dehumanized. Praise the wealth lords with "your fucking heart". If you drag down an entire society with Joe Rogan anti-learning and anti-comprehension, as long as it makes money to pay taxes, you should be respected. Even if you are harming the society with anti-goodness teachings. That's the message here. Kill off the "unproductive" members of society who can't deal with red tape and paperwork. If you don't adore paperwork and accounting of taxes, you deserve to be treated this way I.C.E. is treating human beings. As if paperwork and taxes are natural to life on Earth and not something human beings dreamed up.

“History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.” ― James Joyce, Ulysses. **PLEASE JOIN WITH ME IN OUR ALL FOCUSING ON JAMES JOYCE, AS MANY OF US THAT CAN, AND BUILDING A WEB OF COMPASSION EXPANSION AND EDUCATION!** George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Yes, it is. And here also is the labyrinth motif. The trails are deliberately confused, but if you know the secret of the labyrinth, you can go and pay its inhabitant a visit.

BILL MOYERS: And if you have faith, you can follow Jesus.

CAMPBELL: You can. Very often one of the things that one learns as a member of the mystery religions is that the labyrinth, which blocks, is at the same time the way to eternal life. This is the final secret of myth—to teach you how to penetrate the labyrinth of life in such a way that its spiritual values come through.
That is the problem of Dante’s Divine Comedy, too. The crisis comes in the “middle of the way of our life,” when the body is beginning to fade, and another whole constellation of themes comes breaking into your dream world. Dante says that, in the middle year of his life, he was lost in a dangerous wood. And he was threatened there by three animals, symbolizing pride, desire, and fear. Then Virgil, the personification of poetic insight, appeared and conducted him through the labyrinth of hell, which is the place of those fixed to their desires and fears, who can’t pass through to eternity. Dante was carried through to the beatific vision of God. On a smaller scale, in this Pima Indian story, we have the same mythological image. The Pima Indians were among the simplest Indian cultures in North America. And here they have, in their own way, made use of this highly sophisticated image, which matches Dante.

MOYERS: You have written that “the sign of the cross has to be looked upon as a sign of an eternal affirmation of all that ever was or shall ever be. It symbolizes not only the one historic moment on Calvary but the mystery through all time and space of God’s presence and participation in the agony of all living things.”

CAMPBELL: The **big moment** in the medieval myth is the **awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion**. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. **This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses...**

"The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin’s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, year 2014

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give **our viewers** the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

I already can't communiate nonfiction to anyone. People have abandoned goodness in USA society in favor of low-effort commenting, free time and spare time, remarking on Donald Trump. I'm remarking on the whole society of meme addicts and ChatGPT consumers who have abandoned nonfiction learning and reality itself. Putin won, Surkov won, since March 2013.

yes, it is a message of many factual and true contents. That's often how fiction addiction works. Take for example "The original Terminator film, released in 1984, is a science fiction action movie directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger" - there are a blend of fiction and nonfiction elements. The non-fiction setting: "The first Terminator movie, released in 1984, was primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California. Specific locations include the Griffith Observatory, Tech Noir (720 S Hill Street), and various streets and buildings in downtown Los Angeles. Some scenes were also shot in South Pasadena, Huntington Park, and Littlerock, California." - much of the setting depicted is nonfiction, but the *fiction* element is the terminator robot technology, artificial intelligence, the time travel technology.

Simulacra. ... ... ...     
“Whenever I ask my Russian bosses, the older TV producers and media types who run the system, what it was like growing up in the late Soviet Union, whether they believed in the Communist ideology that surrounded them, they always laugh at me.    
“Don’t be silly,” most answer.   
“But you sang the songs? Were good members of the Komsomol?”    
“Of course we did, and we felt good when we sang them. And then straight after we would listen to ‘Deep Purple’ and the BBC.”     
“So you were dissidents? You believed in finishing the USSR?”    
“No. It’s not like that. You just speak several languages at the same time, all the time. There’s like several ‘you’s.”     
Seen from this perspective, the great drama of Russia is not the “transition” between communism and capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that during the final decades of the USSR no one believed in communism and yet carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of simulations.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

"God in this system is a kind of fact somewhere, an actual personality to whom prayers can be addressed with expectation of a result. He is apart from and different from the world: in no sense identical with it, but related, as cause to effect. I call this kind of religious thinking “mythic dissociation,” The sense of an experience of the sacred is dissociated from life, from nature, from the world, and transferred or projected somewhere else — an imagined somewhere else — while man, **mere man, is accursed**. The sacred is now not secular, of this world of mere dead dust, but canonical, supernaturally revealed and authoritatively preserved; that is to say: God, from “out there,” has condescended graciously to accord special revelations: (1) to the Hebrews, historically, on Sinai, via Moses; (2) to mankind, historically, via Jesus; but then also, apparently, (3) to mankind, once again, historically, in a cave near Mecca, via Mohammad. All, it will be noted, Semites! No other revelations of this desert god are admitted to exist, and Extra ecclesiam nulla salus (“outside the church there is no salvation”)." - Joseph Campbell https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

That's the crisis. Trump can not tel Putin Kremlin information is fictin. Trump trusts Putin. Trump can't tell 2,000 year old Bible science fiction... is fiction. Trump has addictions to fiction that run so deep he believes Fox News ns nonfiction. And Donald Trump is far from the only one who is avoiding nonfiction learning at all costs, thinking ficiton films, fiction TV, fiction Internet, fiction ChatGPT are all factual nonfiction.

These tiny-short Twitter-think messages don't specify what they see or their own perspective. I've lived in the Middle East, in Palestine area - in Jordan studying the Arab Spring after predicted it in Decenber 2009. And I really wonder if Reddit users have any idea how much mediaof the Mosque and media of television drives society there? Science fiction storytelling has been driving out-gorup hate patterns in Middle East for thousands of years. ... ... ...     
"All of you guys out there in the Middle East are out of the same Melting Pot. And you're all as crazy as a butterfly on absenth. I don't know whether you're all Canaanites at the base or you're all Jews at the base or out of the land of Nod or whatever the hell you were at the get go. Semites or whatnot, but you've been fighting there now for something like 8,000 years. And you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and peace. You're forever killing each other and sticking knives at each other and burning babies and the world has had to suffer with this.

Great things have come out of the Middle East. Great things like the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity seems to be your chief export. Stupidity and violence are your cash crops all you. And this was before September 11th and I said my solution to the problem in the Middle East is this:" - [Harlon Ellison Interview](/Grim_Blunt/Cognitive_Decline_Nation.md#harlan-ellison-middle-east-8000-years)

The constant messages of anti-intellectual on Reddit. These messages intend: avoid mental health workers, avoid reforming the clergy. And that terrorism starts with "strongly worded" Torah and Quran meme pattrens. Joke-washing the serious situaiton that the dehumanizing information people put into hteir minds is a huge basis for human conflict. That the "good way" to solve human problems is with high-powered military weapon systems like Israel does, and the "bad way" is lecturing / preaching / informaiton systems / letter / messages on Reddit. It isn't about using a letter, it is the content. Just like I'm not against all Reddit commenting messages, but the extremely low-effort ones that turn all serious topics into amusement and jokes have become a mind-programming crisis.

Let alone the Russian IRA and CA. People are standing up for mocking a government that has been mentally manipulated by Russia without even caring to explain the mechncais or devise defenses.

Good. Someone is trying to clal out the media issues of audiobook vs. book, and how people are not self-aware of how much media is driving compusive behaviors. Alas, there are no links in this comment to read more on the subject, no rally call to a list of education and teaching material, no sense of cult deprogramming needed and that we all need to get on the same page of calling out to the whole world of 8 billion people in a organized sustained way. At least other nations should learn from USA oversight in teaching media ecology before we let runaway Russian simualcra / Runaway Surkov monomyth wreck other nations. Compusive addiiton behaviors in the human mind with monomyth fiction storytelling is incredibly dangerious and people will die for fiction concepts such as "Heaven after death", and not be willing to stand up for love / compassion / goodness. Love is real, compassion is real, education and teaching benefits are real, fantasy monomyth meme patterns of "Heaven after death and great rewards!" are a gross misunderstanding of mythology.

These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes that anybody from any quarter can speak, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions and then speak.

So what you have here on the dollar bill is the eagle representing this wonderful image of the way in which the transcendent manifests itself in the world. That’s what the United States is founded on. If you’re going to govern properly, you’ve got to govern from the apex of the triangle, in the sense of the world eye at the top.

So I remember it absolutely. Washington said, “As a result of our revolution, we have disengaged ourselves from involvement in the chaos of Europe.” His last word was that we not engage in foreign alliances. Well, **we held on to his words until the First World War**. And then we canceled the Declaration of Independence and rejoined the British conquest of the planet. And so we are now on one side of the pyramid. We’ve moved from one to two. We are politically, historically, now a member of one side of an argument. We do not represent that principle of the eye up there. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason.

Look at how media addicts flock to low-effort tiny-short commenting with no links, no author names, no article titles, no book ttiles. Disposable commenting is where people "learn" and "study", anti-Wiki values of all scattering to different comment trees on different posting pages. Reddit is "entertainment news". And this book was published ELEVEN YEARS before Fox News went online October 7, 1996. The problem is the venues, Reddit venue, television screen venue, Bluesky venue. Meme formatting "the news" and entertainment-wrapping it with candy-wrapper meme images. Note that this was published in 1985, BEFORE smartphones and before Bluesky and before Reddit and before Twitter, so it does not name the Apple iPhone like a televison set / television screen. ... ... ...

Fiction addictions. Runaway Bible vs. Torah "team sports" of killing Jewish and killing people mindsets. Because our EDUCATION system favors low-effort commenting learning, Reddit trash, Bluesky trash, over getting on the same page in the time of crisis.

Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human."

You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it.

Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Nonfiction: Compassion. Nonfiction: reason thinking. Nonfiction: science thinking. ... ... ...     
“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Yes, as a prop for audience. Also consdier: Many people seem to enjoy the egoism / egomania of having a slave and being smarter than others. I see a lot of pet owners who use their pets as props and claim love is so perfect with pets dependent on them. Because they hate human beings, hate dialog and langauge of writing that people create, and animals don't have complciated ideas to express about world peace and ICBM rockets pointed to wreck the earth. Animals don't build blueprints and ICBM's to threaten the world. So instead of crying out that the world needs to deal with hate and reach world peace, conflicts of humans to humans, people really praise the love and relationship with animals that are slaves / under control of community and technology.

The video is spelling out "Mob Mentality", what I sometimes [on hashtags emphasize as "Mafia Mentality"](https://bsky.app/search?q=%23MafiaMentality), "Street Gang Mentality", "Levant Science Fiction One Book Sueperior Torah/Quran/Bible Mentality".  George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...        
BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?        
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.     
Now, today **there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.      
MOYERS: Because when you substitute the male for the female, you get a different psychology, a different cultural bias. And it’s permissible in your culture to do what your gods do, so you just —     
CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it. I would see three situations here. First, the early one of the Goddess, when the male is hardly a significant divinity. Then the reverse, when the male takes over her role. And finally, then, the classical stage, where the two are in interaction — as they are also, for example, in India.

“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.”

And that we have held, The American People, have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others... One of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away. And how incredibly unfortunate and terrible this is." https://youtu.be/08R1kPdfrHA?t=4427 - Dr. Stephan A. Hoeller, year 1987

It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**.

You know, it’s very interesting to think of the history of Christianity. During the first five centuries, there were lots of Christianities, lots of ways of being Christian. And then, in the period of Theodosius in the fourth century, the only religion allowed in the Roman Empire was the Christian religion, and the only form of Christianity allowed in the Roman Empire was the **Christianity of Byzantium’s throne.

"Forgiveness does not mean ignoring what has been done or putting a false label on an evil act. It means, rather, that the evil act no longer remains as a barrier to the relationship. Forgiveness is a catalyst creating the atmosphere necessary for a fresh start and a new beginning. It is the lifting of a burden or the canceling of a debt. The words "I will forgive you, but never forget what you have done" never explain the real nature of forgiveness. Certainly one can never forget, if that means erasing totally for his mind. But when we forgive, we forget in the sense that the evil deed is no longer a mental block impeding a new relationship. Likewise, we can never say, "I will forgive you, but I won't have anything further to do with you." Forgiveness means reconciliation, a coming together again. Without this, no man can ever love his enemies. The degree to which we are able to forgive determines the degree to which we are able to love our enemies." - Loving Your Enemies (Christmas year 1957)

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show **entertains but does not inform**, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying **we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed**. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

"the stage is constantly changing: the country is a dictatorship in the morning, a democracy at lunch, an oligarchy by suppertime, while, backstage, oil companies are expropriated, journalists killed, billions siphoned away. Surkov is at the centre of the show, sponsoring nationalist skinheads one moment, backing human rights groups the next. It’s a strategy of power based on keeping any opposition there may be constantly confused, a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it’s indefinable.

This fusion of despotism and postmodernism, in which no truth is certain, is reflected in the craze among the Russian elite for neuro-linguistic programming and Eriksonian hypnosis: types of subliminal manipulation based largely on confusing your opponent, first developed in the US in the 1960s. There are countless NLP and Eriksonian training centres in Moscow, with every wannabe power-wielder shelling out thousands of dollars to learn how to be the next master manipulator. Newly translated postmodernist texts give philosophical weight to the Surkovian power model. François Lyotard, the French theoretician of postmodernism, began to be translated in Russia only towards the end of the 1990s, at exactly the time Surkov joined the government. The author of Almost Zero loves to invoke such Lyotardian concepts as the breakdown of grand cultural narratives and the fragmentation of truth: ideas that still sound quite fresh in Russia." - October 20, 2011 - https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.”

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Everything is fiction... what is everyone doing online? Flocking to the fiction. Do you see people using serious nonfiction and salvaging goodness? Do you see compassion lessons in the face of Donald Trump the past 10 years, or even this year? No matter how much hate and dehumanization people see in September 2025 and October 2025, people avoid asserting and sustaining repeating of goodness.  People do not call for hate, they just remark how "the other" group hates. Faith in hate has become normal, normalized. Fatih in mocking and insulting has become normal. Faith in calling for "Second Bill of Rights January 1944" - abandoned goodness.

Let me state something first: I never smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol, or did any drugs of any kind prescription or otherwise at school. This is an observation about other people: The very idea that a boy isn't "sweet" because of "weed", cannabis /  marijuana... is a gross misunderstanidng to me. I knew kits at age 16 who did "weed" in high school in Fort Wayne, Indiana - and they were not agressive monster kids. Based on my expereince with people, high doses of coffee makes people reactionary, impatient, agressive, thougthless. Caffeine from energy drinks makes peole anti-sweet, anti-kind, wanting to itch for hyper-active video games and running around - called "energy drinks" for a reason. Are people using "energy drinks" sold at every gas station and grocery store.  My father worked for Pepsi as a plant manager, he was a chemistry graduate, so maybe I'm a little more observerant of how people how school children behave on chemicals than other people. But the very idea that a teenager on cannabis /  marijuana is not being "sweet" is rather inverted to me. Maybe the teenager is too relaxed and not focusing attention on the classroom subject / teacher, distracted.

<img width="1602" height="634" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f9fd8e6-d3bd-48ec-bc54-a85ee24dfd91" /> I plucked this one comment out afer reading dozens of similar patterns of ideas. People have n o concept of understanding or interpretation or comprehension. When you present people with a storybook media like Quran or Bible, you end up with 50 different mosques and 50 differnt Church offering *different conflicting* interprettions of the same storybook. This whole dog shock collar incident has people all around offering different takes and interpretations of media images and events. You see this with events like September 11, 2001 - all kinds of different interpretations of what happened, why, the motivation, who funded it, the technology issues. the timing issues / timelines. And you find peole who are what Ted Koppel (presume frustrated?) calls "glovators" who are popular at sotrytelling - but more of a "personality" (Joe Rogan / Donald Trump) in media that peple enjoy arguing and debating and listening to - than any sense of concern for scientific factual accuracy of reality! Media "personalities", "popularity' takes on a life of its own. There are actors / actresses who people will give anything to see in any fiction role - because they are so attracted to their voice or their image or style or gestures or sexuality or eye contact or WHATEVER / WILDCARD - that they are popular. Interviewers or storytellers who can be given a script of any book off the shelf and be popular at reading it. This is a self-awareness of media ecology at the Marshall McLuhan level that few people seem to develop. Back to the Church / Mosque example... Shia vs. Sunni, Catholic vs. Protestant, forking branches of disagreements on the exact same two books... this shit goes on for thousands of years. And you know what gets lost in all the "debate" over god? that it is fiction. People all convicing their audience it is nonfiction. That it is "alternate universes" of storytelling and people can't translate Moses burning bush outer-space stories to Hamlet's Ghost and 1977 Star Wars "Force Ghost" stories. The Quran and Bible are SCIENCE FICTEN. Angels and dreams are creative storytelling. Messengers from outer space stories are crated every minute, ChatGPT can create 500 of them for you in an hour. The inability to translate outer-space "voices" / messages / Carl Sagan Contact / fiction stories between each other is a serioous problem. People murder, terrorize, attack Church / Mosque / math schools over these fiction story failuresto translate. ALL THAT SAID, INTRO ASSIDE: because 5 different people present 7 diffrent interpretations of an event, does not mean they all got together and agreed on a fiction lie / manipulation. People can NATRUALLY have different interpretations / understandings / comprehension / effort of thunking of possibilties on a sitaution. Three people getting three different intepretations of a photograph or storybook (Bible / Quran) does not indicate evidence of liars / manipulations. Most often, it is indication of what the Tower of Babel metaphor describes for thousands of years. Our minds do not all have the same inner interpretation of images and language. The assumption that popularity of a story indicates the "correctness" of a story is an important conflict to understand. As if I haven't offended everyone with my claiming Bible / Quran / Torah are all *inspiring* science fiction stories like Star Wars 1977 film... pets are slaves / the dog is  slave / trainng yoru dog / training your Twitch and Youtube audience... media ecology of *training* your audience. If you do it natrually or went to "media school" (Film School) to learn it, or read a book, etc. The Medium is the Mass-Age, Massaged our mind, the Masuses is the Twitch and YouTube live-streaming clips. Finnegans Wake, Media Woke, Wake Woke, wake the fuck up people. Yes, love the dog, but also remember that there are people abusing dogs and homeless dogs and homeless people in every city I have lived in with my RV travels from year 1999 to today in 2025. Cats and dogs. This dog being ON CAMERA and the wealth of the slave-owner (and my use of the word "save" and "master" about pets and confinement in a house) etc, etc. ARE we all going to love one another in this damn world are are we all going to have military, ICBM nuclear bobms, biologicla and chemical bombs, drones and gusn and all kinds of devices to murder and attack each other. Thisi s a rpoblem of 8 billion people, not just the peole who are politicians on cameras, not just the streamers on Twitch and YouTube cameras. If we don't face up to the hate and abuse problems that the human race prizes ALL over the world - before Twitch or YouTube was even created.... ARGHHHHHHH. Please go read Martin Luther King Jr before there was digital live streaming Twitch networks and YouTube. Hate and dehumanizng each other and dehumanizing pets and life on Earth because of our hate conflicts is a problem we ALL need to face as a midunderstandng. Yes, there are investigations and interpretations, but to ignore the pforit and power people make by shunning each other / attacking the Church vs. Mosque and Mosque vs. Church for thousands of years and the wars and fighting and killing over interpretation ....ARRGGGGHGHGGH. Beyond words. Compassion, love, forgivens, LEARNING from mistakes, making LEARNING the mistakes of egoism and dog capturing / dog enslavement / pet enslavement / compassion for the animal is a good thing. Acting like 10 people don't have 10 different mental perspectives and langauges on the same video clip - a BAD THING. WWe need to face up to streaming media ecology, as our lives are now all driven by Rality TV stars (Donald Trump, age 79) and our inability to even recognzie the Church vs. Mosque vs. Temple vs. Syngagoge science fiction v. Star Wars 1977 cinema venue vs. Hamlet's Ghost live theater performance - ALL FICTION. The dog is not fiction, the humans trying to expess dog video streamer obvservsations in English and images are not fiction. Love and compassion are not fiction. We hve to get rid of the hate in our equations and try to find truth and reality in this life without hate as a motivator, without hate in our minds and metaphorical hearts. All beyond words. And "fucked up so hard", shock jocks exist. Howard Stern is not "fucking up" by getting coverage for controversy. Is the dog a prop in a show, yes. Is the AUDIENCE a prop in the show, yes. The media ecology of audience and feedback loops of new videos coming out every day on this subject. And audience members have thier OWN pets at home, their own friends with pets, their own neighbors with pets, and many ways they are treated / abused. Audience members have children they abuse, audience members have sposues they do not love and also abuse. All this comes into play with this one single dog and millions of peple in hundreds of media venues (Reddit inclusive) covering this 30 second dog-shock dog-vibrate dog-command form master clip. ARRGGGGH. ... ... ...      
“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

ToDo: instead of lecturing people on the need to reform love and reform sincerity and honesty globally (The 1954 Equation), people lecture on the importance of financial planning. A Donald Trump world. Wealth prized to manipulate others. A lifetime eternal marriage of keeping secrets and hiding information. Keep your love affiars and cheating a secret too, that's the tradition with humanity. That's tradition in famlies to keep sexual cheating a secret, so stick with tradition. Genetic testing of who "the rael father" and "real mother" of the child reveals so much of this secrecy keeping and deception around "love". Choice marriage honesty. Choice goverment (Democracy goerning) honesty too. Let those politicians keep secret their "love" of We The People by hiding the killing machines, secret military operations, secret money activities. Donald Trump world, that's why we have Donald Trump, people prize liars, people flock to deception leaders. People seek out leaders of their nation because of their acting skills on Reality TV "The Apprentice" (fiction). Fiction-based leadership. Works for The Pope, works for Mecca / Saudi Arabia, fiction leadership works for Surkov and Putin for over 25 years.

Tiny-short message thinking. Extremely low-effort commenting mental patterns. Every issue trivalized and fragmented to a point of mind-fucking the population. That's what people prize, low-effort disposable commenting message on serious, critical, important issues. Fiction. Ok, ANYTHING YOU SAY can be SAFE if decalred as fucking FICTION. EXAMPLE: "Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 satirical war action drama film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Brühl, Til Schweiger, Mélanie Laurent and Mike Myers." - so all these people love Nazis because they are in a movie of FICTION storytelling? Does everyone who likes Star Wars Andor suppot blowing up planets because tht's in a SCIENCE FICTOIN story? That's the crisis we are all facting globally, the human population of over 8 billion living people - will not face up. **THE FICTION LOOPHOLE** - Declare the whole chat as cosplay. Declare it as fiction screenplay brainstorming. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING GOES IN FICTION STORYTELLING. John 1:1 Bible verse, ALL LANGUAGE, ALL WORDS, are ficiton. Bible verse Revelation 22:13, John 1:1, Revelation 22:13. Read them SIDE BY SIDE. I am "The WORDS of LANGUAGE" - John 1:1 - "I AM THE ENTIRE ALPHABET OF LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS AND MEMES" - Revelation 22:13. "I am a SCIENCE **FICTION** CHARACTER YOU CAN NOT SEE" - verse "1 John 4:20" - you have never seen me, because I am a concept / idea / metaphor / character in a fiction story. Star Wars Cassian Jeron Andor is a FICTION CHARACTER. You can see cosplay, actors, 3d printed models, you can see action figure toys, but you must grasp the 2,000 year old problem in Bible verse '1 John 4:20" - it is FICTION. FICTION vs. NONFICTION!

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: And so the monster comes through as a kind of god.

BILL MOYERS: And by the monster you mean—

CAMPBELL: By a monster I mean some horrendous presence or apparition that explodes all of your standards for harmony, order, and ethical conduct. For example, Vishnu at the end of the world appears as a monster. There he is, destroying the universe, first with fire and then with a torrential flood that drowns out the fire and everything else. Nothing is left but ash. The whole universe with all its life and lives has been utterly wiped out. That’s God in the role of destroyer. Such experiences go past ethical or aesthetic judgments. **Ethics is wiped out. Whereas in our religions, with their accent on the human, there is also an accent on the ethical—God is qualified as good. No, no! God is horrific. Any god who can invent hell is no candidate for the Salvation Army. The end of the world, think of it!** But there is a Muslim saying about the Angel of Death: “When the Angel of Death approaches, he is terrible. When he reaches you, it is bliss.”

In Buddhist systems, more especially those of Tibet, the meditation Buddhas appear in two aspects, one peaceful and the other wrathful. If you are clinging fiercely to your ego and its little temporal world of sorrows and joys, hanging on for dear life, it will be the wrathful aspect of the deity that appears. It will seem terrifying. But the moment your ego yields and gives up, that same meditation Buddha is experienced as a bestower of bliss.

MOYERS: Jesus did talk of bringing a sword, and I don’t believe he meant to use it against your fellow. He meant it in terms of **opening the ego** — I come to **cut you free from the binding ego** of your own self.

CAMPBELL: This is what is known in Sanskrit as viveka, “discrimination.” There is a very important Buddha figure who is shown holding a flaming sword high over his head—and so what is that sword for? It is the sword of discrimination, separating the merely temporal from the eternal. It is the sword distinguishing that which is enduring from that which is merely passing. The tick-tick-tick of time shuts out eternity. We live in this field of time. But what is reflected in this field is an eternal principle made manifest.

MOYERS: The experience of the eternal.

CAMPBELL: The experience of what you are.

MOYERS: Yes, but whatever eternity is, it is here right now.

CAMPBELL: And nowhere else. Or everywhere else. If you don’t experience it here and now, you’re not going to get it in heaven. Heaven is not eternal, it’s just everlasting.

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.”

It's all normal now to trash any authenticity, nonfiction, and goodness in favor of wrecking the planet Earth with trash low-effort disposable commenting and satire / comedy / amusement-washing.

Look at the topic of the Reddit posting someone else did, about Jefferson not swearing on The Bible. I made this on-topic comment WITH a citation link to Wikipedia. Downvoted, no replies. That's how hostile people are to nonfiction. Which that's the cut Thomas Jefferson did to the King James Bible, he removed the supernatural / fiction elements! Expanding on the point of my Reddit comment: EVERY person should be cherry-picking from The Bible, every person should match up langauge and metaphors to their life. Sure, there is some common ground about hate being bad, about murder being bad. But on many of the elements free thinking and free will on matters like food rules / clothing fabric rules. It is an inspriational Science Fiction story, I don't gree with all the writing in Star Wars 1977 film!

The Founding Fathers did not start with French King seating of Right vs. Left, the brainrot faith system that nobody questions. One-bit logic, Left vs. Right from 1789 with belief in Jesus Bible being the seating. Fiction leadership of Bible was not a valid option for the USA Founding Fathers. ... ... ...      
"the entire philosophy the early republic was based upon. And how utterly deplorable and regrettable and terrible it is that all of this has been virtually totally forgotten by our days. And that we have held, The American People, have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others... One of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away. And how incredibly unfortunate and terrible this is." https://youtu.be/08R1kPdfrHA?t=4427 - Dr. Stephan A. Hoeller, year 1987

Addiction to fiction isn't only a conservative issue. In fiction what people call 'assinine' is common. In sports, having 17 medical doctors take care of a sports player is considered 'normal'. Liberal vs. conservative is one-bit binary brain-rot. Worshiping of sports stars with 17 doctors (I used to work for NBA and NFL team owner / Paul Allen / Jody Allen) is redicuousl when people have no house or food or medical care. Why can't society go to Wikipedia and learn about the Januay 1944 Second Bill Of Rights? One sports star gets an injury and it's all over every social media platform. Addiction to sports, addiction to fiction, addiction to ANYTHING but compassion for our own fellow man drives the society. This isn't a conservative vs. liberal issue, it is a brain-rot anti-goodness issue. Addiction to entertainment. Addiction to sports. Addiction to video games. Addiction to low-effort commenting. The 1985 book by Neil Postman "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is a staring point on how far gone we are with high-speed media systems. We have entertained away goodness, we have abandoned nonfiction learning in favor of learning low-value flocking to wealthy icons and symbols. We have eaten the "star" synbolism. As Trump says, "when are a star, you can grab them by the pussy" - and the wallet, and the power. We have tossed away the 99% of people to worship and admire knowledge and concerns of the 1% - by amusing and entertaining ourselves.

People have programmed low-effort dispsoable commenting into their minds over and over since year 2013 on every media platform they can lay their touch device on. We have abandoned the teaching of American Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. An upstart comes on scene in January 2009 and becomes world famous in year 2012 - and we flock to mockery of Donald Trump with non-stop insulting and mocking. Why isn't Malala good enough for teaching and repeating to each other? Where so we think learning and education comes from, magical sky angels? We prize low-effort commenting junk information on every media system. We put terrible low-value ideas into our brain and this is the behavior that comes out of our brain.

But people are not turning to NONFICTION Carl Sagan books and being serious!

Anti-goodness. Why isn't Jen Senko a household name? Why is it always on Reddit that people "Stand up for the Big Guy" unless it is a kitten or puppy? Why are unknown non-famous people shit upon and demoralized and few people see the problem of the hostility of cynical behaviors? ... ... ...         
"In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to **surround audiences with so much cynicism** about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they **lose faith in the possibility of an alternative**, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’.
And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you.
‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. **Only Putin** can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more **lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust**,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

“The underlying ideology within social media is not to enhance choice or agency, but rather to narrow, filter, and reduce choice to benefit creators and advertisers. Social media herds the citizenry into surveilled spaces where the architects can track and classify them and use this understanding to influence their behavior.

It is not love at all. It's hate. It is a Tower of Babel conflict, lost language meaning. What the mind is cleaned from by Finnegans Wake in modern times. It is why I keep pointing out, what is wrong with Malala? Malala's words and teaching use reason thinking - since January 2009 when she was very young. You can analyze her writing. Why are people so repulsed by reason thinking and compassion? People flock to liars and deceivers as leaders, Malala calls this out with politicians. Look around, this isn't fun. Almost all "fun" people have is some form of mocking others / gloating over others / bling bling life displays. It's all horrible misunderstandings.  ... ... ...

“Whenever I ask my Russian bosses, the older TV producers and media types who run the system, what it was like growing up in the late Soviet Union, whether they believed in the Communist ideology that surrounded them, they always laugh at me.    
“Don’t be silly,” most answer.   
“But you sang the songs? Were good members of the Komsomol?”    
“Of course we did, and we felt good when we sang them. And then straight after we would listen to ‘Deep Purple’ and the BBC.”     
“So you were dissidents? You believed in finishing the USSR?”    
“No. It’s not like that. You just speak several languages at the same time, all the time. There’s like several ‘you’s.”     
Seen from this perspective, the great drama of Russia is not the “transition” between communism and capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that during the final decades of the USSR no one believed in communism and yet carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of simulations.

The world you live in—your nation, your people — is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. **Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God.

"I think the first reason that we should love our enemies, and I think this was at the very center of Jesus' thinking, is this: that hate for hate only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe. If I hit you and you hit me and I hit you back and you hit me back and go on, you see, that goes on ad infinitum. It just never ends. Somewhere somebody must have a little sense, and that's the strong person. The strong person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate, the chain of evil. And that is the tragedy of hate, that it doesn't cut it off. It only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe. Somebody must have religion enough and morality enough to cut it off and inject within the very structure of the universe that strong and powerful element of love." - MLK Jr

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show **entertains but does not inform**, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying **we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed**. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Those cheap books have only been around very recently in the history of thinking. Television now has been around for about, you know, a third of that same time… So the point I am driving at here is the incredible increase in information; the amount and the tonnes of information." - 1993, Rick Roderick https://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/

There is no more a F.A.Q. and Wiki culture, it's scattered filter-bubble meme mania consumption.

The poisoning of nonfiction learning.

It is a failure of media ecology learning, Finnegans Wake, not woke to John 1:1. Russia played itself with monomyth, Surkov played the Kremlin itself, into fiction addiciton. Mohammad is dead but the monoomyth John 1:1 still results in self-harm of humanity. The memes themselves are a flaw in the human brain when motivating people towards hate. Hate itself is the problem, the 1954 Equation. Mob mentality, abandonment of reason thinking, flocking to *badness itself* is the problem.

I agree. And the Kremlin / KGB / FSB is clearly able to produce fake receipts and evidence from the November 8, 2013 Moscow visit that could have been "leaked" to fabricate almost anything. Trump would NOT be trusted in saying that Putin had faked the information and calling it "Russian fake news" since he calls all authentic news he does not like "Fake News". There is no information that dispalces truth, cult addiction / media addiction / "Entertaining Ourselves To Death" / "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and avoiding nonfiction learning of Cambridge Analytica and IRA on entire population (Trump included, Trump family inducded) needs to be the focus. Democracy is everyone, not one man. We are attacking Earth with poison / toxic behavior. This is a self-harm sitaution. Hate is self-harm.

They aren't stupid. The problem is fiction vs. nonfiction. People need to escape the domestic recency bias. stop looking at fiction addiciton as a Fox News USA only issue. ... ... ...

Flock to low-effort disposable commenting, call you a meme addict on meme devices, Reddit. Look at how media addicts flock to low-effort tiny-short commenting with no links, no author names, no article titles, no book ttiles. Disposable commenting is where people "learn" and "study", anti-Wiki values of all scattering to different comment trees on different posting pages. Reddit is "entertainment news". And this book was published ELEVEN YEARS before Fox News went online October 7, 1996. The problem is the venues, Reddit venue, television screen venue, Bluesky venue. Meme formatting "the news" and entertainment-wrapping it with candy-wrapper meme images. Note that this was published in 1985, BEFORE smartphones and before Bluesky and before Reddit and before Twitter, so it does not name the Apple iPhone like a televison set / television screen. ... ... ...    
"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show **entertains but does not inform**, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying **we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed**. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

"But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year (2014)." - BBC, Adam Curtis. **December 31, 2014. MORE THAN A DECADE AGO**, and people can't find these sentences and apply to October 2025 Ukraine and Trump.
