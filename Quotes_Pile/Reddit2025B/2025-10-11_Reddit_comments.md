Inlcuidng how everyday people can spot-check others work, even a spouse should be able to look at Wikipedia and leran a basic understanding othe other spouse's job in a different business. But we abandon all that for convesational fiction storytelling and avoidance of nonfiction.

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

It isn't a fucking secret, but the POWER comes from the Clergy / Media System (Bible is a science fiction story, a Church is a media venue like a theater for Shakepeare's Hamlet). It's a whole monomyth storytelling ficiton of power. And Reddit is the modern Church that people wash their sins away. It's a game humanity has bene playing for THOUSANDS of years, going to the power of clergy to "wash away" mistakes. It is an anti-learning system, as people are keeping the secrets of ther inner life locked away. Instead, we should be putting a Wiki sytle system together and admitting faults and mapping them out - because that's the fucking game the billionares are exploiting.

BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy.
Now, today **there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity**. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.
MOYERS: Because when you substitute the male for the female, you get a different psychology, a different cultural bias. And it’s permissible in your culture to do what your gods do, so you just —
CAMPBELL: That’s exactly it. I would see three situations here. First, the early one of the Goddess, when the male is hardly a significant divinity. Then the reverse, when the male takes over her role. And finally, then, the classical stage, where the two are in interaction — as they are also, for example, in India.

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.
