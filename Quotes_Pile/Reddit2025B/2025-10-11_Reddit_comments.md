India. We have the same brain issues globally and we arne't using Wikipedia style progress to get humanity all on the same page of common problems. Inlcuidng how everyday people can spot-check others work, even a spouse should be able to look at Wikipedia and leran a basic understanding othe other spouse's job in a different business. But we abandon all that for convesational fiction storytelling and avoidance of nonfiction.

Charlie Kirk was a fiction storytelle, a creative mythology seller. Reddit adores fiction over nonfiction just like Charlie Kirl fans do. People do not see the 1-bit logic of left vs. right has avoided media ecology learning. Alternate realities, alternate universes, information warfare from Russia has exploited all this. Fiction vs. nonfiction needs to be self-aware in the society.. Poeple addicted to fiction storytelling patterns do not realize they have avoided nonficiton learning - whcih they consider boring and unattractive. ... ... ...
"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Calling people insane, but what's also driving us crazy / insane is avoiding nonficiton learning. Attraction to all being on different pages creating low-effort commenting. It's a mass man / mass mind problem, seeing the forest for the trees of the scattered comprehension of common issues. People need to get on the same page of nonfiction. "insane"...

Blaming "the dems". Why isn't Reddit community standing up for goodness and asking people to get on the same page? And the problem isn't just one tiny topic of one shooting at a Michigan Mormon church, it is a Russian war against reality. We The People are react-commenting on social machiens with tiny-short messages. Why are WE not standing up on social media in unity, calling for goodness? Why aren't we making a list of goodness, a named list, and asserting it over and over? Trump is the master of television media, White House media, Truth Social media, all media. Social media society of Reddit has had no organized sustained protest.

Tiny-short messages that are so popular for thinking patterns. Russia has been waging a global manipulation war of hearts and minds, and only blaming "the leaders of the Dems"  in simple-think.

"Insanity has taken over...". Ok, so it did not used to be insane, but now it is insane. What's the cause? What's the information that we need to organize and share. Low-effort dispsoable commenting is a huge CAUSE of the insanity.

"Insnity", no lings, no quotes, no author names, no book titles, just high-speed dispsoable messages.

The goverment knows, the owners of Reddit know, your IP address and browser identifier and timing patterns are able to be matched up with other websites and advertisements on Reddit and it's not like USA TCP/IP networks aren't all in the hands of billionare media owners. FAMOUS people have their images and faces on Reddit all the time, and sellers of YouTube / Twistch / etc. it is only the poor people hiding away that peer to peer don't know each other. Elon Musk can easiliy use his technology networks to identify a Reddit account user / real identity. it is only the poor people who are fed the manipulation that it is hidden / secret identity. AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc - these TCP/IP network providers profit off your identity to anyone who pays enough. And with who is running the White House, there is a whole network of sharing such information to anyone who wants to use power and influence to know. It is only "everyday poor people" who think wasting time on low-effort commenting is resisting. A simualcra of resitance. Reddit is over 20 years old, every person of wealth and power can find "Fxiers" who know how to get an identity.

One thing Large Langauge Models can do for the rich and powerful is fingerprint your English writing and match it up, especially if a previous account halts activity in certain categories of topics and then another account appears active in those avoided topics.

"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - November 17, 1957. MLK Jr.

"Now this is a **very serious affair. It is serious** because these symbolic worlds were the supports of the civilizations, of the moralities of the civilizations, of the self-confidence of the civilizations, of the vitality and creative power of the civilizations. And with the cutting down, the frustrating of the self-confidence that derives from images of this kind, **there is a disequilibrium within the society itself. And everyone is challenged in his loyalty** — are you going to be loyal to the tradition, to the form, to the morality and myth of your society, or are you going to be loyal to truth?
