"More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

A nation that can't even tolerate open discourse via text messages without blocking / deporting people.

Faith in punishment while holding The Bible isn't a U.S.A. unique problem and behavior. When the Spaniards came to the Americas in year 1492 onward, they too thought punishment and hate and conquest of out-groups was the ansewr. That the answer to war is always more war, always more hate for hate. Technology keepsadvancing, the weapon systems alone and terrorism of punishing out-groups. A faith in prison is exactly what drives I.C.E. - action scenes and anti-empathy *teaching a lesson*. Instead of making nonfiction learning of compassion and nonfiction love important.

This is law enforcement. Reactinary society screams out "TERRORISM", calling out for MILITARY WEAPONS, and bombs instead of addressing the brainwashing the Russian Internet Resaerch Agency has done to society since March 2013.

Minds entirely screaming out on meme devices for more action violence like it is a video game. Machine video screen game, detached from hjumanism, begging for more expensive weapon systems to address mind problems of terrorism. ... ... ...

"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - November 17, 1957

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, **everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose**. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; **when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-45.

Mocking, insutling, and this Reddit message of laugh-track and irony-poisioning to irony-wash the situations that are serious. Instead of dreaming up how we can overcome all hate in the world, all Christian vs. Muslim vs. Jewish conflicts of the Levant with education and teaching... people on Reddit find it popular to create disposable comments of amusement at the misunderstandings others have. Sooner or later this is blowing up in our face, again, as the 3 Levant religion conflicts have blown up in our face before.

Yes, because the simulacra for the Reddit audiences, the messages and inforamtion, are a choose your own adventure. Trump throws in random audience visits to places like Memphis as the macro scale of Surkov governing / Tony Clifton antics performances. THE CRISIS is the AUDIENCE not even knowing what goodness is and not asserting goodness. But not crying out for goodness itself, people are normalizing whatever is happening as part of deep media addiction to commenting about this as entertainment. Hate of the entertainment, hate of Tony Clifton's act, is part of the capture! No defense has been found to this Russian governing methods / information warfare technique.

December 31, 2014: "What this film is going to suggest is that that defeatist response has become a central part of a new system of political control. And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time.
