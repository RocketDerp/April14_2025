A social media President, can't be protested sustained on social media. People can't be serioous on social media and stop insulting and joking and just say in non-hate-filled ways that they want better leaders and even suggest people they know.

"More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

Training from social media, to peel away goodness and dehumanize and deport people at the drop of a hat, the slightest ego irritation, block people. A nation that can't even tolerate open discourse via text messages without blocking / deporting people. That's the values people adore, with almost no criticismof the book burning book-blocking message-blocking behaviors. As it's done on touch screeens, not paper books with flame.

Faith in punishment while holding The Bible isn't a U.S.A. unique problem and behavior. When the Spaniards came to the Americas in year 1492 onward, they too thought punishment and hate and conquest of out-groups was the ansewr. That the answer to war is always more war, always more hate for hate. Technology keepsadvancing, the weapon systems alone and terrorism of punishing out-groups. A faith in prison is exactly what drives I.C.E. - action scenes and anti-empathy *teaching a lesson*. Instead of making nonfiction learning of compassion and nonfiction love important.

Hate-filled, high-speed twitchy, reactionary. All what people prize in U.S.A. A society that praises disposable comment messaging way above same-page goodness learning and preaching of remedial morality to every person age 12 to age 120.
