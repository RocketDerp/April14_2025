"More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual.

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, **everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose**. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; **when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God.

Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human." You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being."

“In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Mockery-wshing RFK Jr's attack on autistic people. Satire-washing for entertainment. Millions of disposable low-effort comment addictions to turning everyything to do with Trump White House into content enagement / entertainment. Zero self-awareness that this is exactly how Russian Surkov governing exploits populations. ... ... ...
"Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads to liberal human rights groups. He even backed parties that were opposed to President Putin. But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable." - [BBC, Adam Curtis](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), **year 2014**

Trump could stangle the minds of USA society (even more) by going on a crash diet and using every resource of the F.D.A. to take experimental drugs and surgery to drop weight and become a status symbol even more of a fat American who lords over others for not having the wealth and resoruces of a billionare to take on his weight problem.

Again, Donald Trump single handely could turn himself into a weight-loss Realty TV show for the media addicted society. Using millions of dollars of (hundreds of millions) just for his one body. People on social meme systems already worship sprots stars who have teams of doctors (reminder: I worked on private staff as an analysist / consultant for a NBA teamp owner / NFL team owner and had access to owner information systems). Trunp could brand it, "Trump Weight Loss" package of traedemarks. Just last week, Pentagon already called out obesesity in the public press, the media foundation is already laid. War Against Obesity. Donald Trump devoting all his time to live-streaming his exercise golf outings, weight loss, celebrity endorsements of fitness. Reddit is so shallow and superficial with hate about Trump fat jokes (and avoidiant of learning Russia information warfare based on total mockery). Hell, Trump coudl have his own Tony Clifton fat suit and take it off for reveals. And blame all his problems on obesity and glutton desires and not take any responsibility for letting Russia into the USA with mind-fucking in his November 7, 2012 agreement on Twitter. Reddit would eat this shit up, turning all their fat orange mocking right back into their mind-blown Russia-mind-fucked mindsets.

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of **'being informed'** by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. **I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985, page 174

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but **especially a kind of celebration of ignorance**. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

Even with this dressed up in fiction and playing a character, it isn't entertaining enough for people to cite and reference in October 2025: "We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And **the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone**. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. **Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind**. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost… The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all." - year 1940, https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.
