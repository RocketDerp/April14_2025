"More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, **everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose**. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; **when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God.

Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human.

Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human." You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being."

“In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplaced, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

People don't all buy generic canned foods, generic soda 2 liter bottles, generic drugs. You can easily witness displays all over the store where valuable real estate is placed.

Every day, every hour of every day, Reddit front page has Trump brand. TRUMP_FANDOM Trump's entire life has been devoted to putting his name and brand on buildings, media systems. People act like this is just a problem of one single family having tacos for dinner. There is no recognition of the forest for the trees of mind branding and the amount of money spent to promote the brand.

Mockery-wishing RFK Jr's attack on autistic people. Satire-washing for entertainment. SATIRE_SARCASM_WASHING Millions of disposable low-effort comment addictions to turning everything to do with Trump White House into content engagement / entertainment. Zero self-awareness that this is exactly how Russian Surkov governing exploits populations. ... ... ...
"Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads to liberal human rights groups. He even backed parties that were opposed to President Putin. But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable." - [BBC, Adam Curtis](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), **year 2014**

Trump could strangle the minds of USA society (even more) by going on a crash diet and using every resource of the F.D.A. to take experimental drugs and surgery to drop weight and become a status symbol even more of a fat American who lords over others for not having the wealth and resources of a billionaire to take on his weight problem.

Again, Donald Trump single handily could turn himself into a weight-loss Realty TV show for the media addicted society. Using millions of dollars of (hundreds of millions) just for his one body. People on social meme systems already worship sports stars who have teams of doctors (reminder: I worked on private staff as an analyst / consultant for a NBA team owner / NFL team owner and had access to owner information systems). Trump could brand it, "Trump Weight Loss" package of trademarks. Just last week, Pentagon already called out obesity in the public press, the media foundation is already laid. War Against Obesity. Donald Trump devoting all his time to live-streaming his exercise golf outings, weight loss, celebrity endorsements of fitness. Reddit is so shallow and superficial with hate about Trump fat jokes (and avoidant of learning Russia information warfare based on total mockery). Hell, Trump could have his own Tony Clifton fat suit and take it off for reveals. And blame all his problems on obesity and glutton desires and not take any responsibility for letting Russia into the USA with mind-fucking in his November 7, 2012 agreement on Twitter. Reddit would eat this shit up, turning all their fat orange mocking right back into their mind-blown Russia-mind-fucked mindsets.

NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Even with this dressed up in fiction and playing a character, it isn't entertaining enough for people to cite and reference in October 2025: "We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And **the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone**. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. **Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind**. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost… The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.

This isn't about who was conservative or liberal yesterday before this speech, it is about follow-up to the Alaska meeting, and last week's Pentagon bigwigs meeting.

"This fusion of despotism and postmodernism, in **which no truth is certain**, is reflected in the craze among the Russian elite for neuro-linguistic programming and Eriksonian hypnosis: types of subliminal manipulation based largely on confusing your opponent, first developed in the US in the 1960s. There are countless NLP and Eriksonian training centres in Moscow, with every wannabe power-wielder shelling out thousands of dollars to learn how to be the next master manipulator. Newly translated postmodernist texts give philosophical weight to the Surkovian power model. François Lyotard, the French theoretician of postmodernism, began to be translated in Russia only towards the end of the 1990s, at exactly the time Surkov joined the government. The author of Almost Zero loves to invoke such Lyotardian concepts as the breakdown of grand cultural narratives and the fragmentation of truth" - 20 October 2011 https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

“The point is that television does not reveal who the best man is. In fact, television makes impossible the determination of who is better than whom, if we mean by 'better' such things as more capable in negotiation, more imaginative in executive skill, more knowledgeable about international affairs, more understanding of the interrelations of economic systems, and so on. The reason has, almost entirely, to do with 'image.' But not because politicians are preoccupied with presenting themselves in the best possible light. After all, who isn't? It is a rare and deeply disturbed person who does not wish to project a favorable image. But television gives image a bad name. For on television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience. And therein lies one of the most powerful influences of the television commercial on political discourse.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

The abscence of social media halting entertainment and call for people to focus on reality and nonfiction learning is the most alarming. I can only really keep an eye on Bluesky / YouTube / Reddit, I can no longer keep up with Facebook / Instagram / TikTok / Threads / Twitch / others. I hope if there was a Malala like "call to goodness" from white people to return to nonfictoin education. IMPORTANT_A if anyone ever reads what I say here, they may get the impression I hate relgion. Not at all! I think the Quran / Torah / Bible have a lot to teach. Inspiring science fiction and history of fandom of science fiction. It is the failure to adopt MLK Jr's reformations and Malala's reformation of the Levant science fiction triollogy that I criticize since 1948. James Joyce's monomyth gumbo, Finnegans Wake. People will not accept that the metaphors translate from old Torah monomyth patterns to new The Matrix 1999 patterns, or Star Wars 1977 patterns. Inspiring science fiction storytelling. Ultimatly, Malala seems better at pointing to goodness AND getting published for it than clergy that is still locked in out-group hate as Campbell described in 1987 Power of Myth published 1988. Including hate of Earth. ... ... ...
"Now, the biblical tradition is a socially oriented mythology. Nature is condemned. In the nineteenth century, scholars thought of mythology and ritual as an attempt to control nature. But that is magic, not mythology or religion. Nature religions are not attempts to control nature but to help you put yourself in accord with it. But when nature is thought of as evil, you don’t put yourself in accord with it, you control it, or try to, and hence the tension, the anxiety, the cutting down of forests, the annihilation of native people. And the accent here separates us from nature." - age 83, Joseph Campbell, 1987

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): CAMPBELL: How many people before marriage receive spiritual instruction as to what the **marriage** means? You can stand up in front of a judge and in ten minutes get married. The marriage ceremony in India lasts three days. That couple is glued. MOYERS: You’re saying that marriage is not just a social arrangement, it’s a **spiritual exercise**. CAMPBELL: It’s primarily a spiritual exercise, and **the society is supposed to** help us have the realization. Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of man. When man is in the service of society, **you have a monster state**, and that’s what is threatening the world at this minute.

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

BILL MOYERS: So perhaps the hero lurks in each one of us when we don’t know it? JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Our life evokes our character. You find out more about yourself as you go on. That’s why it’s good to be able to put yourself in situations that will evoke your higher nature rather than your lower. “Lead us not into temptation.” Ortega y Gasset talks about the environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a **mechanistic interpretation of the world came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive** to the hero. The hero is today running up against **a hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need**. MOYERS: A windmill. CAMPBELL: Yes, but Quixote saved the adventure for himself by inventing a magician who had just transformed the giants he had gone forth to encounter into windmills. You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not a mechanistic world in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and behavioristic psychology, that we’re nothing but a predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli. This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life. MOYERS: In the political sense ...

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness!

People who prize hate embrace Fox News fiction. People are unwilling to analyze what exactly they are afraid of. Nonfiction learning. That's what they are afraid of, science nonfiction. ... ... ...

God, this left vs. right brainrot mindsets. "mockery does not bother the left". So going to Wikipedia and putting in a bunch of mock information, turning facts and reality into a mockery, doesn't bother anyone. Having all the road signs point in the wrong direction doesn't bother "the left". This Twitter-think tweet-length short-message logic responses that everything anti-right makes sense... Donald Trump has turned the entire UNITED STATES OF AMERICA into mocking and mockery on the word stage, mocked people in Canada, are they a right-wing nation who isn't bothered that **manic mockery** has taken over the nation? That Surkov Putin information warfare since Q2 2013 has turned the USA into a bunch of meme addicts who can't stop flocking to mockery messages of Truth Social and the White House?

Putin hasn't accepted that weapon systems won't change the behaivor of Ukraine people. Bullets and shots to the head do in fact change behaviors, a dead person doesn't behave the same as alive. Killing outsiders and forcing them into prison and deporting people to a place they have no jobs or friends does indeed change their behavior. What ignorance on Reddit.

Tiny-short message with 100% logic. How facebook influences behavior but not Reddit. Fiction addiction on Reddit is popular, often just a different set of fiction than Facebook users. And on Facebook, people often share their real city, their real photographs, their real name, their real place of work. All of which Reddit avoids in favor of hiding and being afraid of humanism. Self-dehumanizing.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. year 2019

People who hvave never net Greta in person are angry from information content, images and words, and Reddit audiencence loves that anger drives hate-filled men who are wrecking the world because of the mere existance of images and words on media systems.  People who love that power is handed over an concentrated in men on the basis of their anger at a young woman. Comparative Mythology releveals religion stories are not factually true, and power-concentrating men wreck thelive of women because of media content they concern. This has been going on for thousands of years. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women? JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy. Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, **they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults**. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.

This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the **Plot to Break** America, page 128, **year 2019**

"And I think one can say that it is the tendency of society in general to take the position of re-asserting its authority, even against the truth. Societies that have chosen this pattern — they are the more numerous in the world.

Reddit audiences won't call it for what it is: Fiction content creation. Entertainment. An entertainer was elected and using stock footage of South America riots is normal in fiction content creation. People meme and joke that politicains are liars, Trump and Putin take it to a level that people can't imagine. Because people don't want to face up that religions control MULTIPLE NATIONS, and this is the "old world order" as defined by the Grreat Seal. People are so ignorant about media ecology that they think the Internet invented the idea of fiction storytelling trolling, when Matthew 4:19 Bible verse clearly articulates using fiction magical stories to build an audience for a media veneue (Temple, Church).  THOUSANDS of years ago, Matthew 4:19 defines media based storytelling trolling. Social media did not invent trolling, what social media does is prize short-tiny shallow commenting that does not recognize what is going on. Constgant consumpiton of low-effort high-speed comment messages instead of nonfiction learning from books. It is essential and critical that every person in the world age 15 to age 120 revisit the 1995 book by Carl Sagan and learn that they are being bamboozled on  a scale they never imagined. ... ... ...
“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, page 241, year 1995

"unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.

"something’s different when we are in a world like that one… like this one. Clearly something significant has changed. And it has affected the very nature of what selves are. What humans are. What subjects are. When I talked about how my students had no dreams, I mean, what is there left to dream? When I was a kid I dreamed about dinosaurs. I had a little Walt Disney dinosaur book. Why would I need to dream about dinosaurs now? Steven Spielberg has made them. He has filmed them. They are more real than real dinosaurs. They are hyperreal. You would be disappointed if you saw a real Tyrannosaurus Rex after the movie. You would be disappointed. It wouldn’t be as noisy or as scary or as frightening. The same is true of Jaws, you know. I have actually caught some rather large sharks, I mean, I like to fish – you know, pier fish – so I have caught a few sharks, some of fairly good size. But those real experiences are so boring compared to Jaws. I mean Jaws is a hyperreal experience." - year 1993, https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

That's the crisis and problem. Our real lives, REALITY, are being fucked over by Charlie Kirk's year 2021 "TP Faith" Bible storytelling. Weaponized monomyth mind-fuck from Surkov students and CAs since year 2013 is not a joke. People are spending free time and spare time wrecking REAL USA Reality of science with comedy-washing amusement-washing. That's what Neil Postmany in NYC was noticing ahead of the curve of rural USA. This is the death Americans have embraced, death by amusement. Sadly, I think we will be harming  other nations, not just USA, we are a threat to the world that we have let our high-speed media systems / media networks feed everyone into meme stupors of self-harm as Neil Postamn described in year 1985. The holiday symbolism mindsets are starting now, the consumerism holidays of Halooween / Thanksgiving / Chiristmas and all the broken families from MAGA hate / Trump support hate, and the faith in *hate harder* that has been dominating USA society since January 2024... thatthe answer to Trump hate and MAGA hate is always more hate and more mocking. So much goodness has been abandoned.

The Bible symbolism of USA conservatives may have created Taliban mindsets first with the Surkov monomyth mindfuck patterns, but ultimately the anti-MAGA hate has become even more predictable.

Rarely do I see people point out that with airports all over the world, TCP/IP all over the world, over 8 billion people. that the lifestyle of massive wealth growth for 8 billion people may be hitting a limit of finding easy oil and finding easy gold and trees and other schemes may be running out. That's one way that Ready Player One year 2040 might actually be a *good lifestyle* if people want to spend all their spare time and free time online with Fox News, at least an OPEN simulation of reality would be treated as fiction.

Yes. Bible thumpers who say we need more Jesus in our schools but can't face how Bible verse "1 John 3:17" is a judgement statement about Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Charlie Kirk Bible-thumping messages. Further, the anti-MAGA atheists on Reddit and Bluesky who don't see the metaphor literacy problem of BIble verse '1 John 3:17" being ignored. If the BIble is a choose-your-won adventure of cheery-picking, why would you NOT want to cherry-pick an authentic cherry of "1 John 3:17" and verse "1 John 4:20" - why are Reddit and Bluesky not coming together on teaching better Bible reading / literacy? If we can't get a 2,000 year old science fiction story down, what chance do we have with Fox News media reading and Facebook cherry-picking raeding? Democracy will not work if "hate thy neighbor" and "hate harder" is the programming society puts into minds as "winning".

Why Malala's Quran reformation, reading nonfiction vs. fiction of the entire public library, was so imporant and a mistake that people since year 2013 have turned media systems toward Trump and not Malala. The Torah / Bible / Quran reading issues of cherry-picking hate was LOUDLY shared. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): MOYERS: “Holding their own head.” That is an interesting idea because, even though the cities emerge around them, within the soul, the place where the inner person dwells, they are still, as you say, in accord with nature.
CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.
MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.
CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about.

Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - November 11, 1957. MLK Jr.

This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical **trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits**, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the **Plot to Break** America, page 128, **year 2019**

And even if people got higher quanities of education, there is little discussion of what. First would be Bible literacy for EVERYONE on how to read a science fiction story and how to cherry-pick great ideas from a fiction story, such as "1 John 3:17" and apply that fiction story idea to Musk / Murdoch / Trump / etc.

Reddit is "entertainment news". And this book was published ELEVEN YEARS before Fox News went online October 7, 1996. The problem is the benues, Reddit venue, television screen venue, Bluesky venue. Meme formatting "the news" and entertainment-wrapping it with candy-wrapper meme images. Note that this was published in 1985, BEFORE smartphones and before Bluesky and before Reddit and before Twitter, so it does not name the Apple iPhone like a televison set / television screen. ... ... ... 
"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a **coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show **entertains but does not inform**, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying **we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed**. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

"A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty **to mankind as a whole** in order to preserve the best in their individual societies. This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern **beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation** is in reality a call for an all-embracing and unconditional love for all mankind. This oft misunderstood, this oft misinterpreted concept, so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force, has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality." - MLK Jr.

"All that has happened is that the public has **adjusted to incoherence** and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

LOL-washing Putin and Russia and Ukraine invasion as all so amusing that Putin and Trump are friends because fat man, diapers, orange skin, talks in usual ways that draws people into mindless mockery mindsets and anti-thinking, uses Twitter and Truth Social in wasy taht draws people in to his communications and they parrot and regurgitate every phrase Trump uses, because he golfs and pepole parrot that information constantly.. wtih zero self awareness of their compulusive behaviors towards a status symbol / brand name / iconic uniqueness of his shape / speech / writing / style / fashion. People think Mocking Trump and joking about Trump isn't a form of worship of Trump. God was NEVER real, God is langauge and only language, memes and only memes, this is spelled out 2,000 years ago in verse John 1:1 and paied with Bible verse "1 John 4:20". Mocking and insutling Trump is attraction to the magnetic media imagge / branding / style of Trump. Hating Trump's style is submitting to it. People just don't get it. Our nation is in mental ruin FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS and it is not psosible to redundantly create langauge to describe just how twisted and pretzel-logic things are fucked up, FUBAR, for OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS regarding this symbolism and how the human brain works with media / media ecology. Marshall McLuhan explains this, James Joyce's illustrates these patterns in his body of work. Steely Dan too.

The works are postmodernist, satirizing and reflecting on the realities of Russian politics and society." - Donald Trump is the best natural-gifted Tony Clifton student, Surkov student, everything FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS, gets LOL-washed on Reddit and other meme mills.

How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

The Power of Mythology. The dynamics of the Power of Mythology. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Monomyth story patterns appeal more than nonfiction to audiences who abandon reality / real world in favor of Mythology.  George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That’s something else, and it can be done. BILL MOYERS By doing what? CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, rejecting the system’s impersonal claims upon you. BILL MOYERS: When I took our two sons to see Star Wars, they did the same thing the audience did at that moment when the voice of Ben Kenobi says to Skywalker in the climactic moment of the last fight, “Turn off your computer, turn off your machine and do it yourself, **follow your feelings, trust your feelings.”** And when he did, he achieved success, and the audience broke out into applause. CAMPBELL: Well, you see, that movie communicates. It is in a language that talks to young people, and that’s what counts. It asks, Are you going to be a person of heart and humanity—because that’s where the life is, from the heart—or are you going to do whatever seems to be required of you by what might be called “intentional power”? When Ben Kenobi says, “May the Force be with you,” he’s speaking of the power and energy of life, **not of programmed political** intentions.

The discussions consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one. At this point, some Americans speak English; others speak Fox." https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/

No, everyone does not think that way. Some climb the Tower of Babel and look around the world of Finnegans Wake iterations.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I think of mythology as the homeland of the muses, the inspirers of art, the inspirers of poetry. To see life as a poem and yourself participating in a poem is what the myth does for you.
BILL MOYERS: A poem?
CAMPBELL: I mean a **vocabulary in the form not of words but of acts and adventures, which connotes something transcendent** of the action here, so that you always feel in accord with the universal being.
MOYERS: When I read these myths, I am simply in awe of the mystery of it all. We can presume, but we cannot penetrate.
CAMPBELL: **That is the point. The person who thinks he has found the ultimate truth is wrong. There is an often-quoted verse in Sanskrit**, which appears in the Chinese Tao-te Ching as well: “He who thinks he knows, doesn’t know. He who knows that he doesn’t know, knows. For in this context, to know is not to know. And not to know is to know.”
MOYERS: Far from undermining my faith, your work in mythology has **liberated my faith from the cultural prisons** to which it had been sentenced.

"Anyway, that’s rationalisation, and then the third – and this is sort of one of my own if you will forgive me – is what I’ll call banalization. And it’s always a danger when you do lectures like the ones I am doing now, and that’s to take these fundamentally important things like what does my life mean, and surely there must be a better way to organise the world than the way it is organised now, surely my life could have more meaning in a different situation.

Only the out-groups. ... ... ... “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of **alternate universes**, The Fox News cable channel conveys its **version of reality**, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

I am not defending him. I also do not defend the low-effort commenting that drives society now, how people are using spare time and free time to bandwagon and join in mobs when clearly an issue is getting x amount of society attention that is suitable. While serious topics impacting hundreds of millions of people like the Second Bill of Rights January 1944 get almost zero attention. The December 4, 2024 dramatic video camera coverage of a gun shooting to "fix health care" got tons of attention, especially once the video game charachter Luigi was tied to it as entertainment. Why can't Reddit society spend every day posting people's real health care insurance problems, need for universal health care, with a posting every 6 hours. Instead, for the 10 months I've seen people call for more Luigi murdering and killing - not calling for "the little guy" to be given organized voices on social media. The dramatic violence of a gun shooting captured on video by a hot athletic Hawaii guy doing sneak-attack/ ambush killing is far more interesting to people than featuring 10 months, day after day, every 6 hours a posting on /r/USAHealthStories everyday American people in sickness situations needing health care. The attraction to murder and "action violence" and making a small number of people famous is at the heart of society values.

Great Seal USA topic of the "American Dream" meaning and the John 1:1 rewriting of mass mind / public dream. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...
BILL MOYERS: Why is a myth different from a dream?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Oh, because a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and **a myth is the society’s dream. The myth is the public dream and the dream is the private myth**. If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn’t, you’ve got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you.
MOYERS: So if my private dreams are in accord with **the public mythology**, I’m more likely to live healthily in that society. But if my private dreams are out of step with the public —
CAMPBELL: — you’ll be in trouble. If you’re forced to live in that system, you’ll be a neurotic.
MOYERS: But aren’t many visionaries and even leaders and heroes close to the edge of neuroticism?
CAMPBELL: Yes, they are.
MOYERS: How do you explain that?
CAMPBELL: They’ve moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original experience has not been interpreted for you, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself in very difficult situations. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience — that is the hero’s deed.
MOYERS: You say dreams come up from the psyche.

Yes. Published in year 2019: “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that **“nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,”** and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

BILL MOYERS: What do you think will be the myths that will **incorporate the machine** into the new world?
CAMPBELL: Well, automobiles have gotten into mythology. They have gotten into dreams. And airplanes are very much in the service of the imagination. The flight of the airplane, for example, is in the imagination as the release from earth. This is the same thing that birds symbolize, in a certain way. The bird is symbolic of the release of the spirit from bondage to the earth, just as the serpent is symbolic of the bondage to the earth. The airplane plays that role now.

People lack such self-awareness. Compsuvely drawn to mocking Trump with CA & IRA conditoning. The Founding Fathers capitalized Mid Sentence. Are there rules and thought put into it, maybe, but it's like saying a painter can't draw outside the lines or blend two colours / colors and whatever else the fuck a HiveMind expects. Reddit users are such conformits with thier meme-speak and memorized jokes and film / SpongeBob lines. They are inciredibly against divesity as a HiveMind, so concerned to hide their identity that you normally can't tell if a Reddit user is age 15 or age 35 or ate 65 - and they try to determine all that from one or two sentences and have no concept of 8 billion people not even *desiring* to speak in the same accent or write in a conformist way. The langauge giostry that they are the "owners of English" syntax and style and that it is a set of rules to curtail human expression. The one thing you can't get is to stop the insult-washing mockery-washing satire-washing joke-washing of the casual dehumanization of Donald Trump. So practiced at dehumanizng Trump they can't imagine that nto everyone can afford the computers and Internet access Trump has, the privledge influence.
Donald Trump naturally senses how people react to all his speech, dress, style, fashion, mannerisms, gestures. And he has long ago realized it *gets under the skin of socratic thinkers who prize confomrity enforncement. It makes people incredibly shallow and superficial, sometimes in the way that people can be raised with certain dress code values (Taliban dress code values of women's hair and body) and certain sexual public displays of affection (PDA, like we need an acronyn TLA for that in society, except to block it and discourage it, anti-goodness)... well, how much redndancy am I up for on this writing tonight... anywa. Trump has come to recognize that ANYTHING that triggers the detection of egoism in the human mind (being an egomaniac in his long-term values) concetrates attention and power. WRITE IN ALL CAPS and ignore advice that it unsettles people, makes them discuss your writing. Well gee. Wear Orange Makeup / Orange SKin Color, and suddenly a society since year 2015 endlessly discussses skin color other than Barack Obama's BLACK SKIN color... now you are in a category of your own, and you have programmed the mass mind to be way more concerned with skin color than it was before... by constantly having orange skin be the topic, the crowd is exloitd into making skin color a practiced and exercised thought pattern. Sort of like how clothing as weapon works. I writing this, I've considered about 7 or 8 footnotes so far. Warand Peace in The Global Village 1968 quotes about clothing as weapons and the Pranking Wueenereno in Finengans Wake.... and Howard Bloom on Conformity Enforcers. But at the sartof writing, which my mind has still held some memory of in my language composition of redudancy repeating circeling around a topic... a quote that I startedto focus on in year 2008, writings of Ben Franklin in genreal, while living in Austin. Wearing an Onion on my belt, as was the fashion of the time. Quoting that line was a fashion of cultural language at some other time. One more is Marshall McLuhan's March 1967 quote about Joyce's Wake and every gesture and posture in the Finn Cycle and not beeing a mass mind culture of zombies to the change. Anyway,that's a pretty redudnant circelin with repetition of associative thinking on the topic in a linear unedited severely brain damaged by Reddit media enviornment hatre breeder reactor of egoisme exposure. What's the fucking point. Compassion and love don't come from perfect syntax rules, Rock MusicL Lyrics, Punk Rock. Trump's got style, and his style brands his mark like a dog pisses on everything to leave a scent. And I'm not criticizing the dog's behavior, that's one of the things we do not always domesticate out of the animal - that people try to. Language markers, mixted idioms, mixted metaphors, Wikipedia inline thinking, parallel threads in concurrent Ada programming, writing BBS systems where you had full client and server apps and could concurrent download a SID song at the same time as loadinga new message to read on the screen - on a 128K computer. Background downloading in a time where you paid by the minute for POTS long-distance. Now ask yourself, self, how many people go to such a hate-breeder reactor such as Reddit with a criticla eye towards the anti-humanism anti-diversing ongoings... and associate Donald Trump's year 2025 Truth Social use of ALL CAPS and Emphasizing Word patterns ...and think of a Founding Father's early public Truth Social pamplets - that he later recalled and burned / self-censored? How many iterations of Finnegans Wake should people read or speak or audio book or listen in song before one starts to recognize the NYC Sraw Hat Riot is a conformity enforcement of seasonal fashions and mob mentality eogism of uniformclothing. Now I Know Richard Feyman is now widely regarded as an asshole in these recent years and that he was keenly aware of his own mannerisms and language using drawing him legendary uniqueness attention... but it iisn't a third-party written book but an interview where he spoke of his father being  a Uniform clothing person and a recorded interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f61KMw5zVhg - and how people behave with langauge and rules of clothing and honors and the strugle of Donald Trump going after the Status Sybol of the honors of the Nobel Prize - langauge conformity enforcers. And Joseph Campbell JCF lectures on audio that I focused on in year 2009 and year 2010 which helped me tune in to the Arab Spring ... now my working memory has faltered and I can't remember the keywords of what I had about 7 or 8 minutes ago in mind that he said. nd yes, I did cosider from the very start that perhaps in the year 1725 London there was a convention of rules on When to capitalized words... but my fucking point is that these arelike how everyone dresses year 1970 vs. year 1995 in Seattle or New York City and the fucking Straw Hat Riot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Hat_Riot - when you dehumanize Donald Trump and you dehumanize Vlad Putin - you don't see how shallow and superficial it all becomes. If the only thing holding a society from mass murder and dog eat dog killing of each other is that everyone read the Quran and has a loudspeaker for prayer call in their childhood or Sponge Bob community, fuck, a monster state as Campbell called it, we are in service to society, society isn't helping us have a realization of the diversity of our own experiences and genetics. I've made my stand, all hate is bad, I've never enjoyed hate a day in my life. Call me "hyepr empathy" if everyone has to be diagnosed, but I just don't get how people think being angry is fun and joyful. Love and compassion and Wikipedia of medical knowledge - preventing diseases and treating broken bones from accidents when Tim Finnegan falls down the ladder and needs a leg set property - that is goodness. Building bombs and studying war to murder each other and kill and terorize each other, I'm not convicned the "fun", "joy", "thrill" that people seem to get from these butchering of each other is any good at all. It's as if language of "fun" itself is broken. David Foster Wallace has done it, his English was well written enough for most people, it's all a very sick joke. The way people hate each other is a sick and terrible joke. And I do not find it funny. Rick Roderick was correct, "Self Under Siege" by people who want to program langauge order of word conformity / word order conformity and other bullshit that like the Taliban wants with clothing. People don'tsee the *hate harder* and *prize hate* mass mind / mass man changes in USA society driven by the size of an Apple iPhone screen and font sizes and what people consider normal for a paper size and the length of a pargraph and the acceptable amount of overlapping waves of redundancy and circleing around a topic and how short comments are based on the screen size and anti-humanism it all becomes. .. ... ...

That's like thinking religions require bloodshed out of tradition of hate. The faith people have tht murder, killing and hat are "enjoyabe" and their "own reward". Living in a sewer of hate and dehumanization does not make your marriage and parenting magical. Having your arms cut off in dangerious workpalces does not make medical care magical. Having your children born with birth defects from toxic pollution does not make helath car magical. A few good marriages and romances in a toxic society does not redeem the hell of parenting and living in the society.

THE IMPLICATION of this message is that pople learn from commenting messages on Reddit. Anonymous sources. Almost always without quotes, citations, author names, book titles, article titles, etc. Instaed of an organized Wiki style article with progressively refined information - it's huge quanitites of low-effort commenting that are disposble (those comments on "AdviceAnimals" are out of date, are abandoned in favor of this new posting that the comment was just made on "Pics")

The Medium is The Candidate. Like people being attracted to low-effort commenting about media stars. Malala is known world wide, her event translated to langauges and she traveled all over, goodness for humanity and peace for humanity is unattractive to people. Educating and teaching our way out of conflicts with Wikipedia style sharing from every person in the world is considered boring and uninteresting like nonfiction has become in USA. The competition of being "smarter" than others and calling others stupid and dumb, including leaders - calling them dumb idiots - exeeds the actul desire for "pride Earth", "Pale Blue dot pride" of the whole world proud of the morality and progress of the human race on a plnatary scale. Like using mental health workers / teachers / edicators to convince Russia to abandon war and agression.

No, the trck has been Rupert Murodch global media network, Putin's global media network, IRA. And there is so much faith in the 1-bit logic of conservative vs. liberal. How seating at a French King should be the meaasure. What I encourage everyone to see is taht the "right" seating was people who wee science fiction leadership fans of Bible in France. Mythology fiction storytelling. Which fits Fox News / Rupert Murdoch's global media network. Fiction vs. nonfiction learning. And all over the world fiction learning is more popular. And sports teams are not really nonfiction learning. They are entertainment. Even big music acts are more about m oney and fame than sharing a song we all sing together, it becomes a profit money source even after the songwriter / singer is dead. The whole "copyright is brain damage" of putting massive profit concentration in the hands of few instead of media being a shared communications experiencei (where the sharing is prized over the wealth concentation and profits made).

It's a ficton war. A self-harm aatraction to fiction. The wealthy are content creators and in Putin and Trump case, created 5,000 patterns of fiction with the November 7, 2012 agreement. And the dominationg people care about is calling out-groups stupid and dumb and hate upon them. This is a sports mentality, game mentality, where fiction vs. fiction, monomyth vs. monomyth, and humaity is not winning. Like Wuran vs. Torah vs. Bible fiction conflicts and love / compassion / world peace are trashed in favor of thousands of yers of one fiction story like the Bible trying to "win" over fiction story of the Wuran and authentic nonfiction is avoided. Fox News fiction vs. Reddit commenting fiction, everyone on different pages, all avoiding nonfiction same-page undersatnding. ... ... ...

Our fiction addiction to stoyrtelling from politicians and leaders and businessmen. We fall so much in love with the storytelling of fiction we don't love human people. The "1 John 4:20" problem - you can't "Love God" because that's a fiction character. Lovign REAL PEOPLE is a 2,000 year old identified problem in "1 John 4:20" Bible verse. Loving a story more than human persons.

Exactly. Same in religions. People are unaware that "I Love God" is wrong, as "1 John 4:20" says. They love only who they love and hate upon other religons wihtout even being educated on the problem with that. Science fiction fans of one film who feel compelled to hate upon fans of another science ficton film. Hate itself is toxic sludge that the whole world prizes.

"People go “Well, how could we not have a belief in God?” This seems to be most American’s attitude, even those who are not Catholics, Jewish, Christian, whatever; they just answer those damn surveys that you get in USA Today where 98% of them go “I believe in God”, which of course just irritates the hell out of me. I mean I grew up around Baptists that hated… they loved God, loved their fellow man, but they just hated folks. You know what I mean? They loved God, but they hated everybody they knew, I mean… you get a lot of that from the like the Jesse Helms crowd, I mean they just loved God, but they hate everybody else badly. Sort of irritating given then great religious traditions." - 1993, Texan Rick Roderick https://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/

CONTEXT_A The most popular top comment. Speaking the talking points of anti-science. Satire-washing serious and important topics. Instead of removing Trump and all getting on the same page how fiction leadership is a self-harm to all humanity world wide, people are showing that the mechanic of power is having Putin and Trump leaders to insult / mock / copycat ideas / copycat phrases / copycat values. People are attracted to Trump for the sake of insulting and mocking science. It isn't ironic, it is poisoning the mass mind / mass man. We are using free time and spare time to learn and educate and teach anti-learning. The Elon Musk "mind virus" term... of anti-science about real virus. Our current attraction to anti-science, via mocking and total mokcery (Trump) is filling our minds with trash low-effort memes. We are "Amsuing Ourselves To Death" (Neil Postman 1985 book), "Satire ourselves to death", "maleducating ourselves to death" without self-awareness of the forest for trees - how it all aggregates into a mob mentalty of Putin and Trumpism. This is the outcomes of Surkov Governing, this is what Surkov Governing for 25 years is leading too... the embrace of "death by LOL", "Death by Satire", an anbandonment of comprehjension / understanding in favor of memroizing and programming the latest "talking points" (Charlie Kirk) and memrized memes / memorized phrases to bond over - and almost all those memorized memes are junk information / anti-learning /anti-goodness. Exactly what Donald Trump speaks in / signals as leadership. We are chasing anti-understanding signals like sheep. ... ... ...
“In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplaced, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

No, it won't, because tiny-short messages on Bluesky and Reddit and other platforms will satire-wash it away, normalize it by joke-washing it like white-washing. By making it entertainment engagement, fiction allows anything, in fiction stories there is a man named Andor on a planet far far away, and there are all kinds of things tolerable to people in fiction. That's the problem, Trump and Putin have mastred having people view the world as fiction trough media systems and butressing of media ecology. We are in a simulacra of consuming trash information and messages. People are only concenred with fiction vs. fiction while nonfiction is being abandoned. Goodness is being abadoned. Chasing humor-washing and joke-washing of real problems with not understanding how medical systems and airport-spread diseases work.
