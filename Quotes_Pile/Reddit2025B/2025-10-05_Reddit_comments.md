"More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

"That is the meaning of love. In the final analysis, love is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual.

"The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, **everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose**. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; **when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed**. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God.

Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human." You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it.

“In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, **fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Mockery-wshing RFK Jr's attack on autistic people. Satire-washing for entertainment. Millions of disposable low-effort comment addictions to turning everyything to do with Trump White House into content enagement / entertainment. Zero self-awareness that this is exactly how Russian Surkov governing exploits populations. ... ... ...
"Surkov turned Russian politics into a bewildering, constantly changing piece of theater. He sponsored all kinds of groups, from neo-Nazi skinheads to liberal human rights groups. He even backed parties that were opposed to President Putin. But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable." - [BBC, Adam Curtis](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), **year 2014**

People on social meme systems already worship sprots stars who have teams of doctors (reminder: I worked on private staff as an analysist / consultant for a NBA teamp owner / NFL team owner and had access to owner information systems). Trunp could brand it, "Trump Weight Loss" package of traedemarks. Just last week, Pentagon already called out obesesity in the public press, the media foundation is already laid. War Against Obesity. Donald Trump devoting all his time to live-streaming his exercise golf outings, weight loss, celebrity endorsements of fitness. Reddit is so shallow and superficial with hate about Trump fat jokes (and avoidiant of learning Russia information warfare based on total mockery). Hell, Trump coudl have his own Tony Clifton fat suit and take it off for reveals. And blame all his problems on obesity and glutton desires and not take any responsibility for letting Russia into the USA with mind-fucking in his November 7, 2012 agreement on Twitter.

Even with this dressed up in fiction and playing a character, it isn't entertaining enough for people to cite and reference in October 2025: "We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And **the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone**. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. **Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind**. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

People in the Reddit audience don't get it. People have abandoned nonfiction! Addiction to mocking reality has taken hold, mocking Trump, mocking aind insutling Trump as stupid. Nonfiction is in the toilet. Trump is WRITING the future, he is REWRITING reality and altering minds. As he has been doing since the November 7, 2012 agreement to create the IRA. This isn't about who was conservative or liberal yesterday before this speech, it is about follow-up to the Alaska meeting, and last week's Pentagon bigwigs meeting. He is actively going around altering the minds and feeding content to the Reddit audience. People are not learning nonfiction about how Russian information warfare works. ... ... ...
"This fusion of despotism and postmodernism, in **which no truth is certain**, is reflected in the craze among the Russian elite for neuro-linguistic programming and Eriksonian hypnosis: types of subliminal manipulation based largely on confusing your opponent, first developed in the US in the 1960s. There are countless NLP and Eriksonian training centres in Moscow, with every wannabe power-wielder shelling out thousands of dollars to learn how to be the next master manipulator. Newly translated postmodernist texts give philosophical weight to the Surkovian power model. François Lyotard, the French theoretician of postmodernism, began to be translated in Russia only towards the end of the 1990s, at exactly the time Surkov joined the government. The author of Almost Zero loves to invoke such Lyotardian concepts as the breakdown of grand cultural narratives and the fragmentation of truth" - 20 October 2011 https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

“The point is that television does not reveal who the best man is. In fact, television makes impossible the determination of who is better than whom, if we mean by 'better' such things as more capable in negotiation, more imaginative in executive skill, more knowledgeable about international affairs, more understanding of the interrelations of economic systems, and so on. The reason has, almost entirely, to do with 'image.' But not because politicians are preoccupied with presenting themselves in the best possible light. After all, who isn't? It is a rare and deeply disturbed person who does not wish to project a favorable image. But television gives image a bad name. For on television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience. And therein lies one of the most powerful influences of the television commercial on political discourse.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985

The sacred is now not secular, of this world of mere dead dust, but canonical, supernaturally revealed and authoritatively preserved; that is to say: God, from “out there,” has condescended graciously to accord special revelations: (1) to the Hebrews, historically, on Sinai, via Moses; (2) to mankind, historically, via Jesus; but then also, apparently, (3) to mankind, once again, historically, in a cave near Mecca, via Mohammad.

Someone remembers Cambridge Analytica, but wish people dicussed self-harm mob mentality as an evidende side-effect. People haven't come to terms with Comprative Mythology and The 1954 Equation. February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

The abscence of social media halting entertainment and call for people to focus on reality and nonfiction learning is the most alarming. I can only really keep an eye on Bluesky / YouTube / Reddit, I can no longer keep up with Facebook / Instagram / TikTok / Threads / Twitch / others. I hope if there was a Malala like "call to goodness" from white people to return to nonfictoin education. IMPORTANT_A if anyone ever reads what I say here, they may get the impression I hate relgion. Not at all! I think the Quran / Torah / Bible have a lot to teach. Inspiring science fiction and history of fandom of science fiction. It is the failure to adopt MLK Jr's reformations and Malala's reformation of the Levant science fiction triollogy that I criticize since 1948. James Joyce's monomyth gumbo, Finnegans Wake. People will not accept that the metaphors translate from old Torah monomyth patterns to new The Matrix 1999 patterns, or Star Wars 1977 patterns. Inspiring science fiction storytelling. Ultimatly, Malala seems better at pointing to goodness AND getting published for it than clergy that is still locked in out-group hate as Campbell described in 1987 Power of Myth published 1988. Including hate of Earth. ... ... ...
"Now, the biblical tradition is a socially oriented mythology. Nature is condemned. In the nineteenth century, scholars thought of mythology and ritual as an attempt to control nature. But that is magic, not mythology or religion. Nature religions are not attempts to control nature but to help you put yourself in accord with it. But when nature is thought of as evil, you don’t put yourself in accord with it, you control it, or try to, and hence the tension, the anxiety, the cutting down of forests, the annihilation of native people. And the accent here separates us from nature." - age 83, Joseph Campbell, 1987

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

BILL MOYERS: So perhaps the hero lurks in each one of us when we don’t know it? JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Our life evokes our character. You find out more about yourself as you go on. That’s why it’s good to be able to put yourself in situations that will evoke your higher nature rather than your lower. “Lead us not into temptation.” Ortega y Gasset talks about the environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a **mechanistic interpretation of the world came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive** to the hero. The hero is today running up against **a hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need**. MOYERS: A windmill. CAMPBELL: Yes, but Quixote saved the adventure for himself by inventing a magician who had just transformed the giants he had gone forth to encounter into windmills. You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not a mechanistic world in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and behavioristic psychology, that we’re nothing but a predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli. This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life. MOYERS: In the political sense ...

"What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

They insult all the time, insult back. The Taliban in Swat Valley pakistan terrorizes and attacks children all the time, terrorize and attack children back! That sure teaches the Taliban Quran conservatives and the USA Bible conservatives how to read thier book! More hate lessons and bad parenting from a toxic society that's the faith. Always more hate, always more violence, just keep building more technology of weapon systems.

God, this left vs. right brainrot mindsets. "mockery does not bother the left". So going to Wikipedia and putting in a bunch of mock information, turning facts and reality into a mockery, doesn't bother anyone. Having all the road signs point in the wrong direction doesn't bother "the left". This Twitter-think tweet-length short-message logic responses that everything anti-right makes sense... Donald Trump has turned the entire UNITED STATES OF AMERICA into mocking and mockery on the word stage, mocked people in Canada, are they a right-wing nation who isn't bothered that **manic mockery** has taken over the nation? That Surkov Putin information warfare since Q2 2013 has turned the USA into a bunch of meme addicts who can't stop flocking to mockery messages of Truth Social and the White House? Some magical "the left" can deal with measles being spread because of the mocking of science and how how the CDC is now a total mockery?

Putin hasn't accepted that weapon systems won't change the behaivor of Ukraine people. Bullets and shots to the head do in fact change behaviors, a dead person doesn't behave the same as alive. Killing outsiders and forcing them into prison and deporting people to a place they have no jobs or friends does indeed change their behavior. What ignorance on Reddit.

Self-dehumanizing.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. year 2019

People who hvave never net Greta in person are angry from information content, images and words, and Reddit audiencence loves that anger drives hate-filled men who are wrecking the world because of the mere existance of images and words on media systems.  People who love that power is handed over an concentrated in men on the basis of their anger at a young woman. Comparative Mythology releveals religion stories are not factually true, and power-concentrating men wreck thelive of women because of media content they concern. This has been going on for thousands of years. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): BILL MOYERS: And what do they say to you about women? JOSEPH CAMPBELL: They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy. Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity. But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, **they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults**. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and **our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking**.

Anger-based leadership, hate as faith. ... ... ... 
"What Cambridge Analytica observed was that when respondents were **angry**, their *need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced*. In particular, **anger put people** in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the **Plot to Break** America, page 128, **year 2019**

An entertainer was elected and using stock footage of South America riots is normal in fiction content creation. People meme and joke that politicains are liars, Trump and Putin take it to a level that people can't imagine. Because people don't want to face up that religions control MULTIPLE NATIONS, and this is the "old world order" as defined by the Grreat Seal. People are so ignorant about media ecology that they think the Internet invented the idea of fiction storytelling trolling, when Matthew 4:19 Bible verse clearly articulates using fiction magical stories to build an audience for a media veneue (Temple, Church).  THOUSANDS of years ago, Matthew 4:19 defines media based storytelling trolling. Social media did not invent trolling, what social media does is prize short-tiny shallow commenting that does not recognize what is going on.

What has happaned is nonfiction has been avandooned in favor of fiction storytelling, low-effort high volume commenting consumption on meme amusement mills.
