“The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity...  No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.”  

Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945

“All these pathological features — complete lack of insight into one’s own character, auto-erotic self-admiration, denigration and terrorization of one’s fellow man (how contemptuously Hitler spoke of his own people!), projection of the shadow, lying, falsification of reality, determination to impress by fair means or foul, bluffing and double-crossing — all these were united in the man who was diagnosed clinically as an hysteric, and whom a strange fate chose to be the political, moral, and religious spokesman of Germany for twelve years. Is this pure chance?”

“These personal observations led me to conclude at the time (1937), when the final catastrophe came, it would be far greater and bloodier than I had previously supposed. For this theatrical and transparent impostor was not strutting about on a small stage but was riding the armored divisions of the Wehrmacht, with all the weight of the German heavy industry behind him.”

# Science translation

"Why is psychology the youngest of the empirical sciences? (Year 1934) Why have we not long since discovered the unconscious and raised up its treasure-house of eternal images? Simply because we had a religious formula for everything psychic — and one that is far more beautiful and comprehensive than immediate experience. Though the **Christian view of the world has paled** for many people, the symbolic treasure-rooms of the East are still full of marvels that can nourish for a long time to come the passion for show and new clothes. What is more, these images — be they Christian or Buddhist or what you will — are lovely, mysterious, richly intuitive." - Dr. Carl G. Jung. The Archetypes and the **Collective Unconscious**, **year 1934**, page 7
