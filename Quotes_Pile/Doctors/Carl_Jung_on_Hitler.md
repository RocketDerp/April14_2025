# Dr. Carl Jung on Hitler

January 1939... "There is no question but that Hitler belongs in the category of the **truly mystic** medicine man. As somebody commented about him at the last NÃ¼rnberg party congress, since the time of Mohammed nothing like it has been seen in this world. **His body does not suggest strength**. The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer. This markedly mystic characteristic of Hitler's is what **makes him do things which seem to us illogical, inexplicable, and unreasonable**. ... So you see, Hitler is a medicine man, a spiritual vessel, a demi-deity or, even better, a myth." - interview with H. R. Knickerbocker, first published in Hearst's International Cosmopolitan (January 1939), in which Dr. Carl Jung was asked to diagnose Adolf Hitler

"We do not know whether Hitler is going to found a new Islam. (He is already on the way; he is like Mohammed. The emotion in Germany is Islamic; warlike and Islamic. They are all drunk with a wild god.)" - Dr. Carl Jung
