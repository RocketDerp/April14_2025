"That’s the problem; MAGA lives in a completely different reality from what is actually going on. They don’t have the mental capacity to apply critical thinking skills, they just ride on hatred and lies."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  On 9/11/2001 Quran fiction media content readers (Islamic Quran terrorists from Saudi Arabia) who live in the alternate reality of their fiction poetry storytelling, attacked USA. Reddit users in September 2025 can't discuss the Russian war against reality despite constantly observing that reality itself is in crisis. September 9, 2014 - more than ELEVEN FULL YEARS AGO: "The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

"I could dive straight down into the fiery ashes of hell and bring Kirk back myself, and MAGA would still shit on the left.

There is no world in which the Right wasn't going to villify the Left over this.

Almost like it was intended to be so?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : By saying Kirk is in (fiction) Hell, this reddit comment message vilifies "the right" with Satan / Devil fiction. Everything is right vs. left, left vs. right, and all the 5,000 patterns of media alternate reality games that Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency deployed since March 2013. Russia won the infromationo war, Surkov won. "**Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета".

"it doesn't matter. They're all at risk. They're desperately trying to make it look like left vs right because they don't want to hear the truth: every person they run into could potentially shoot them, because all these politicians have been screwing us over for decades. The country is armed to the teeth and the hatred for the government gets stronger every day."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Machine weapons vs. human beings. Egomania vs. love and compassion messages. Donald Trump is a messege system creator of hate and mass dehumanization. Those who mock and hate Trump are not resisting the hate and mockery. ===:::

"I feel like we are in an era of intellectual reductionism. Being reduced to a singular state-approved POV."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  We are in an era of Russian information warfare since March 2013 with zero self-awareness of media ecology, filter bubble, Cambridge Analytica psycological mechanics, etc. Trumpism and MAGA is an abandonment of nonfiction, giving up on science, and returning to mythological (fiction) based governing. ===:::

"Someone said it on here earlier…

“Fuck your feelings” is soooo much easier to give than to receive. And for a man they clearly worshipped who hated empathy they sure expect a boatload of it now. The idea behind “being better” is to learn from stuff like this and not doubling down on the hate filled ideas and rhetoric. It is early but what are his followers doing? Calling for war? Hating anyone on the left? Calling this the Reichstag Fire moment - which is confusing because that would mean they agree it was an inside job, right?

Personally, I’m struggling to feel anything other than indifferent. He died doing what he loved - being hateful and divisive - so shouldn’t we all be so lucky? Instead of, I don’t know, dying in a mass shooting or because of some disease we eradicated decades ago they are determined to revive through ending vaccinations?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts of Reddit / Bluesky / Twitter / Facebook, addicted to Russian fiction and hate messaging, will die doing what they love: worshiping touchscreen media devices of fiction and abandoning climate change, science reality, medical science in favor of mocking figureheads like RFK Jr / Trump over and over. This has gone on for OVER TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, endless nonstop mocking the Donald Trump performance of Tony Clifton antics. Surkov won, Russia won the meme war to make Americans addicted to natics and fiction, avoidant of nonfiction. ===:::

"Yep, Trump tweeted a meme about loving the smell of deportations in the morning but I’m the one who supposed to cry tears over Charlie Kirk’s death? Fuck that"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Short-message Twitter-thinking Tweet-logic polarity. Two sides and only two sides, "both sides", even when both are wrong - just compare siplistic options and don't recogonize the Russian information warfare and how Donald Trump is "tweeted a meme" is Surkovian governing / Kremlin antics absurd surreal politics. Avoiding nonfiction learning, just engaging the Twitter-framing of society, a crude short-message interpretaiton, fiction-framed simualcra. Recency bias abounds, people on Reddit meme machine sites can't see beyond Twitter meme machiene sites to what USA society was like in year 2012 before the IRA media invaison of Reddit / Twitter / Facebook / etc since March 2013. Sucked into the media addictions of media fiction vs media fiction (Reddit vs. Twitter). Nonfiction of media ecology avoided: 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" - https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/ ===:::

"Your biggest clue, is trump commented about all this almost immediately and continued to fuel the flames of hate for the rest of the day."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length tweet short message thiking. Biggist clue of *runaway fiction addiction* is that media addicts on Reddit are glued to a 79 year old Donald Trump media addict who created his own social media platform out of addiction to fiction leadership. The 1985 book by Neil Postman titled "Amuisng Ourselves To Death" explains the media ecology of Donald Trumpism / media addiction behavior problems on a national scale. ===:::

"I really hate how this is just as reasonable an explanation as anything else (if not moreso), and it just really feels like the truth will not come out because this is indeed super accurate.

And I really hate the cowards with nefarious intent that will use this to fan additional violence (either from the public or authoritarian crackdown).

The USA died months ago, just waiting for reality to catch up."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I will point out the elephants in the room being avoided in September 2025. Information warfare attacks on Canada as forced "51st state", information warfare attacks on Greenland. Avoidance of defending Ukraine and meeting with Putin in Alaska and a pro-Kremlin stance and messaging. Avoidance of ever mentioning the "Internet Research Agency" and avoidance of mentioning Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News audience branwashing (nonfiction film). Avoidance of declaring we have runaway media addiction problems and that Donald Trump and many around him seem entirely addicted to paterns of Kremlin information. Instead, a constant sustained focus on magical private jet sex acts / "Epstein" / Pizzagate / QAnon level fiction. Instead of claling for science-based comprehension and understanding of reality, people are calling for a magical wildcard "list" of Epstein... which will just lead to more and more calling for more and more rich white men sex lives information. Meanwhile, women being given a voice like Malala's efforts globaly (not just domestic USA) are ignored and avoided. Girls are not empired, but nonstop focus on magical sex acts of rich old white elder rules (just like the Taliban in Swat Valley, Pakistain dicating to little girls like Malala and nobody wanting to hear the girls voices on the subject of sexaul domination by male elders). How does one describe that Pizzagate style addiciton to white men sex lives is driving the entire Epstein stopic engagement? While Canada is being attacked in anti-NATO pro-Russia fashion in 2025? ====:::

"i have my own opinions on this. but i will say, trump did say that voting to release the epstein files would be seen as an act of war. how close to the timing of the vote was charlie kirk killed?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Context reminder... a 3-day holiday weekend at the start of the month was full of social media messaging that Donald Trump had died and that the fiction "Weekend at Bernies" movie was running the White House. https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-photographed-labor-day-amid-baseless-death-rumors-2122752 Now less than 24 hours after a killing of Charlie Kirk, social media society is engaged in wild magical epstein stories. ===:::

What I dont understand is how many of us delude ourselves into thinking we have any power or say in what comes next. Except to take the law into our own hands of course. At least nobody has found a better idea yet."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : a subtle pro-violence message, "law into our own hands". Not resisting a Russian psychological war with educaiton and nonfiction teaching. Not even self-aware that Russia won a information war since March 2013. Complete ignorance and pro-violence against Americans. American on American violence. Exaclty what Russia IRA condtioned society for since year 2013. ===:::

Donald Trump provides a constant concentration of hate and mocking. People can not resist the mocking and hate of Trump playing Tony Clifton antics. Russian Surkov techniques of governing. ===:::

"This is always an interesting quote when you consider violence has been the go-to solution for humanity throughout history."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-think Tweet-length thinking patterns. Pondering... That death from diseases an large families due to childbirth is history and traidition of humanity, so medical advances and learning advances of humans aren't important. There is no progress other tahn weapon systems technology advancements valued by technology lovers. Violence s the go-to solution for domestic marriage, family anilihation and family murder/suicide. Honor killings of women in Islamic cultures. Tradition sure sells a nightmare of history (James Joyce). "violence has been the go-to solution", weighs realy heavy on the meaning of the word *solution*. It solves boredom to media addict society that want more action politics and violence breaking news events. ====:::

The person has to edit their message (as depicted) to make it known to others this happened. Most people don't speak up about these kind of tactics.

"It's how you differentiate the left from leftists. Leftists will very publicly state they no longer care about 'taking the high road', they see it as fighting fire with fire by doing exactly what they accuse the right of doing.

There are 3 options in these situations. Celebrate, condemn, or just remain quiet. More people just need to take the 3rd option, unfortunately narcissism prevents them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Can not possibly be any answers outside these 3. Such as educating and teaching about Russian informatio warfare, which is not one of the three listed. Humanity driven by ignorance. "the left" vs "the leftists" crap, without detailed specific lists of values. "the hgh road" also a wildcard. I don't see people supporting Malala's education movement since she published her book in October 2013. What "high road" are people taking towards world peace and right-wing Taliban?  What most Reddit meme addicts mean by "high road" isn't anything close to education / teachg / comprehension / understanding of human mob mentality and information warfare problems / how billionares manipulate audiences. A "high raod" would be using Reddit to promtoe every single day, every 12 hours for years, Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News and hate-based right-wing media. I dn't see anyone using social media to promote that "high road", but I see social media fiction content addicts promoting action media content of shootings captured on video.  People who want more action, entertainment, hyper reality out of their society and prize Donald Trump's antics and nonsense to constantly mock and insult on media machines. The idea of a health intellectually organized and peacefu society is treated as boring and undesirable. Nonficiton is avoided in favor of promoting celebration of ignroance and celebration of violence (like the Middle East celebrates violence over other humans) ===:::

"I'm strongly of the belief circa 2015 the entire world just forget narcissists exist. So many people just refuse to accept people do or say things solely to get attention rather than actually believing it."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit comment is describing fiction. People who create a fiction show like Star Wars Andor "solely to get attention" (artists creating content for an audience, for profit, wealth, attention, social power, mindshare power). But don't actually believe that a galaxy far far away is Star Wars is real factual history / reality. Donald Trump creates fiction, Putin creates fiction. Fiction is the whole basis of the Russian information warfare. This Reddit comment is describing that in year 2015 people lost their ability to distinguish fiction from nonfiction (or were induced to be attracted deeply to self-harm fiction). Aritsts and video game creators and film makers / TV show creators constantly are creating fiction messages they don't believe in. Many are even paid to do so for major corporations or goverments, such as [paid employees of Russia's Internet Research Agency since year 2013 to create comments on Reddit and other Internet media systems](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643) https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 .
Donald Trump "Truth Social" is ficiton, despite the name. And do you see audiences pointing out the war against reality / war against nonfiction? Linking this story from September 9, 2014: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - right before this comment's time period?
