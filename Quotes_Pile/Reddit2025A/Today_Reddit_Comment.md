"Presumably left and right are domestic and Islamic is foreign?

No wait cause foreign nationalism would cover that yea?

Either way American conservatives and Islams are pretty distinct"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Human brain isn't distinct. You take a 1 day old child born in Pakistan ad a Muslim and transport them to Texas and raise them in a Christian English-speaking framily, we can witness this. You aren't *born* with the Quran and a spoken language in your head, it is learned / aquired. Left vs. right reeks of longstanding brainrot. People in USA importing this French idea of where religion (fiction) believers sit compared to a king. Obidence to a God-ordained bloodline King. The Founding Fathers created the Great Seal to define directions: old world oder (front and back) vs. new world order, vertical climbing of 13 steps of thinking. But you will not find social media users discuss the Founding Fathers ideals and parrot this left vs. right. Islam is FICTION-concered. Mohammad's Quran story is a retcon science fiction story of The Bible. This isn't just me trying to be shockking and offensive. Seperation of science thinking from "sounds good" fiction is not a minor conflict in USA 2025! Arguing over favorite scinece fiction stories, Star Trek vs. Star Wars, and parenting with said storytelling creates a bias people will not wake up to. Finnegans Wake / Media Ecology wake *topic*. The Founding Fathers coudl have put Jesus into the Constitutiton or Great Seal, they did not. And this is not a minor topic of *why*. To deny the common heritage of Islam and Christianity is a major mistake. And we can't let street-gang violence of science fiction fans attacking science fiction fans be like football holligans attacking over a sports game fanaticism. We have to *sober up* from the wild and out of control media content addictions, be it Fox News, Reddit memes, Star Wars, or Quran / Torah / Bible! Faith in an afterlife without evidence can lead to horrible outcomes like Nazi Germany extermination of Jewish / Torah fanatics by Bible / Christian fanatics! The Founding Fathers *did know* of the Muslim vs. Christian Cruisades run by The People, the *old world order* perspective of the Great Seal. ===:::

"I don't agree. The elephant in the room (9/11) was Osama's surprisingly successful plan, and Osama said quite plainly that he did it because of US troops on holy land, and US support of Israel.

That is, nationalism.

And in a sense, Osama got some of what he wanted. Most of the hijackers were Saudis, and now Saudi Arabia has armed itself (with US weapons) so it can take care of business without US help. Osama also got a war in Iraq, and a war in Afghanistan. In Iraq a Sunni dictator was deposed, and a Shia government took over. That's not exactly what Osama would have wanted, but it's a step in the right direction. And Afghanistan is EXACTLY what he wanted it to be.

You can't fight a religion. You can only fight against states or their terrorist representatives, and some states are motivated by religion so you'll have to occupy them for generations before their religious fervor is gone.

If we'd only known this before. But we (and I include Australia) were fighting mad."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Religions based on science fiction, cults based on science ficiton have to not take over. A suicide cult that believes in heaven after death, with no evience, is a know exploit of the human mind / brain and needs to be treated this way. Weapon systems are too powerful. Democracy can not work if people don't actually desire to love one another / comapssion for one another. Racial based conquest and hate are toxic to the world. ===:::

"Calling out “tyranny” so directly shows how seriously he views the threat Russia poses, and how important support for Ukraine has become across Europe’s leadership. It's also notable that he said during a state dinner with Trump who was more skeptical about long-term support. It sends a clear message about where the UK stands, regardless of political shifts. Symbolically, it reinforces that defending Ukraine is seen as defending European stability as a whole"

Trump creates a manufactured problem. He has done this so many times in the past. Then he finds a solution, and he blames the problem on biden or Obama. Then conservatives just pretend that it was biden who actually caused the problem not Trump, and Trump fixed it easily."

There is so much amusement-washing LOL-washing humor-washing on social meme sites that people are constantly having their minds reset to forget... exctly what Russian Surkovian governing techniques do to a population. Constantly stimulating We The People with absurd surreal brain exploits. No defense has been found, Russia has been controlled using these techniques for 25 years under Putin. Constant normalization of terrible and bad outcomes, such as death of Russians to Ukraine war - serving no goodness. ===:::

"And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where **even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives**, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, **a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies** is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds.

"Given the entire right wing was blaming trans people before Kirk's body even got to the hospital, it's clear they were primed for something.

And given since then it's been this endless drumbeat of trying to make it trans people's fault somehow? All like what, a week after Trump floated banning trans people from owning guns?

If you're looking at less than 1% of the population and instantly blaming them for everything, and you're also talking about disarming just them -- the shit you have planned for that group starts as "atrocity" and ends in "mass extermination".

People rarely shoot at cops or feds because it's a very effective way of getting yourself killed. "We better take their guns first" means the odds of living are even worse if you don't shoot back."

"I am so fucking tired, so unbelievably tired, of coming onto Reddit and other places and each thread is the same snarky comments pointing out hypocrisy. "What about this...", "Wait, I thought...." and all that shit. I get it, what else can you do, but it's like hypocrisy gives them boners and you'll never inform them enough to change.

Sometimes, it feels like I'm waiting for the rest of the world to catch up. Accept, they lie and they don't use words like normal people do.

"it's a surprisingly consistent take when you presume that they want to legally codify fertilized eggs as having the full set of human rights that an actual born person does. and because IVF itself is not exactly an easy or for sure process, you end up with extra fertilized eggs that end up going to waste, which if you follow their logic means you've just murdered a bunch of babies.

even still, I'm honestly surprised they're taking this route to its logical conclusion since IVF has given so many people a chance to have babies when they otherwise would simply not be able to, and that in and of itself is such a nonpartisan act that everyone could seemingly get behind it. I like think they will get a lot more push back from the conservative rabble who would otherwise be vehemently against abortion since by its very nature the entire idea is to make more babies... but then again betting that conservative voters will act in their own best interest has never been a smart play."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Long-form comments are often great for complex topics, Reddit vs. Bluesky tiny-length, but typical of 2025 is there is no author name drop, no book or citation mentioned. Just off-the-cuff anonymous commentary that reddit craves and desires so it can forget it minutes later changing topics to entertainment / fiction. There is no dsire on Reddit society to assert the same nonfiction common ground of reality itself, instead video game (Reddit screen game) addiction to fiction. Like Pac-Man eating tiny little comment dots for food, screen after screen of words taht are never weighted to be more improtant beyond popularity itself (upvoting). People do not say: WE ALL NEED TO STOP STREAMING NEW MESSAGES AND FOCUS ON COMMON MESSAGE, ONE WELL-EXPRESSED IDEA, LIKE HOW THE FOUNDING FATHERS GOT TOGETHER July 4, 1776 TO PUBLISH A COMMON AGREEMENT OF A MANIFESTO!

The highest priority of republicans is to own the libs. All the other ones are lower priority for the republican base and they counter the interest of the republican donors and Trump.

Edit: to the comment about it seeming I see this as having come from nowhere I can't see any longer: I'm fully aware this didn't come out of nowhere, but it's the gloves off approach to it particularly in the last year. I would say the brazen cheek of it perhaps. There is a swift acceleration here vs the last 50 years I mean, the foundation has crumbled and its taking little effort to knock down the walls."

It will take time to find out the full truth, but hardly anyone in our society actually cares about truth any more. Which is frightening, because what remains is indistinguishable from madness. Trumpian madness at that, basically choosing/constructing your own personal “reality” with no regard to actual reality.

"Because Christianity is centered on martyrdom. The messiah was a martyr, so the church essentially deifies the practice. But you can't have a martyr without persecution, which is why so many Christians see persecution everywhere— they're told that non-Christians hate them and are being used by Satan to lure them away from their faith. Martyrdom is basically the top level achievement and offers the perfect opportunity to say "See? They all hate us! We must save this country from their evilness."
