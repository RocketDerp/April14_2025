"It's going to flip flop around idiotic figures in a downward spiral that leads to idiotism paralyzing any meaningful political progress in your country. Every new administration will have to remove everything from that before."

"Why lie about every issue? Being in favor of crime is demented, letâ€™s see how that ages."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-think Bluesky-length thinking. Politicians who are dishonest and manipulate We The People is a crime. "Demented" plauing on "Dementia Donnie" topic. "like about every issue", constant deception claim. Perfect 100% falsehoods is impossible, nobody can be perfect correct or perfectl false. What one can be is perfectly banal. Short tiny comment messages that manipulate the mind into perfection of always bieng shallow and superficial. But you can't always be correct 100% or always be wrong 100%. ===:::

"I am constantly surprised that so many of my fellow Americans so admire a blow-hard bully who constantly whines about everything and seems to be so thin skinned that he flips out about any questioning of his motives or pointing out the ignorant cluelessness of so many of his actions."

"No. He has a 38% approval rating. 60% disapproval."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : When dealing with Tony Clifton performances, you add these two numbers together. Total engagement is what matters. 38% + 60% = 98%. People booing and mocking Tony Clifton are still glued to the show. This has been going on FOR OVER TEN FUCKING YEARS.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts crave and message "right answer" to have more OnlyFans and suffering of Americans. Americans hate Americans. People believe that suffering is goodness. Entirely brainwashed by Russian IRA meme warfare since March 2013 to self-harm the USA using social machine messaging systems. ===:::

"To me one of the most chilling parts of 1984, and one that to me explains a lot of the conservative/authoritarian mindset, is when O'Brien explains to Smith that making someone else suffer is the only way to make sure you have power over them: after all, how can you know you are imposing your will on someone else if they just comply? For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them. That is the point of cruelty for its own sake as weaponized by conservatives ans authoritarians."

"
> How is this not immediate grounds for impeachment?

The clown show will continue until such time as the audience demands their money back."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : USA people are spending all their spare time and free time commenting and discussing the Tony Clifton performance. The addiction to the Clifton show and techniques is so extreme that even after 10 years people keep craving and calling for more. "Sleepy Joe Biden" was way too boring performance for meme addeled media addiction nation. ===:::
