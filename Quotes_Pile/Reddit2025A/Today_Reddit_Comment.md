"We Should Put Our Phones Down’: Utah Governor Says ‘There Is a Tremendous Amount of Disinformation’ About Charlie Kirk Assassination"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Better headline focus of our amusement-driven entertainment-driven USA society of 2025: Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Charlie Kirk was providing fiction storytelling at the university to a crowd of over 3,000. And now fiction on the Internet about the killing / murder outsells nonfiction. ===:::

"There is a trememdous amount of disinformation, period. Kinda hard to put the genie back in the bottle for specific instances only."

"Don't forget about pure incompetence as well. They hate anyone that actually knows what they are talking about."

Get out of here.” It’s like somebody who would start running back and forth while other people try and play a tennis game running back and forth on the tennis court, busting up the game. There is nothing nuttier than playing tennis, but it’s great fun and you believe it’s worth winning"](../Specific/Campbell_Tennis.md) ===:::

"Specifically on Reddit, it's gotten worse since it became a publicly traded company and the API changes. Though I understand it's been deteriorating even before that."

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

"The *news* sounds crazy to me anymore, so I don't mind indulging myself in the occasional conspiracy theory.

Don't forget gun rights advocates pushing back on Trump wanting to restrict second amendment rights for trans people and this guy conveniently having trans carved into his shell casings..."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  So, this Reddit comment is messaging... that if Truth Social *news* sounds crazy, we should all adopt the popularity of crazy and *add more crazy content* to media systems! This behavior is the foundation of Russian information warfare, that once you seed anti-reality (crazy / surreal / absurd) into media environments, people will adopt the nonsense and add more out of compusive behavior. Surkov won, Russia won, since March 2013. ===:::
