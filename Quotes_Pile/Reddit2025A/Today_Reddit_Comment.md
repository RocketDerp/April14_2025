"HIs is the classis dilemma of the liar. Trump lies so much he has no credibility at all. There is no transparency. The American people really have no information on the president's health. So what do the republicans do? They investigate Biden from a year ago. And so it goes."

"There is no proof that he is fine. If they want to make this all go away then have Trump do a press conference. Anyone can be using his social media account and I have yet to see a photo that's not questionable about its authenticity."

"I moved to Texas 2 years ago and joined Nextdoor. I immediately notice that every video posted of every level of regular neighborhood happenings is met with comments like “they’re lucky I wasn’t there with my gun” “wish they would have tried that at my house, I’m ready with a gun”. None of the videos/images showed people breaking into a house, btw.

Just a collection of people dying to use their guns because they lived in a very safe, low crime suburb which didn’t fit their Rambo fantasies. That’s how this nonsense happens."

"Fox News primes them to believe this. They are genuinely enemies of the country."

"Everyone is afraid of a hot WW3, and while it's right to avoid that, it's not right to allow Russia to attack the West through influence, propaganda, undersea cable cutting, GPS jamming, etc. without consequence, and purely financial responses aren't deterring them.

Eventually influence campaigns get the job done, seeding a societal cancer that eventually kills the host. We're seeing that today across Europe and in the US.

Russia only understands force."

"The real question is why we're not doing the same they are doing. Where are our attempts to unseat Putin? It's one thing to not want to escalate, but Russia set the rules of the game. Why aren't we playing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People againt Putin are not self-aware that what Surkov information warfare does is make people addicted to entertainment-based politics. Fiction outselling nonfiction also takes on Saudi Arabia Mecca, Russia, Palestine, Israel, etc. Putin is convincing people that "War All Against All" (Surkov calls the 5th World War) is more social media engagement and excitement than compassionand love. This is a LONG standing problem of the Bible fiction storytelling in USA. Sports games, video games, addictions to competition to entertainment - not learning nonfiction self-improvement. Entertainment of war, entertainment of hate insulting mocking of out-groups is the values of Putin. And USA has discarded science and compassion values in favor of entertainment. "Fight fire with fire" means fight entertainment Putin and Trump with more entertainmet. It has wercked the Earth itself with climate change and religion entertainment wars. Trash mockery politics on Reddit outsells nonfiction sincere leaders. Rupert Murdoch's Fox News fiction outsells important science learning and comprehension. ===:::

"Same reason democrats always "plays nice".

Civilized people expect some kind of baseline of behaviour and civility, and if "we" break it, there is no one left to uphold it. I would agree at one point it has to stop, but I can kinda see it as well."

"Germany investigated the Nordstream pipeline bombing like it was the most important thing ever. When they requested information from polish law enforcement about some people involved, Poland was like "lol, nah". It's a fucking war, why are we investigating the side that does these things to defend themselves and weaken the aggressor? And to what end? Are we going to arrest the Ukrainians that did it? It has no consequence now that it's done and it was a convenient way for Germany to get out of the remaining contracts without being held responsible for rising energy prices resulting from it.

Germany isn't even able to weaken the propaganda of the AfD, let alone working on tools to counter Russian propaganda."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : AfD is selling the message that hate and mocking of outsiders has long-term payoffs. That love and compassion should be abandoned in favor of addiction to hate and mass dehumanization. Which is more popular in video games, war and killing entertainment. Real life, authentic nonfiction learning - what Malala is begging people to do... doesn't sell like AfD and Russia's hate content. Comprehension and understanding are boring to people who want enemy to mock and hate. ===:::

"As much as I agree with you, my country almost put a puppet president in charge because of the propaganda, the money, and all the finely tuned influence Russia put behind him. Our secret services were so behind they only managed to put the pieces together only AFTER the court cancelled the elections because of the tampering they uncovered. They pushed propaganda through tiktok just a few months before elections. The candidate participated in NO debates. Almost a year later, we see the people that voted for him around us. They are people living abroad, sending money home, that have voted for a crazy man that was about to close the boarders to Europe and basically strip us of any NATO protection. As much as you want to blame the common man, this psychological warfare is something hard to detect and combat."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : There is a society-wide crisis, aftermath, of people being shallow and superficial. People who proclaim Donald Trump is a liar and deceiver, but won't dicuss WHY would poeople believe lies and deceptionleadership is good for their children and future. People who proclaim Fox News has harmed their parents and siblings in their family, but won't discuss Jen Senko's year 2015 film. People who think TikTok convinces people to believe lies and falsehoods, but won't discuss Reddit. Tree after tree not willing to learn and study the forest level of multiple NATO nations. That's why I keep pushing for 1985 dead author Neil Postman for people to gain perspective on attraction to fiction problem. A dead author isn't speaking about Fox News which didn not come along until October 7, 1996. A book from eleven years earlier explains the problem before Fox News and Apple iPhone were created. We The People are taking comprehension, understanding, communications all *for granted*, and we have fed meme after meme, sports after sports, fiction video game after fiction video game, entertainment Fox News, over and over into our minds. Neil Postman's 1985 book explains this as best as can be done in a short 1984 page book. The addiction to clickbait and addiction to egoism filter-bubbles has taken over society. Putin and Trump understand how to feast upon an exploited mind-fucked popupaltion that favors fiction and avoids nonfiction. ===:::

"We (western democracies) are fighting back, but Putin has tighter control over the media than we do. In addition the amount of information needed to make change is much higher, because you aren't going to win elections with information campaigns. You'd have to influence the Russian public enough to revolt.

Finally, they are just better at it. I'm not aware of any western disinformation campaign as successful as Brexit or Trump.

We might be smarter to do things like stuxnet in Russia. That we have shown aptitude in."

"I live and teach in a rural area. I promise that most of these folks will never know the truth. They will continue to believe that Obama and Biden and the Clintons are behind all of this. They are sick, angry, and suspicious and when Fox News is on every television telling you that the democrats are to blame it takes zero effort to believe it.

It’s so difficult when I have first graders repeating things they hear their parents say. It was rough during the election. One of my students who receives several services (van transportation, reading support, speech therapy) was really excited that Trump was elected because he was “going to get rid of all the bad people in the country”. And she’s not the exception."

"Golfing while wearing a tan suit and eating a hamburger with Dijon mustard.

Aka the unholy Fox News Trinity.

Yep, the history channel was right. That guy was the antichrist of US presidents.

Look at all that economic, social and spiritual stability he tried to trick us with."
