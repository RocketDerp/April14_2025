"Frigging nazis getting bolder every day and instead of dealing with the issue leadership is fanning the flames. This will get worse before it gets better, nazis need to be shamed to hiding again."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Sunday morning on Reddit, church lessons, USA church technique of *shame them*. Attitudes of: It's perfectly OK to have hate mindsets in people, but I want to be able to block them on social machines so I don't have to hear their specific flavor / brand of hate. Nothing will ever go wrong that I have accepted hate in every day of my life, I just don't want this one Germany hate system to be able to speak or communicate. A filter-bubble of egoism that hate is perfectly fine in the world as long as it is my kind of anti-humanism hate. That's the Reddit messaging of machine lust / worship of technology Reddit machines, to block and silence out the Nazi messages but perfectly fine with Reddit hate of some other kind - as long as it isn't Germany organized hate groups from "over there". Hate of Fox News vs. Bluesky and Reddit vs. Facebook is welcome on Reddit, but not the Germany hate system of Nazi messages. Shallow and superficial egomania culture of worship hate, just particular which choices are made from the buffet of hate subreddits. "nazis need to be shamed to hiding again" - the only goal is that they are hidden from sight / hidden and underground, like secret Islamic terrorists, in hiding. The message is: set a very low low low measuring bar of progress and reform. Don't listen to Malala and address the problems. Don't listen to MLK Jr and address the problems as a global issue. Just focus on the ones you don't personally find attractive. Short tiny Twitter-think logic about Russian information warfare. Russia has been feeding Nazi symbols for decades, as documented by Howard Bloom in his August 14, 2000 book (before September 11, 2001.. before MAGA and Trump). Techniques now adapted to the Internet Research Agency online Russian export... ... ...
"On the other side of the religious divide stood the new Fundamentalists of Racial Purity and Christianity, whose leaders skillfully manipulated conformity enforcement mechanisms which impel us to pick on those who are different. Typical among these was a group called **Russian National Unity**, which claimed an army of 70,000, snapped up members at the age of nine, enrolled them in "military patriotic clubs," dressed them in fascist uniforms, gave them the insignia of the **swastika, taught them the Nazi** salute" - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. Chapter: The Kidnap of Mass Mind. Page: 201. Howard Bloom. Published: August 14, 2000

"It's actually well established, even by the FBI:

Russian influence enabled the extreme media coverage (making things seem worse, etc.) that is now being used by US media as it has been shown to work for ads, etc. so the Russian seeds have worked.

There was real evidence for influence in 2016:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials_and_spies

"The FBI's work was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who led a special counsel investigation until March 2019.[8] Mueller concluded that Russian interference was "sweeping and systematic" and "violated U.S. criminal law", and he indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations."

This one I haven't read, but if the citations are sound it's comprehensive:

https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/tree/main

Some very interesting info courtesty of u/Speffers98:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency - "...Russian company which was engaged in online propaganda and influence operations on behalf of Russian business and political interests"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear - "Russian cyber espionage group. American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has stated with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency"

https://nationalpost.com/news/world/a-russian-troll-farms-most-viewed-facebook-ad-wasnt-about-trump-it-promoted-u-s-law-enforcement - this is interesting. It's Russian troll farms pretending to fight each other online "left v right", etc.

https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html - same as above but with black rights.

This has only gotten worse and will continue to do so."

"This is what a lot of people don't realize. These countries (much like our own) have entire teams/programs dedicated to Psychological Operations. They study and have plenty of data on what is considered contentious subjects. Race, political affiliations all these things just waiting to be exploited. 

And those that fall into these false narritives about race and political identities becoming part of you own personal identity... You are playing right into the hands of foreign adversaries.

Furthermore, particularly on the political front... Politicians are not representing you - left or right - they are representing their own monetary interests. Do you know of a congressperson or someone who has been president thats not a multimillionaire? So tread with caution before you start fighting IRL or virtually online for any higher office people. Look at their actions, not their words and be smart. Don't fall into herd mentality. It's a trap no matter what side you are on.

Plenty of other more fruitful places to 'belong'."

"Europe has failed to realise fascism wasn't a fad of the nazis it's a human quality.

Oldest I can find of violent authritarianism through establishment of an underclass whose purpose is to be lesser and persecuted is ancient Sumeria who hated women. The Romans did it, the Catholic church did it, the British did it and the Nazis did it. This isn't new.

Yet we have sat here and allowed fascists to incite hatred and develop a platform despite the fact that these people are the most deadly issue humanity has ever faced bar literal disease.

This is a fundamental failure of democracy and is tantamount to institutional suicide. Fascists should be stripped of their media presences and their vote because 70% of the population shouldn't be persecuted and executed because 30% is hateful and insane.

Keir Starmer and populist panderers have fundamentally failed as human beings. These fascists will kill anyone who stands against them if it is "acceptable" and so we must prevent their interference at all costs. No rights beneath my rights."

"Look at history. There was a time before social security and retirement savings protections. It was very ugly. One indicator that you can track is life expectancy gets shorter.

Work till you physically can‚Äôt or no one wants you, then live off the kindness of whatever community you have, die of poor nutrition or inability to get medical care. Hope someone will help you die humanely‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing new, we just haven‚Äôt seen it in living memory."

"And as ugly as that was, at least it was normal and standard for multiple generations to live in the same home together. Kids took care of their parents when their parents couldn't take care of themselves anymore. That is no longer normal."
