"Depressing music has it's place. But for the love of all the Gods of music, please make it more. Make it angry and depressed (NIN), or make it esoteric and depressed (Tea Party), or make it arty and depressed (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds). Just a few examples off the top of my head. But milquetoast and depressive, where does that get fun?"

"This is maybe not the best example. The right decided that she’s also one of their martyrs (since she was a pretty white woman killed by a black guy in a Democrat city) and have been posting about her everywhere. Conservatives just raised over $2.5 million to install murals of Iryna Zarutska all over the US (with $1 million being donated by Elon Musk). They’ve highly politicized her death as well. Of course, it’s all performative because you know that 90% of them don’t give a shit about Ukrainian refugees or justice/mental health reform otherwise and, if Twitter posts are anything to go by, are just clamoring to say slurs because of the race angle."

"I think thats the one of the biggest kickers to me. I called a friend out for posting a sympathy post. She didn't directly reply back to me but instead writes a follow up comment on her own post which addresses my call out by going "i didn't post about the 2 democrats who were shot because I never post about anything like this"

And im just like...exactly! You never post political stuff yet took the time to defend THIS man? This man who would condemn you for having had an abortion as a teenager - which i didn't say but couldn't help thinking to myself.

Its such virtue signaling and an attempt at moral superiority and its really pathetic to watch. Like yall ain't my friends let alone an ally to me or my loved ones."

"Actually, A republican man shot and killed another republican man at a republican event in a republican state which has repeatedly voted against gun regulations and in fact put a law into place that allowed guns onto the college campus where the event happened.

And yes, somehow all that is Democrats fault because they are evil baby blood drinking Satan worshipers who want everyone except illegal immigrants dead, which is why we must kill them all.

Sadly they are also oblivious to reality, so rarely ever take action, and are usually inept when they do.

"Let me get this straight. People are upset because Kirk said a lot of dumb words which resulted in violence. They view it as an attack on free speech.

So when this man says some words they don’t like, the Kirk crowd resorts to… violence? Do these people really care about free speech or do they only advocate for it when it benefits them?"

"r/conservative is like the ultimate propaganda machine right now(more than normal). I know the leftist can get stuck in a circle jerk until the issues seem satirical, from time to time, but conservatives take this shit to another level. The projection going on over there. Those "facts" that don't give a fuck about our feelings aren't even in their favor on any of this, and the term "groyper" is nowhere to be found on that sub. I'm sure there's a fair number of Nick Fuentes followers over there.

They cannot wrap their heads around one of their own doing this, even though some conservative nut jobs have already done a few assassinations and attempted assassinations this year. I think they forgot about those cause they just used them to take cheap shots at the victims. They're even more delusional than they accuse the liberals of being."
