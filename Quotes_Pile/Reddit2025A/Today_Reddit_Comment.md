"HIs is the classis dilemma of the liar. Trump lies so much he has no credibility at all. There is no transparency. The American people really have no information on the president's health. So what do the republicans do? They investigate Biden from a year ago. And so it goes."

"I moved to Texas 2 years ago and joined Nextdoor. I immediately notice that every video posted of every level of regular neighborhood happenings is met with comments like “they’re lucky I wasn’t there with my gun” “wish they would have tried that at my house, I’m ready with a gun”. None of the videos/images showed people breaking into a house, btw.

Just a collection of people dying to use their guns because they lived in a very safe, low crime suburb which didn’t fit their Rambo fantasies. That’s how this nonsense happens."

"Everyone is afraid of a hot WW3, and while it's right to avoid that, it's not right to allow Russia to attack the West through influence, propaganda, undersea cable cutting, GPS jamming, etc. without consequence, and purely financial responses aren't deterring them.

Eventually influence campaigns get the job done, seeding a societal cancer that eventually kills the host. We're seeing that today across Europe and in the US.

Russia only understands force."

"The real question is why we're not doing the same they are doing. Where are our attempts to unseat Putin? It's one thing to not want to escalate, but Russia set the rules of the game. Why aren't we playing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People againt Putin are not self-aware that what Surkov information warfare does is make people addicted to entertainment-based politics. Fiction outselling nonfiction also takes on Saudi Arabia Mecca, Russia, Palestine, Israel, etc. Putin is convincing people that "War All Against All" (Surkov calls the 5th World War) is more social media engagement and excitement than compassionand love. This is a LONG standing problem of the Bible fiction storytelling in USA. Sports games, video games, addictions to competition to entertainment - not learning nonfiction self-improvement. Entertainment of war, entertainment of hate insulting mocking of out-groups is the values of Putin. And USA has discarded science and compassion values in favor of entertainment. "Fight fire with fire" means fight entertainment Putin and Trump with more entertainmet. It has wercked the Earth itself with climate change and religion entertainment wars. Trash mockery politics on Reddit outsells nonfiction sincere leaders. Rupert Murdoch's Fox News fiction outsells important science learning and comprehension. ===:::

"Germany investigated the Nordstream pipeline bombing like it was the most important thing ever. When they requested information from polish law enforcement about some people involved, Poland was like "lol, nah". It's a fucking war, why are we investigating the side that does these things to defend themselves and weaken the aggressor? And to what end? Are we going to arrest the Ukrainians that did it? It has no consequence now that it's done and it was a convenient way for Germany to get out of the remaining contracts without being held responsible for rising energy prices resulting from it.

Germany isn't even able to weaken the propaganda of the AfD, let alone working on tools to counter Russian propaganda."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : AfD is selling the message that hate and mocking of outsiders has long-term payoffs. That love and compassion should be abandoned in favor of addiction to hate and mass dehumanization. Which is more popular in video games, war and killing entertainment. Real life, authentic nonfiction learning - what Malala is begging people to do... doesn't sell like AfD and Russia's hate content. Comprehension and understanding are boring to people who want enemy to mock and hate. ===:::

Elon Musk does not have dementia. Tucker Carlson does not have dementia. The entire cast of Fox News fiction, Putin and Surkov, do not have dementia. Denial abounds that USA has lost an information war since March 2013.   
"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, **creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  (2nd) “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"Until last year, this sub had pictures of beautiful moments and marvelous places, and i joined for that reason. Now it feels like 2/3 of the posts are about Trump, and this post is a wish for his death. I don't like him either, but you guys are nuts. So do me a favor and ban me. I want to cut ties to this sub."

"Everything's become an opinion piece from conservative "news" outlets to even government health agencies.

 Trump hired his cabinet members for mainly just two reasons: 1) loyalty to him and not going to question Trump 2) telegenic and looks/sounds good on tv. 

Fox News personalities make up the majority of his cabinet because they're both fiercely loyal to Trump and have years of tv and media experience. With Kennedy, Trump fawns over the Kennedy legacy and desperately wants to be loved like JFK."

"The Kim regime is still going strong. Not much resistance against Putin or Xi. All dictatorships eventually fall but it can take generations before they do. And often they bring their own demise upon themselves through corruption and poor governance (like the USSR). It’s not very often that dictators are overthrown by their own people, and when they are they’re usually just replaced by another dictator."

"We Millennials need to do something. It’s a huge problem. The only thing we got was an education out of all this crap—we got some opportunity and we got some privilege from it.

But also, Gen X was the largest group that voted for Trump. And then our parents (Boomers) warned us about this crap, but then were brainwashed by it.

And I just feel bad for Gen Z. A lot of them have zero common sense. It’s insane."
