"The people who need to see it are balls deep in a giant propaganda campaign and will never see it, or will be told that's it's a good thing and won't question it."

"It's willful ignorance. The lack of critical thinking on display is remarkably insane.

People, family, friends, who have just been enveloped and blinded by the dog and pony show, reject any other news or sources as truth."

"I was literally talking about this at lunch with my friend the other day, the little press conference with Putin & Trump the other day following their meeting absolutely felt like Putin was mocking Trump and America right to his face and the man just doesn't see it lol."

"Trump will definitely blame Zelenskyy for this and say if Zelenskyy didn't start the war and just gave putin what he wants, that factory would not have been hit with a missile.

And then he'll blame the workers for being an easy target."

"It's a deliberate act to humiliate Trump on the world stage. This open disrespect towards America just means that they simply have to show to the public how Trump does nothing about it and how much they own America now."

"For real tho. I had this account "permanently" suspended by the admin bots for "harassment", for simply commenting in a thread about applying kinetic force to the faces of modern adherents of the tenets of national socialism. By some miracle I was able to successfully appeal the suspension to a human being.

However, because of this "permanent suspension", all of my alts got suspended for being associated to this account. Again, for the sole reason of this false "harassment" suspension that an AI bot dreamed up.

On each of those accounts I filed an appeal after this account was restored. In each case the appeal was rejected, because they found I "violated the rules", with no further clarification.

Again, this was all because their killbot falsely suspended this one account for what appeared to be an AI hallucination. I had not logged into the alts in months, and did not log into them until after this account was restored and found them suspended for no reason except they were associated to this account via the IP address."

"I’ve been catching up on all of my recommended screenings this year which are supposed to be “free” per ACA yet almost every one ends up with a charge or copay slapped on. It’s ridiculous. And most are billing errors! I legit spent 1.25 hrs on the phone to try to get $40 back on the last one."
