"I’m old enough to remember when the extreme right wing was concerned about the government black helicopters coming for them. After Ruby Ridge and Waco all they could scream about was government overreach and now they’re cheering on that same government to take over the cities…"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : What changed in USA is that March 2013 the Internet Research Agency in Russia started manipulating people's hearts and minds via social media. Now the USA is a population, We The People, addicted to fiction and out-group hate messaging. People are so engaged with the spectacle of memes and messages that they don't even recognize Russia won an information war and defeated the USA. [Authentic Reality has been *abandoned in favor of meme addiction*, Russsia won the information war](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). ===:::

"I don't see America surviving this. He's not leaving without violence. And now he has American, armed, troops in Washington DC. In a few years when he decides not to leave and he's surrounded by hand picked armed troops I don't see anything good happening.

Your country has gone. I doubt it's coming back."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Our country, USA, has gone into extreme media addiction. People have sold out the future of their children's lives to social machine addiciton. We have "Amused Ourselves To Death" on social machines and television HDTV networks (Fox News, Newsmax, etc). Putin won the information war. ===:::

"Trump is trying to make us numb to calling the military on US citizens. Seems like he’s normalizing this to enable his next coup attempt. My guess is he’s pissed the first one didn’t work because the people didn’t have the guns and the guts or the training and direction. Trump wants the military to be on his side for the next one. Is Trump replacing generals with Trump sycophants yet?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Meme addicts go: LOL, LMAO, so amusing, so hilarioius, so funny, Trump so entertaining. Nothing is real to people, it's just never-ending Reality TV fiction addiction and people don't want to see that attacking Canada "51 state" on the world stage has changed population of over 8 billion people in the world to see USA of only 0.34 billion as self-harm meme addicts to Trump entetainment LOL LOL LOL bullshit. ===:::
