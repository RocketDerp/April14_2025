* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit comment is not the flex one-line Twitter-lenth reply to a Laura Loomer Twitter-length message that the community thinks it is.

Mockind back is not resisting Tony Clifton methods / mocking back is not assertin nonfiction education of media ecology / media addiction behavior. It is being a media addict to simplistic "gotcha" low-effort noise mental states. That'show Russia defeated the USA since March 2013 using Twitter-think. This very Reddit comment is doing it.

Encourage Reddit community to trust a 22 year old person who blindly trusts the Trump White House / Trump and Putin administration. A 22 true believer that the future of the USA is served by these leaders. That's the expert Reddit message is calling for. Why not call for text messages and emails from OUTSIDE the incident that this Charlie Kirk shooter created over the past 10 years? They have been posting photos of him as a teenager on Reddit posing with guns and military hardwarew. Why not request hundreds of pages of his personal writings to friends and roommates? Because that is media ecology, and Reddit users want an ingorant population to constantly stimulate them with rerpetitive one-line jokes as Reddit comments. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : On Reddit can you trust other Reddit users with hidden identity, going to extreme efforts to conceal any identifying information? Yet here this Reddit user is with zero situational awareness of Reddit community https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 itself. Unable to cite any published authors or name the Internet Research Agency that mind-fucked MAGA and Reddit into polairty out-group hate patterns since march 2013. Why can't Reddit turn to actual nonfiction public library section and say more than Twitter-length reaction commetns every single minute of every single day over and over? Because Putin has *owned* the hearts and minds of USA sicne March 2013.

"And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where **even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives**, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, **a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies** is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

"This is Reddit. We don't do sources here."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Was one of the big changes in Reddit long-form comment culture when the Putin media invasion started in year 2013. People became far more concerned about insulting and mocking other people than educating and teaching - providing links and citations - that the Google search engine could hit upon topics and keywords. Even if the person you were directly replying to in public discourse didn't care about the link, 7 years later on Reddit a search engine hit could bring people to the old conversation. That media ecology self-awareness started to boil off in the out-group hate heat the IRA induced. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction content consumers get incredibly sad when a very old man, age 89, dies. A person they do not know except through film and television content. The same younger film media / movie media fiction addicts (Robert Redford context) **can not relate how fiction addicts to Charlie Kirk content (podcasts) being killed shockingly in public while speaking at a University has induced media mania in audience members**. There is a complete lack of comprehension of media ecology and how emotion (["heart strings" metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s)) are pulled and manipulated by wealth content holders / copyright holders. And who pulls such heart strings.

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?”

"The Russians could disappear into thin air and it would probably still take months for Ukraine to recapture the country.

Millions of landmines, anti-personnel traps, ditches, trenches, nets, tank traps, razor wire, poisoned wells, booby trapped houses and dugouts, caltrops, and many other horrible things stand between Ukraine and any hope of normalcy.

Dealing with those things will last decades after the last Russian gets turned into fertilizer."

"I agree, the headline is certainly a bit extreme.

To be as generous as possible to it, what I would say is that, on a larger scheme, the Russian offensive to take Pokrovsk has largely culminated. The disaster for Russia that was the “breakthrough” from a few weeks ago north of the city has really resulted in a major kneecapping of the already weakening push.

When you add to that Ukraine’s effective striking at logistics and assets that were recently diverted to the Pokrovsk offensive, it really points to the fact Russia is in trouble.

That also ignores the trouble brewing in the Sumy region for Russia as well with Ukraine now making flanking strikes into Russia itself at this point. Normally you’d think such a situation would warrant more assets, but we’re hearing that Russia is sending troops AWAY from Sumy and towards supporting the Pokrovsk offensive.

I think soon enough we may see the first month of more Ukrainian gains than Russian gains in a long time, and it won’t be due to a sudden massive rout. Ukraine is learning how to effectively clear out Russians, and Russia is rapidly losing the ability to maneuver cleanly and safely with the amount of armor lost."

"Not for pratically free unlike Ukraine. Russia has to pay China now for what they buy, at a premium as dodging sanctions and keeping things discrete tend to make a product more expensive.

Ukraine can run a Lend Lease tab and pay in decades after the conflict ends.

Or more recently they buy from US and the EU pays the bill.

The EU alone can outspend Russia by a large margin. Defense budgets are not even at 2%, NATO has not even entered the fight and Russia has been effectivelly stopped dead in its tracks with 1M casualties already."

They only desire to get their *fix* of the memes and junk message that are delivered on high speed networks, message notifications, content addictions. Reddit / Bluesky are everything anti-Wikipedia - against refined comprehension and understanding with citations and logging of every edit - and instead favor sucking down constant shit-quality low-effort comments that are constantly being genreated by the millions per hour on their feeds by anonymous (no-identity) users.

... ... ...
“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.
... ... ...
“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

"Either this or they think it’s disrespectful for some reason. The right is very sensitive even though they pretend the left is the sensitive ones."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-think Tweet-length mind pattens. This is a major misunderstanding of how humans behave regarding media ecology. Monomyth vs. Monomyth. Media system vs. Media system / systems. Study of Quran fiction media vs. Torah ficiton media, fiction vs. fiction, alternate-realty vs. alternate-reality reveal people get extremely agressive when their fiction story does not dominate the whole world ("God" above all else, Levant trillogy fiction storytelling). Even internal factions of a single-source science fiction storytelling, Quran, can have meme consumers attacking other meme consumers who read the exact same book. 
"The right is very sensitive even though they pretend the left is the sensitive ones" is out-grup hate patterns. Both groups are correct that human minds are extremel sensitive (all people, over 8 billion on earth) to their favorite media format / media venues / media seasoning / media flavoring / media tone / media storytelling regarding fiction addictions. Thinking that all human behavior is "left or right" is a horrible way of interpreting media ecology and human behaviors. Trying to apply how Bible fiction addicts sat in left or right (where there was no other choice of seating) in front of the King's throne is a practice of mental self-limiting taking to the extreme. A thought-terminating patten. Fiction vs. nonfiction is far more our USA situation regarding the crisis caused by the Internet Research Agency invasion of Redddit (and other) media systems since March 2013. People are fighting fiction vs. fiction, mythology vs mythology, monomyth vs. monomyth paterns as condiitioned by IRA deploying CA memepattern payloads.

"Theyre repeating history

We already saw this play out before

They came for socialists, communists, union leaders LGBTQ+ people, racial minorities, "Useless Eaters" and the "Work Shy"

We know where this is going. It has already happened before. It is infuriating watching it ramp up again.

The groundwork is being laid for establishing the out groups and outing them to peers and police. The borders are being primed for detaining and removing people.

Honestly, Americans in an "out" group, the time to leave was like... yesterday."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We are repeating history because we are in information overload. That was the heart of James Joyce's book Finnegans Wake, the patterns of mental overload and malfunction when conflicting fiction systems / mythology systems hit walls. We can learn the inward emotional control from history and not just act out our anger and hate.
... ... ...
“Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology. As his title indicates, he saw that the **wake of human progress can disappear again** into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of **tribal institutions can return** in the electric age, but if again, then let’s **make it a wake or awake or both**. Joyce could see **no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream**. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.” - from the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel.

That's what Trump provides for everyone, a person to insult and mock. A total population of 341 million people who prize and value hate messages and mockery of pople they disagree with, egomania self-harm. We could all unite and learn about Russian informationw warfare that streamed over the Internet since March 2013, but that is nonfiction, that is real reality.
