"There are literally tweets of MAGA mothers who said if Trump would rape their daughters they would be upset but they'd still vote for him. It's really far beyond the realm of anything resembling rational thinking.

People like this need to be barred from taking part in elections, for life. The age of the right to vote is over."

"Nah, they don't care. One of the analysts that I listen to often says that Russia uses a "post-truth" propaganda approach. They don't care about secrets because they systematically decrease the value of truth and fight against our ability to believe in anything.

"No, it was mostly the economy and while I think Biden did a good job people were still feeling economic pain and she basically said she would just keep doing what he was doing which a lot of people didn't understand had been working. Trump spoke to a lot of people's economic frustrations, and people also remember the economy being better under him at least up until covid (which I would argue was mostly just him riding Obama's coattails but yeah doesn't change people's memories of better times)."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I agree: "Trump spoke to a lot of people's economic frustrations" - that greed and rich people need more. That's the frustrations of Trump media addicts. That the rich people don't make fancy enough films or war footage and things need to be more Reality TV / fiction Internet meme like all the time. Economic frustrations that the wealthy don't get enough free speech. Economic frustrations that Putin can't just take Ukraine and anything he wishes. What good is wealth and power if you can't do everything your nightmares tell you to do? "it was mostly the economy"... no, it is all about entertainment addiction. Trump provides Tony Clifton mockery and hate. The economy of memes, the economy of media content addictions. ===:::

"She was worse than status quo. She was a historically unpopular, gun toting, genocide supporting moderate that campaigned with Republicans. But we were supposed to vote for her because she's black and a woman. The DNC learned the hard way that identity politics and whataboutisms don't win elections."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We The People of Reddit / Bluesky don't ever learn. People act like "learning the hard way" is a proven system of understanding and comprehension. If that were **true true**, then the Middle East would have leanred the hard way how many thousands of years ago? Toxic poluarity is not evidence of popularity being good. Democracy does not work when people toss compassion and love into the trash in favor of meme addictions on Reddit. A meme society unwilling to study media ecology and Russian information warfare thinking this situation is only domestic USA elections and not global information war. Apparently, there isn't enough Trump praising Putin in public for Reddit community to go read nonfiction books about how Russia actually operates. Reddit infiltrated by Kremlin mind-fuck.

"I don’t think people are grasping the gravity of the situation: the tariffs Trump has placed, have already put the farming and steel industry in a very precarious position.

This is the bubble with a needle inches away from popping it. This isn’t a “this will definitely happen in x amount of time!” It’s in the “if a gust of air hits this bubble, there’s a very real and very tangible chance it’s floating not only in the direction of that needle, but directly into it.”

Economically, it would not seem to take a large fumble to set in motion a catastrophe in similar proportions to what happened in 2008.

Very much a “not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’” "

These aren’t issues that can easily be fixed with time."

That media addiction / meme addiction / trash media consumption of ficton has wrecked goodness itself. That The Middle East Bible is science fiction and we are not equating the 2,000 year old Bible poblem to Fox News / Newsmax / Reddit / Bluesky fiction addiction problem in modern mediums.

We the PEOPLE addressing that Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton is mockery addiciton, mocking and insulting how terrile and bad Clifton is at being on stage.

"Dems have high key been fumbling elections for years now.  Reddit hates having this conversation, but there’s nothing unifying the left.  Every election has people at each other’s throats until they finally decide on a candidate, only for people to just straight up not vote because it wasn’t the Democratic candidate that *they* wanted.

Hopefully these next two years can finally get people to the polls because, for as much as I thought Biden did a fine job, there hasn’t been a strong Democratic competitor since Obama."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : New corporations come up all the time. Reddit itself was created, a technology startup. Why do Reddit community members think the only possible answer in democracy / free society is to "Democrats party". Why not create a list of things you want, post it on Reddit, and show that people actually desire goodness itself. Alas, people do indeed do this, and find that the audience is addicted to left vs. right one-bit logic thinking. Which the Founding Fathers did not promote in the Decleration of Independence, Great Seal, or Constitution. The boundless faith that there are TWO and ONLY TWO sides to every problem: Republican vs Democrat!  One-bbit thinking. Which the Founding Fathers recognized and in year 1776 created the Great Seal of the United States of America as a teching tool. Fiction vs. nonfiction. Mythology vs. scieence. Not left vs. right logic. Not single-bit, but 13-steps on the pyramid up the Great Seal. "there hasn’t been a strong Democratic competitor since Obama" - which is declaring that Donald Trump is a great competititor. Trump selling fiction, Donald Trump and Fox News sell fiction. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Obama was the *last* before the Internet Research Agency (IRA, Russia) took over Reddit / Twitter / everyone mindsets. Fiction addiction vs. science reality. We have normalized a Russian supporter (Trump and Tucker Carlson and many others) as a healthy candidate for President. We The People lost a mind-fuck war without even realizing, zero self-awareness of the situation. "Dems have high key been fumbling elections for years now" is WRONG - CORRECTED: the Pentagon has fumbled hybrid warfare since March 2013. ===:::
