"Not just your country. I'm in fucking Canada and out of 6 immediate neighbours 3 are Maple MAGA and are all women.

I made the mistake of bringing up politics with one the other day...    
*"Oh I love what Trump is doing down there. He's a hero, we need someone like that in Canada"*   
*"Why don't you move down to the States then?"* -me   

F%#$ing irony is that she's on disability and benefitting from a long list of social services which would be the first to be cut under a Trumplike regime.   
I keep saying that MAGA is not a problem unique to America: similar parties and sentiments are rising worldwide. Even darker days are ahead."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The MAGA "movement" is not unique to USA, and people keep ignoring that Putin and Trump are best buddies and working together. The Internet Research Agency worked with Cambridge Analytica as agreed by Trump in November 2012 to alter the minds and behaviors of ALL PEOPLE.
"Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.", "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа.", "Дальше оставалось только загрузить эти данные в информационные потоки и социальные сети."

"There is also the historic example of Hitler, Mussolini or Kadafi. Unfortunate that they dragged a lot of people to the grave before them. Let’s see if America truly is the special country we claim we are and how far we will be dragged before it’s gets stopped in its tracks. I remember, a long time ago, in high school history classes thinking “ how did the German people let that happen?”. It’s becoming a haunting thought now when I can see how easily it’s happening here and how meaningless the word “American” can become with so much un-American activity being condoned by supposedly very self declared American Patriots."

"And yet they call people on the left “snowflakes”. 

I’ve been over there and seen the circlekerking they do, it’s laughable. “The left don’t like reality and facts!” and “Anything they don’t agree with, they lose their shit!” It’s like they’re completely lacking any self-awareness. 

Obviously not all of them are like that, some actually question Trump and the Government’s actions, those people then get accused of being “Brigaders”. 

So any dissenting voices must be secret liberals, just like the Conservative politicians who came out against Trump during the election. All this time, they were secretly Liberal plants. 

Utterly fucking bizarre and bereft of any self-awareness or intelligence."

"The only joy I’m getting out of this disaster is watching the Trump voters get screwed by the guy they were willing to move heaven and earth to re elect."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Murder / suicide pact thinking. Islamoc terrorist logic: my death is good because I get to take people who don't like my fiction Quran story interpretaiton. down with me. Reddit fiction content addicts thrilled to have murder/suicide nation of Fox News addicts taken down with them. Anti-Malala, avoidant of nonfiction, avoidant of education and teaching. What Surkov saw that few others recognized, that James Joyce articulates so beautifuly in his Dublin metaphors of Finnegans Wake, is that human brains can be exploited to see thrills of SYSTEMS killing people. The Fderal Governing SYSTEM is harming Trump voters, so Reddit users are thrilled to see humans crushed by a system. This was a core focus of Finnegans Wake illumination of Dublin society behaviors in year 1924. You can see this pattern play out all over the world, where people cheer on goernments and systems and coprorations who harm human beings. ""The only joy I’m getting out of this disaster is watching the Trump voters get screwed" by the *system of government*, by the machinery of the state. Reddit social machine addicts love machines, hate human persons. The thrill that messages off Fox News machines can destroy human lives, the thrill that Reddit messages can destroy human lives. That is what the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica has condtioned the ENTIRE popualtion, all inclusive, even non-voters, even children age 12 exposed to their own partent's 'second hand smoke' (metaphor) of Cambridge Analytica mind programming (message patterns like: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 ).
"The only joy I’m getting out of this disaster is watching the Trump voters get screwed by the guy they were willing to move heaven and earth to re elect." - **note that the person is not describing authentic joy** that comes from *resucing people from Trump and Murdoch and Putin*, but a militant stimulation (terrorists) of "joy" from watching human persons harmed by Donald Trump Systems. ===:::

His friends and family are the ones he sees as people. He has no qualms about asking her to leave everything she knows behind to benefit him but he refuses to reciprocate."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit users don't see Trump supporters as human persons, they view them as enemy compbatants to cheer on their self-harm and destruciton at the hands of Putin's information warfare since March 2013. They make no effort to rescue American people wrecked by the Internet Research Agency, they find it entertaining and thrilling to use their spare time and free time to kick the mentally injured and cheer on Putin's information warfare success. Americans hate Americans and are trhilled to see Americans suffering at the hands of anti-NATO information warfare. These are educated Americans on Reddit (typically white collar) with free time and spare time to make messaging sport of dehumanizing Amrerican people as Russian systems replace and take over classical USA values in 2025. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america ===:::
