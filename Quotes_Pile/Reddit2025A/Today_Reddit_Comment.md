"Ya know, the shittiest part of this is that even though that dude is an utterly useless asshat I will still fight for his right to survive.

I'm so tired of these fuckalls who suck from the government teat and complain about the government offering other people besides them assistance as well."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We have a massive media ecology crisis described 40 years ago in Neil Postman's year 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To DeatH" about television news systems. Adult education isn't optional. We need to educate people why Fox News is wrong, we can't keep leeting rural uneducated adults in USA not comrprehend how Facbook, Fox News, Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter works on their mind. Russia won, Surkov won the information war since March 2013 because we did not educate rural Americans with media ecology. Neil Postman's 1985 book was essential for the smartphone age, and we did not teach it to every adult. ===:::

"The only reason I wish I was still on X is to see all the people replying to this moron telling him he did, in fact, vote for this."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit user commenting may not be on X / Twitter media platform, but the message they created on Reddit is Twitter-like and short-length Tweet-thinking. Just telling people "you voted for this" and sitll having them vote for the next fiction storyteller to feed their fiction addiciton to short simplistic Twitter-style ideas does not address the problem in any way, shape, or form. Neil Postamn's **book is only 184 pages, a SOCIETY WIDE education campaign to get EVERY PERSON on the SAME PAGE** of the 184 page book "Amusing OUrselves To Death" - ALL PEOPLE, age 12 to age 120, NEED TO LEARN. Just saying "you voted for this" is not in any way addressing the underlying cause of the Russian win of the information war. Moscow won, Surkov won! ===:::

"SNL has been satirizing him for years. There‚Äôs the giant Trump baby float at protests. It‚Äôs just weird that this of all things riles em up.

I assume it‚Äôs because the mockery is coming from a powerful governor like Newsom."

"I just saw the video of her meltdown. It was infuriating seeing her being completely obtuse as to what Newsom is doing. Saying that his wife needs to check on him and he needs to get off twitter. But it‚Äôs ok for a POTUS to do this?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : people on Reddit are behaving as if Donald Trump never had a first term in office, was elected way back in year 2016. Recency bias abounds. Russia won the information war, people have their minds blown so incredbily easy since the IRA and CA mind-fucked the population. This isn't just since January 20, 2025 - the United States of America has been flocking to Donald Trump's tweet bullshit styles for over a decade! Denial abounds. Russia won hearts and minds :( ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I wonder if Russia Internet Research Agency started creating messages in various styles and enslaved the minds of the USA population to a *style and tone* of media addiction since March 2013, and people in USA all think it is HILARIOUS and AMUSING. Neil Postman's 1985 book about media systems / media ecology / electric media ["Amusing Ourselves To Death" is not OPTIONAL learning in the Twitter age](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/)! ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : stimulated by Twitter content. That's how you feel, stimulated. That's what Donald Trump provides every hour of every day for over a decade, constant electric media stimulation. Fiction addiction is fed. Anticipation to the next "Q Drop", the next reaction to the Tony Clifton performance act that Donald Trump has mastered working with Putin / Surkov media systems out of Russia. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addiction is the key to populatoin.

"That boooooomer lead paint eating stare that comes from trumpers when they get all mad and enraged that they finally realize how much of a remedial trump is and they are moronic for having supported him. Glorious. Then they double down on "but but but but" and get all frothy that you point out that they are really mad at trump and they cant handle it and shut down.

edit, having to censor myself because I cant call maga stupid names now? WTF"

"It's mind blowing. They'll talk about Biden being unable to finish a sentence. Biden is an old man with a stutter. Trump has always been a babbling idiot. How can ANYONE listen to him talk and think he's some sort of genius? He's a moron and that's before his dementia started to get really bad."

"I do the same.

I get a kick out of when they get down voted and start whining about the liberal brigade. It never occurs to them that they could just have an unpopular opinion üòÇ."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This is why I track goodness messages across the whole world. Good ideas for humanity are good ideas. You see people discussing Palestine and Israel content CONSTANTLY on Reddit and Bluesky in year 2024 and year 2025. But what you DO NOT see is people saying: *we need another MLK jr*, it is the absence of goodness. People all KNOW OF Martin Luther King Jr, but you don't witness peopel saying: Bernie Sanders is right to keep bringing up MLK Jr. Why aren't we doing it? Why aren't we giving attention to someone preaching and teaching from MLK Jr's recorded materials, books and such? Malala was on the world stage, global attention, for **education and teaching**, her father is a teacher. And she came to attention in year 2012 and year 2013, right when Donald Trump popularity is formulating. But people are incredibly avoidant of goodness itself. " It never occurs to them that they could just have an unpopular opinion" - yha, like Neil Postman on media addiciton is *unpopular*, and like Malala from Pakistan on education is *unpopular*, and Carl Sagan's 1995 book is *unpopular*. You know what is popular? Americans hate Americans in August 2025. Constantly dunking, insulting, name-caling, hating up USA people. **Toxic Popularity** of hate magnet Donald Trump. Joe Rogan is popular. Fox News is popular. ===:::

"To the degenerate and morally corrupt scum of the earth which is all leftists, righteousness, truth and the light will be loathsome. Thats why you hate Trump and righteousness so much because you all are despicable filth and yet again, in traditional democrat fashion, are on the wrong side of history. KKK, pro slavery, internment camps, infanticide, anti personal accountability, you all applauded tranies twerking like strippers at toddlers in libraries across America, tried to control the narrative in regards to homosexuals teaching gay tendencies and explicit homsexual acts in public schools, support and create ways for pedophiles to be a protected class by creating bullshit labels like MAPS and other evil degeneracy. We have the moral high ground and you and the rest of the degenerates from the left can keep seething and watching how men take charge and protect not only American children but tens out thousands of immigrant children who are no longer being sex trafficked for your cult lords' homsexual pleasures. Viva Cristo Rey!"

"Because they‚Äôve isolated themselves so heavily that they honestly believe the only issue anyone has with him is his crassness on social media when in reality most people aren‚Äôt even aware of his mindless posts anymore. These people purposely avoid staying abreast of all the awful and detrimental things he does so they can stay supportive and when something does reach them they just chalk it up to being fake. Their choice of media gave them everything Biden did under a slanted microscope but is focused entirely on culture wars and distractions under Trump.

It‚Äôs why some of them seem so baffled when one of DTs insane policies of the week leaks through their safety net and they have to grapple with something he‚Äôs done that they don‚Äôt like. This is a carefully constructed house of cards that requires complete lobotomization to keep up with and devotion to media avenues that keep up the charade"

"there‚Äôs about a million things wrong with this but for me it‚Äôs the hypocrisy cause trump is constantly talking down on people like obama and biden, throwing around horrible insults and accusations yet he‚Äôs silent then??

why is it always the left who is expected to be the bigger person when the one in the white house is the biggest bully of them all? he constantly takes credit for things he didn‚Äôt do and deflects blame for things he did wrong onto biden or obama."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The whole *left vs. right* binary logic thinking is a mental trap. Look at Fox News, Donald Trump, Elon Musk Twitter, Taliban and other groups in terms of **fiction vs. nonfiction**, science vs. fiction storytelling (The Bible science fiction, Quran science fiction, Torah science fiction). Addiction to fiction explains Donald Trump popularity. ===:::
