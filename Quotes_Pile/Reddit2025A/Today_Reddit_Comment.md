"It's shocking how quickly the US turned into Russia and it's even more shocking how their own people are cheering for it"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Internet Mesarch Agency and Cambridge Analytica deployed mental manipulation starting in March 2013. Several years before the November 2016 election win by Donald Trump. People do not take seriously the behavior changes in USA population. Terse, flippant, dismissive, avoidant of nonfiction. Donald Trump entertainer is valued above nonfiction sincere leaders. People compulsively spend all their free time and spare time insulting, mocking, name-calling, mimicking Donald Trump. Attracted to the total mockery unlike any other area of life. Donald Trump is bigger than all the top 10 video games, all the top 10 films, all the top ten sports events COMBINED in how much people can not resist mocking and insulting the Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People do not want to face up how Saudi Arabia and Mecca operate, how Putin and Surkov use antics politics in Russia, etc. Motivating a population to murder neighbors in Ukraine is no small feat. Being a killer, blood on your hands, is no minor life experience. Russia has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014 and the people of Russia are so programmed and conditioned that it keeps going on and on. USA people have been more and more attracted to, flocking to, self-harm and dehumanization with Trump. The behaviors are in your face. People will not stop mocking, insulting, name-calling,dehumanizing "the others" in USA. Every day, the same attractions. ====:::

"So coverage here in Denmark, is that DR (danish national media) has uncovered a plot with 3 individuals with close ties to Trump, operating in Greenland trying to create false narratives, that would hurt the Greenlandic relationship with Denmark, with the goal of creating a Greenlandic “independence movement” in support of Trump taking over.

It violates several international laws, and will probably hurt ties between Denmark and the US further, unfortunately."

"No, they are connected to how many people were killed that were working for western organizations. Last time there was an apology was the WCK bombing. Now the journalists that were killed were working for western publications."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users could be organizing sending thousands of inexpensive smartphoens with SD cards to haeve *everyday people* record video of events and have multiple people show what is happening. In an information war - document how people are starving and being bombed. Organize pickup locations for SD cards every 12 hours and a system to publish the videos from Amman Jordan or other neary by Internet stable location. This has been going on since October 2023 and social media society is not organizing to show thousands of indepenent *non-professional* people given a democratic voice in the situation. People are not asserting Malala's excellent ideas about terrorism on social media. Instead, people react to Israel over and over and over, reactionary thinking. Anti-progress thinking. Social media society has all the signs of beig media addicted to the daily news events and not actually haing copassion for EVERYDAY people being given voice like Malala's focus on EVERYDAY people being given voice through education and stable information systems (stable education / learning systems). ===:::

"The consequences are they lost their moral high ground forever now. Every time going forward there's a 'oh the holocaust' people will parallel it to what Israel is doping in Gaza. People are realising this has been going on, to a lesser extent than today, but for the last 70 years.

From what they are doing now Israel will lose a bunch of global support, possibly even USA over time. While they enjoy a powerful position in ME today, without big brother to arm and defend them things could really change over the longer term.

From that even with ethics and humanitarian reasons aside, this has been a horrible decision by Netanyahu, They get a little more land but the people will always be on the other side of the fence and now their global support will shrink."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think media addicts are entertained by horror films, wars footage, video of suffering, photographs of others suffering and being terrorized. Content creation is what many people favor over compassion and love. Addicts to media reacting to every event of war, not calling for Malala's **nonfiction** solutions to end war - but instead react-commenting on Reddit and other media platforms and media systems keeps audiences glued to streaming information devices. ==:::

So conditioned that violence solves problems. Domestic violence being encouraged constantly when we are dealing with media addiction problems.

When the smaller businesses go belly-up they will be bought out for pennies on the dollar by larger corporations which will charge higher rates for shittier service and then blame woke or DEI for the business failing.

"Ah, it’s hard to know, but yeah, women tend to be very vindictive and often don’t show the same level of comradery as male teams.

For me, I remember that if anything like that happened, you were expected to confront the person as a team, and if there was a scuffle, the whole team had to be involved. That’s how we were trained. Never allow the other team to bully you, but also never be the aggressor.

Antagonizing is appreciated tho... so it's a thin line.

With all that said, intentionally targeting the setter during warm-up is literally the biggest sin you can commit in volleyball, and it usually culminates in scuffles or fights.

You would always get punished for losing your temper, but you would be punished even more if you dont have your teammate's back.

At my level this would likely mean a DQ for the other team or red card for the player who did this.

You simply cannot do it, because you can concuss them. Volleyball can do real damage, and when you strike at average speeds above 100 km/h, you don’t get a chance to react. It feels like a sucker punch and can eliminate you from the game.

It always interests me that this stuff happens in the NBA or Volleyball, and the difference in reactions between men and women is very apparent. I’m assuming it has a lot to do with coaching culture."

"I've got a theory that some people think being smart is just being contrarian, like just claiming the opposite all the time.

Also, I think there is a lot of past propaganda, like hard decisions have to be made, these few people must die so more can live, etc. But it's all purely reactionary, the thought ending random claim.

US culture has largely propagated this phenomenon due to how “cool”, “smart” or “manly” characters are portrayed in art and film. They’re usually witty and clever, and will verbally eviscerate anyone that dares challenge their morality or intellect, usually in a flashy or humorous way.

All these idiots are trying to be Deadpool or the Joker but they forget that requires actual charisma, humor, and intelligence. Because if you don’t have those you just come off as an over-confident brainless douche.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Americans hate Americans.

"she would be all thumbs up and giggles if this was happening to someone else which is exactly what makes everyone of them a horrible person."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Americans hate Americans. Every person in USA now hates upon other people in USA. Exactly as condttioned by Russia and Cambridge Analytica since March 2013. People who hate Trump suppporters, hate upon MAGA have *adopted* the values of Trump and MAGA. Out-group hate is what Putin and Surkov weaponized. Hate upon Canada, hate upon NATO, etc. There is no condemnation of hate and dehumanization for ALL people, it is about mob mentality of out-group attacking. People in filtr bubbles of media attacking tree clusters without seeing the total NATO forest of Russian information systems warfare. ===:::

"You had a choice and chose to give America ass cancer. Don't fucking cry about it. This was all you. Own this shit. The whole country gets fucked because you're an idiot who rejected facts. Why the fuck would anyone have sympathy for you? MAGA made it a point to let half the country know to fuck their feelings. So stop being a snowflake. If you're finally big mad, fucking do something about it. Don't whine like a softie. You know who is fucking you over. You know his name. You know he doesn't give a solitary fuck about we the people or the country he is destroying. Do something about it. Nobody gives a shit about your tears. You made it this way."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  The ever-popular Elon Musk repeating IRA messaging: 1) hate upon Americans, 2) anti-empathy, 3) anti-compassion, 4) anti-education and teaching. The general message of *hate harder*, that will improve the future of the USA. A USA that shows zero mercy, a USA that has no forgiveness, a USA that revels in using pain and suffering to teach poor people a lesson about rich people's needs. Billionares like Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch fucked-over the minds of USA population to hate, and people revel in the situation of being able to punch down on people who were mind-fucked by Cambridge Analytica.

"I was talking to my brother about this yesterday. Like, I feel like I would be more understanding if people like my mom and my sister just owned it instead of pretending like this isn’t what they voted for.

I want my mom and my sister and other trump voters to tell me loud and proud “yes we voted for this and we voted to send the national guard into your stupid fucking liberal city!” At least have some fucking conviction and stop playing the fucking victim with all this shit."

Sucking down trash off Reddit, their primary concern and addiction is to fiction and don't care to teach and educate people about **cult deprogramming and information warfare**, they jsut declare anyone they don't grasp or understad to be in a cult and step over the inured that Russia mind-fucked since March 2013. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : A meme addled population of social media addicts unable to recognize this is all part of Putin's plan since 2012 before invading Ukraine in February 2014. Can't mentally process that this is self-harm to USA future even if Trump just met Putin in Alaska this month. Just reacting to tree after tree of events FOR TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS on social machines unable to see the total forest of Kremlin strategy to wreck the USA mentally. [Another meme addled eater of Surkovian onions who thinks this is is only USA, not multiple NATO nations under mind-fucking attack](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). Trained by the IRA since March 2013, "somehow his trained seals will rationalise this" - not just MAGA, not just Republicans, not just Trump supporters - but all social media users who can't study and describe Russian information warfare. Universities are at the heart of information warfare, organized campaigns to continue to pummel Americans into meme stupors. ===:::

"That’s smart let the country who is know for surveillance and spying bring all their people into the country. While moving others out lol. Morons. Tim Cook just wants his people back to work his factories. Never mind national Security"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. **The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies**. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.”

"Because social media and TV made a low IQ wealthy con man look like some kind of business genius on a reality "show". They made another wealthy nerd who steals ideas and buys inventions look like some kind of great innovator and genius. The people were manipulated and lied to in order for the wealthiest people in the country to gain control. Who were the people behind this brainwashing of the American people? More wealthy elites working to pad their investments and ensure the profits continue to pour in."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Who were the people behind this brainwashing of the American people?" - viewing this as a unique to USA issue. The same human brain falls for the same games all over the world. Putin in Russia, Saudi Arabia with Quran and Mecca. Fiction storytelling outsells nonfiction science. We can euducate *every person* on comaprative mythology. We can teach the global pattern of self-harm faith in fiction. Media ecology is not optional learning. ===:::

"Every time there is a school shooting, MAGAs rush home to hug their guns."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Every time MAGA or Donald Trump has a ***BREAKING NEWS*** notification, media addicts in the United States Of America go home to caress their touchscreen and feel the warmth of the device in their handds as they react-comment how much they hate American people they disagree with. As long as the system keeps deliveirng Trump content. Instead of learning and teaching how Russian information warfare works, twitter-thinking short-idea message addicts create trash social media comment messages with their free time and spare time FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS since Donald Trump became the center of all attention every minute of every day. Mocking and insulting and name-calling just like Trump, behaving like Trump, turning the entire nation into a total mockery. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Audiences glued to the Tony Clifton performers media end-point screens, glued to their entertainment devices with hate-filled emotions towards every message. GOING ON FOR TEN FUCKING YEARS, never wanting to confront that media addiction is the very force of Putin's information warfare since March 2013. Entirely addicted to the ideas of punching and hitting people stimulation from the electronic information devices. Constantly avoiding nonfiction learning and study of mob mentality and why hate as a motivation creates a toxic society in total. United States of Hate. Humanism discarded, education and comprehension trashed in the name of pro-hate pro-violence messaging nonstop. ===:::

"The thing is, the stories they cover are still framed quite favorable for him, all things considered. Always sanewashing his bullshit and giving the benefit of the doubt. They don't talk at all as much as they should about the plethora of constitutional and rights violations the administration is committing. They aren't showing the true horrors unless the public is already overwhelmingly talking about them. They aren't doing anything to keep the public informed really. The even carefully chose their camera angles to make mass protests seem like little get togethers.together.

All of corporate media really downplay how much he if screwing us. Litterally killing our country, but they all seem to stick to a chosen set of authorized talking points. Corporations want him in office. Yes even the "liberal media" corporations. Corporations don't give a damn about your country, and your constitution and rights are just things that get in their way.

What we are told are "liberal" corporate news outlets serve only as a feeding tube to guide naratives of more passive news consumers so the conversation doesn't stray to far from what billionaired are comfortable with.

Corporate media is Controlled Opposition"

"Yet all of our parents love him uncritically. I never thought we'd see such an immense, unbridgeable generational divide in values like this. Hearing them praise Trump's actions and talk about how they "finally feel safe for the first time in their lives" with literal tears in their eyes is just insane to me."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media society can't seem to relate this to the experience of people in love with sports stars, famous music stars.A true fan of a telvision show or sports plyer who behaves more seriously about the sports star than their own children.

"Greenland may know of specific individuals in their country currently, but foreign agents don’t need to be physically present to use propaganda in an effort to destabilize a country.

With the Internet and software, one foreign agent may pretend to be hundreds to thousands of local citizens, using stolen or AI-generated images to make you believe they are local people. All they need to do is support all side of any controversial issue."
