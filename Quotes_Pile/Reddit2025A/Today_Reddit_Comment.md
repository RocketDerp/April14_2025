"Good god. If there are Americans who still are not ashamed of this shitclown, then the country truly is lost."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addiction rules the USA population. We The People can not resist mocking and insulting Tony Clifton acts of the Trump White House. Endless mockery and name-claling ("shitclown') for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS. Amusement entertainment addiction, media machine addiciton to endless streaming antics. ===:::

"Lmao how is he president"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : LOL LOL LOL meme-speak amused Twiter-thinking 5-word comment messages all over every media system. Social media laugh-track messaging. How is Donald Trump President and ruler of all society media systems behaviors for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS?
“Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

"The "you" she is talking to is Democrats and D voters ... and that's what Trump is doing ... and that's why Republicans and MAGA love it and are foaming at the mouth for fascism."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We the people are "foaming at the mouth" for nonstop mocking and insulting. Donald Trump playing acting the Tony Clifton performances (now augmented with others) is Surkov governing techniques of Russia year 2011. People are meme-addeled, drunk on trash mockery of Donald Trump, minds blown by the never-ending total mockery that Putin and Trump create. We The People are uanble to exit the meme stupors and face up that absurd surreal comedy, mind-blowing antics amsuement, are the foundation of Trumpism / MAGA mental exploits. Social machine addicts are **foaming at the mouth** over "karens" and images every day, Putin and Trump have mastered this as a form of governing.
"Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics." - December 31, 2014. BBC, Adam Curtis ===:::

"You could do a whole psychology degree on if Trump is immoral or amoral."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : One person could get an education degree. The problem is the entire population age 12 to age 120, but fixation on only Donald Trump as status symbol and icon of society has everyone adopt Trumpism egoism. The addiction to fiction, the avoidance of nonfiction, explains MAGA / Trump / USA September 2025. In fiction, you can be immoral and amoral both - just like the Middle East values fiction above all else (Scince fiction stories of Torah / Quran / Bible). ===:::

"only idiots pretended like these types of warnings were overblown or exaggerated. same idiots keep reporting on what’s going on daily like it’s not the most insane shit."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction addicts are not *pretending* they are addicted to fiction storytelling. Go live and study the Middle East and North Africa like I did during the Arab Sprirng with an eye on media ecology. It isn't pretending! Russian people who believe Putin are not pretending the past 25 years with Surkov fiction-based governing systems. ===:::

"That’s not a “gotcha.” They lied. They know. Their voters know. We know. Lying is the point — they want to downplay it. They will deny reality to downplay it.

The reality is that at best they are creating a two-tier society where all non-whites are subject to scrutiny about their legal status at any time. Employing a non-white will carry risk of disruption and loss of revenue to your business because they will be taken and interrogated for days without notice."
