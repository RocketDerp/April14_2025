"Not just your country. I'm in fucking Canada and out of 6 immediate neighbours 3 are Maple MAGA and are all women.

I made the mistake of bringing up politics with one the other day...    
*"Oh I love what Trump is doing down there. He's a hero, we need someone like that in Canada"*   
*"Why don't you move down to the States then?"* -me   

F%#$ing irony is that she's on disability and benefitting from a long list of social services which would be the first to be cut under a Trumplike regime.   
I keep saying that MAGA is not a problem unique to America: similar parties and sentiments are rising worldwide. Even darker days are ahead."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The MAGA "movement" is not unique to USA, and people keep ignoring that Putin and Trump are best buddies and working together. The Internet Research Agency worked with Cambridge Analytica as agreed by Trump in November 2012 to alter the minds and behaviors of ALL PEOPLE.
"Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.", "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа.", "Дальше оставалось только загрузить эти данные в информационные потоки и социальные сети."

"There is also the historic example of Hitler, Mussolini or Kadafi. Unfortunate that they dragged a lot of people to the grave before them. Let’s see if America truly is the special country we claim we are and how far we will be dragged before it’s gets stopped in its tracks. I remember, a long time ago, in high school history classes thinking “ how did the German people let that happen?”. It’s becoming a haunting thought now when I can see how easily it’s happening here and how meaningless the word “American” can become with so much un-American activity being condoned by supposedly very self declared American Patriots."

"And yet they call people on the left “snowflakes”. 

I’ve been over there and seen the circlekerking they do, it’s laughable. “The left don’t like reality and facts!” and “Anything they don’t agree with, they lose their shit!” It’s like they’re completely lacking any self-awareness. 

Obviously not all of them are like that, some actually question Trump and the Government’s actions, those people then get accused of being “Brigaders”. 

So any dissenting voices must be secret liberals, just like the Conservative politicians who came out against Trump during the election. All this time, they were secretly Liberal plants.

Islamoc terrorist logic: my death is good because I get to take people who don't like my fiction Quran story interpretaiton. down with me. Reddit fiction content addicts thrilled to have murder/suicide nation of Fox News addicts taken down with them. Anti-Malala, avoidant of nonfiction, avoidant of education and teaching. What Surkov saw that few others recognized, that James Joyce articulates so beautifuly in his Dublin metaphors of Finnegans Wake, is that human brains can be exploited to see thrills of SYSTEMS killing people. The Fderal Governing SYSTEM is harming Trump voters, so Reddit users are thrilled to see humans crushed by a system. This was a core focus of Finnegans Wake illumination of Dublin society behaviors in year 1924. You can see this pattern play out all over the world, where people cheer on goernments and systems and coprorations who harm human beings. ""The only joy I’m getting out of this disaster is watching the Trump voters get screwed" by the *system of government*, by the machinery of the state. Reddit social machine addicts love machines, hate human persons. The thrill that messages off Fox News machines can destroy human lives, the thrill that Reddit messages can destroy human lives. That is what the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica has condtioned the ENTIRE popualtion, all inclusive, even non-voters, even children age 12 exposed to their own partent's 'second hand smoke' (metaphor) of Cambridge Analytica mind programming (message patterns like: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 ).

"I feel like we’re being isolated, little by little"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"The folks behind all this are people like Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management and primary author of project 2025) and Howard Lutnick (commerce secretary and former Cantor Fitzgerald which is the biggest supporter of the heritage foundation). They want an era of isolationism for the U.S. because they think this country can prosper with the right access to raw materials and straight labor. It’s why they are working on shutting down access to proper education, having Trump go on and on about acquiring Canada and Greenland which is partly for resources and accessibility but also as a buffer zone to the rest of the world. They have been convinced into thinking AI will figure out all the problems with Elon Musk (SpaceX/Starshield/Starlink/Grok) and Peter Thiel/Palantir. Elon Musk has already announced he won’t push for a 3rd party, instead he is putting his support behind Vance. With Trump being sick it’s not long before Vance is in control.

Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team which most people have forgotten is really USDS which has access to most federal agencies. Understand that the decision by Trump to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far. Timothy Haugh like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir (just got $10 BILLION contract with the US government) who is now the biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA based on publicly available data on DOD contracts (they had $750 million added to their current contract a while back) along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies. ⁠Palantir is contracted with state and local governments and police here in the U.S. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.

Now comes the push for removing Trump from office.

Elon was the early test to see if scapegoat mechanism would work and it sort of did for him. Which is sort of the plan, scapegoat mechanism at its finest. Peter is a ⁠key believer of scapegoat mechanism for which he says Trump fills that role. Thiel has been grooming JD Vance since 2011 as his benefactor and mentor, Thiel brought Vance to Mar-a- Lago to smooth over things with Trump so Vance could be VP, Thiel gave Vance $15 million in donations to run for Senate (the largest amount of money ever donated to a single Senate candidate ever)

Scapegoat mechanism is simple that you have someone in power take on a lot of bad actions then remove them and so the masses feel it’s been all undone. The test case was Elon and DOGE which worked perfectly seeing as how all the federal investigations into Elon are gone and DOGE is still at all the federal agencies. Elon’s employee Amanda Scales still has the private server setup at OPM. All the data they got from the federal agencies and Treasury department when they had hard physical access is still under their control.

In September when the gap fund bill signed in March expires along with the deferred resignation program kicking in and the SSA/IRS data being handed over to Palantir as part of the doge plan they have provided for updating the SSA system there could be a lot of reasons for him to be removed from office.

Peter Thiel/Palantir just got what they wanted, access to a big enough database for the first step in complete surveillance.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/30/trump-citizenship-database

Peter is also a major defense contractor for the UK intelligence community and army along with the major police forces in the UK. He branched out to their healthcare a few years ago with a contract to shift through all the data at NHS England which is done now so Kier announced that NHS England will be shutdown (not NHS). Peter through his company has full access to Norway’s government and civilian surveillance services. Peter/Palantir provides direct support for the IDF (Israel) in all their operations from Gaza to the West Bank to Iran.

Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7

Alex Karp the ceo of Palantir knew Thiel well before 2003 when Thiel tapped him to be ceo. Karp has condemned “woke” ways of thinking, calling woke a central risk to Palantir, that Palantir is a counter-example to companies he considers woke. Karp condemned pro-Palestine protests calling them an infection inside of our society, he remarked the peace activists are war activists and they should be sent to North Korea. Karp has said the west has a superior way of living and said he supports Palantir contract with ICE and using the software to enable separation of families.

Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency were the key to creating the War Against Relaity that is described September 9, 2014 in public: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - of which we not know the IRA was online in 2013: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america
"Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года." Denial abounds, the USA and NATO have had their asses kicked in an information war, it is NOT ONLY the USA. "Putin is clearly winning Russia’s hybrid war against the U.S. because Americans don’t understand how they are being manipulated.

"Trump doesn’t have shit. The bottom line is that MAGA voters want a bad person to do the deplorable things they wish upon others but are too cowardly to execute themselves. So “liking” the guy is entirely beside the point.

Thats why creeps like Ted Cruz stay in power forever despite being utterly repulsive. It doesn’t matter. Being likeable doesn’t matter. Trump never needed to be likeable, he only needed to be ruthless.

Vance will have to prove himself to the same crowd. Is he willing to do what his voters won’t, to punish the people they hate? That is what matters.

At the end of the day, they’ll get behind Vance as long as he proves himself to be cruel enough to do the dirty work of America’s worst people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : An important concept to understand about fiction believers who are avoidant of nonfiction. Allah / God in The Bible is a horrible monster who kills everyone who disagrees with him (Noah's Ark)... yet people still praise and bow down to Allah / God. We do not teach this monomyth pattern in schools, we do not teach comparative mythology, **fiction exploitations of the human brain** for thousands of years... in our schools. Donald Trump is Mythological and frequently described as Jesus / God by Americans. The *attraciton to fiction* is a problem of Fox News HDTV fiction, Reddit messages fiction, Twitter fiction, Facebook fiction, Church fiction, etc. Parents indoctrinate their own children into these abusive fiction stories: “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

"They’re also sheep. Once Fox News starts saying he’s amazing for the economy and the second coming of Trump, then they’ll all line up to suck him off."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It is important to distingusih a cult of *messages*, of *fictoin storytelling cults*, from cult of individual people. L Ron Hubbard is dead, but his science fiction storytelling pattern can be reworked and adapted by leaders of Scientology fiction empire. Rupert Murdoch ficiton media empire is wealth televagelism networks. ===:::
