"To me one of the most chilling parts of 1984, and one that to me explains a lot of the conservative/authoritarian mindset, is when O'Brien explains to Smith that making someone else suffer is the only way to make sure you have power over them: after all, how can you know you are imposing your will on someone else if they just comply? For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them. That is the point of cruelty for its own sake as weaponized by conservatives ans authoritarians."

"Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers."](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america) - same goes for social media users. Get people addicted to fiction. This problem (crisis) is not in any way unique to the Republican party and United States of America - it is a human brain issue globally. Fiction outsells nonfiction.

― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ... alas, social meme addicts can't be bothered to stay focused on a printed book on paper and instead revel in the never-ending mockery of Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton. ===:::

"Honestly watching the fascist encounter with Hasan elucidated a lot to me. They literally do NOT care about any sense of rules being fair. They know what they want, they want to fuck over the people they despise, and they have zero problems creating laws that are 100% unfair and hypocritical. The expectation that laws should be fair is just not in their brain."

"His entire career should have been the end of any political aspirations. As difficult as it is, try to ignore everything political he has done and continues to do, including the Obama birther bullshit. Hell, try to ignore anything from this millennium and even the pedophilia. If ANYONE can honestly look at his pre-2000 career, his scandals/crimes, and his overall attitude towards anyone but himself, he’s still an absolutely awful candidate and just an awful person with zero connection to the working man. How the fuck is our president someone who I genuinely couldn’t vote for even when I ignore 95% of his scandals/stupidity?"

Compuslive addiction to hate / mockery / dehumanization of Americans. **Mocking MAGA is not resisting the Russian information warfare**, only teaching about information warfare itself and educating about cults is actually resisting.

"It's clear there has been a generational misunderstanding of what ‘conservatism’ is, and it’s because conservatives have been allowed to define themselves with this bait and switch where they have convinced people ‘real’ conservatism is about fiscal responsibility, constitutional reverence, free markets or ‘being cautious’. Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.

Conservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order**. That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.

They like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order. Once you understand this all their bullshit makes sense."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I like long-form Reddit comments with some thinking. Alas, it completely ignores that we are living in a society of insane antics, mass psychosis behaviors, cults, detachment from reality, crazy media addiction driven behaviors. Russia won an information war since March 2013, what psychologists from Cambridge Analytica did was wreck thinking and communications between people to a point that it has to be addressed directly. We have widespread brain damage now, and we need to rehabilitate our thinking. The Great Seal of the USA prescribes *non-instrumental reason thinking* of The Enlightenment project, not Levant thinking from 2,000 years ago about Allah and Yahweh. ===:::

OnDrugsTonight 2012-02-08 (declares self fromUnited Kingdom)

"I think you might be getting your hopes up a bit too much. American Fascism won't die with Trump. The same people who are killing America today will still have the same power structures in place; they still have tens of millions of people, including your MAGA neighbours, whose entire life is consumed by Trumpian cruelty and violence, and who wouldn't think twice about sending you to a death camp. Yes, some cults die with their founders, but this one is putting the structures into place at this very moment so that this doesn't happen. Scientology didn't die with Hubbard. The North Korean regime is flourishing as much as ever under its third Kim. Yes, Kim-Jong Un doesn't have the charisma or leadership skills that his grandfather and father had, but he doesn't have to - because Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il made sure to put the structures into place for their regime to go on indefinitely, or at least until they have killed every last North Korean citizen.

Right now Hegseth is replacing top generals with fascist leaders, right now the new ICE Gestapo is flush with $170 billion to put you under the yoke of the regime, right now troops are being moved into your cities, right now there are armed checkpoints in your nation's capital to control the movement of citizens, right now the media is being threatened into full government compliance, right now your elections are being rendered meaningless, right now the jackbooted thugs of the regime are doing raids of citizens' homes to put fear into them. All of that will continue and get worse whether Trump is there or not. If anything, the violence and the cruelty will get stepped up a notch upon his departure, while the new regime makes sure to maintain its stranglehold on the flimsy remains of American democracy.

The window of opportunity for fighting back is right now, and it's closing rapidly. There is zero chance that you will have meaningful midterm elections next year if you let this rotten filth fester any further, Trump or no Trump. There is zero chance that the bubble will burst on its own or that you get saved by a deus ex machina ending. Putting your hopes into the fact that Trump is a demented imbecile with rapidly declining health is a dangerous and ultimately fruitless gamble."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  The Twitter-think addiction to fiction isn't going away just because Donald Trump disappears. The aftermath of Cambridge Analytica psychologists isn't going away without being addressed directly. Goodness isn't going to randomly come up with a change of the season, people have to stop being addicted to enertainment trash and actually do thinking. Whcih at this point,everyone is flocking to artificial intelligence and people will fall for The ELIZA effect and believe nonsense is smarter. Nonsense fiction addiction already rules. I already know people are repulsed by my basic assertions that [democracy does not work without love and compassion being foundation - and MLK Jr's 1954 Equation](Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md). Alas, minds are so broken - asserting the most fundamental joys are important. Love is worth fighting for. **Hate is not worth fighting for and handing down hate to children**. ===:::

"Because their dictator will make the *others* suffer. They've been attacked for just being good god-fearing patriots, forced to be subjected to \*checks notes\* the WOKE liberals, and their "agendas".

I know for a fact if I were to post this one to Facebook, I'd probably have a couple of extended family members make disgusting comments on how funny it all is, even though back then they were bitching about Obama's Djion mustard, and whining about "Sleepy Joe Biden 😪".

"Americans will see shit like this, they will see these weirdos posing in family Christmas photos with AR-15s, they will see January 6th, and all of the violent rioters get a presidential pardon, they will see the president order active duty military into our streets, they will see Republicans erect a concentration camp and people posing beside an "Alligator Alcatraz" sign, and then call the Democratic Party radical and extreme.

The asymmetry in American politics is insane. Democrats are expected to behave like statesmen, and make no mistakes. Meanwhile, a crazy right-winger literally assassinated high-ranking Democrats in America this year. Another crazy right-winger shot up the CDC, and the president didn't even acknowledge either incident."
