"Trump will definitely blame Zelenskyy for this and say if Zelenskyy didn't start the war and just gave putin what he wants, that factory would not have been hit with a missile.

And then he'll blame the workers for being an easy target."

"For real tho. I had this account "permanently" suspended by the admin bots for "harassment", for simply commenting in a thread about applying kinetic force to the faces of modern adherents of the tenets of national socialism. By some miracle I was able to successfully appeal the suspension to a human being.

However, because of this "permanent suspension", all of my alts got suspended for being associated to this account. Again, for the sole reason of this false "harassment" suspension that an AI bot dreamed up.

On each of those accounts I filed an appeal after this account was restored. In each case the appeal was rejected, because they found I "violated the rules", with no further clarification.

Again, this was all because their killbot falsely suspended this one account for what appeared to be an AI hallucination. I had not logged into the alts in months, and did not log into them until after this account was restored and found them suspended for no reason except they were associated to this account via the IP address."

"Not everyone is mocking him is kind of a moot point. What matters is that a lot of people on the internet are, and he consistently gives an entertaining response. Like children, denizens of the internet see a response and keep poking.

(Which is good, in this case)"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Surkovian Russian information warfare is build upon a base of fatih in mocking. It's been TEN FUCKING YEARS of non-stop mocking and insulting Donald Trump as a terrible person. People in USA are so exploited in the brain to not recognize that Trump is playing Tony Clifton act with improv audience interaction. Mocking, hate, dehumanization magnet. The entire USA has adopated faith in hate and mocking. USA society is nothing at all like what it ws in year 2012 - every area of life has been consumed by this horribile faith in dehumanizing. Hate thy enemy nation. People love their social machines but huate human persons! Trump is a magnet for hate, Trump inspires hate. Peoople are media addicted to their machines delivering Trump hate messages, people will not face the media addiction itself and Russian media warfare that started in March 2013. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length tweet-thinking shallowness. This has been going on for TEN FUCKING YEARS. People in USA are acting like this just started in August 2025. Recency bias abounds. Just like Dr. Carl Jung said about **german people not realizing what was happening to them**: “The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.” - Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945 ===:::

"Why are people even still afraid of him?

He’s declined so much that if you look at him even just 2-3 years ago there’s a noticeable difference."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Let it be known world: This twitter-length tweet-think comment is shallow. Let it be known: People here in USA are not *afraid* of Donald J. Trump. What people can't tolerate in USA is boredom of Joe Biden and normal intelligent people. Study The Killing Fields in Cambodia 1975. People in USA are scared to death of not having nonstop amusement and entertainment. That is why they won't do the ONE THING that addresses Donald Trump Reality TV "The Apprentice" and Fox News - be serious and sustained about teaching media ecology. People here are so afraid of their own addiciton to television (Donald Trump is a total addict to media content), that they wont' discuss media warfare even from enemy nation Russia. [Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" explains Donald Trump and Putin's power over the population. Twitter thinking and meme addiciton to mockery and insulting, Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton is irresistable to chuckleheadn amused societ](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/). We here in USA have social media channel after social media feed streaming non-stop Trump hate content. Fox News is not "old with bad health", and people like the same fiction content bullshit addiction that you see with Donald Trump. Look at the other people like Elon Musk, they provide fiction Twitter content. We have a nassive media ecology crisis, addiction to fiction. Donald Trump is the ringleader of media addicts population. Joe Biden was "sleepy boring" to people, not entertaining. Jimmy Carter was not entertaining in 1979, people voted for entertainer Ronald Reagan - that is the topic of Neil Postmans' 1985 book (Reagan's second term in office, entertainment amusement addiction). ===:::

"Except Vance isn't taking "vacations". He's flying around and meeting with donors all over the nation and the world. He's *campaigning*! In each of his "vacations", hes meeted with various moneyed interests!

The US government legally can't pay for Vance to meet with his donors, but they can pay for his "vacation trips", hence why so many vacations! But Vance is doing some politicking on the side."

&nbsp;

RJ5R 2021-01-05

"Vance is making moves behind the scenes that neither you, nor I, nor even Trump are aware of. You think Peter Thiel is loyal to trump? Peter Thiel merely looked at Trump as a way to get Vance in..heck even Vance isn't loyal to trump he hated the guy right up until the moment Peter Thiel told him the plan. Trump doesn't even know what the heck is going on each day, he's already talking about if he will get into heaven, he's mixing up names, mixing up oceans, can't even remember countries, doesn't even remember what he says anymore. Peter Thiel is bankrolling the data mining for his companies, and allowing heritage to inject itself into every nook of government so they can execute P2025 to completion. While trump walks around pretending to be a president with sharpies and executive orders he is incapable of reading himself"

"Yeah, I agree. Vance is an opportunist. Most of the top MAGA seem stupid but Vance is smart. He couldn't have gotten this far without intelligence and patience. Out of all Trump's possible replacements, he scares me the most. Thankfully, he is not the most charismatic person. It seems really hard for him to hide his smug arrogance for long periods. 

I am surprised he hasn't tried to remove Trump from office yet. Maybe he doesn't have the backing to do it now. I think all the vacations are a way to distance himself from Trump."

"100%. Trump is the guy that is going to get as much as Project 2025 done. When he pops his clogs Vance will step in and Thiel will pull strings. So fucking sad what's happening over there. Gonna affect everyone on the planet. Would never consider visiting the States now."

"That's the really crazy part. He was a weak, pathetic pile of human-shaped garbage even in 2016, but at least his word vomit pretended to sound somewhat coherent, sometimes. While he was campaigning last year it was so obvious that he's in rapid cognitive decline. Even just comparing August 2024 Diaper Donnie to today's it's ridiculous how far he's degraded."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Look at the trash on every social media system. People flock to shit, people in USA are entirely addicted to what this Reddit user calls "word vomit", the more Donald Trump behaves like Tony Clifton, the more meme addicts (We The People, all inclusive) flock with their horrible taste in emdia consumption. Donald Trump provides endless stimulation to meme addicts who play crave any fiction story. People are compeletely repulsed by nonfiction authentic learning. People are addicted to the Kremlin War Against Realty / War Against Nonficiton that started March 2013. It is not just ONE MAN, Donald Trump, the trash media is all over Reddit and Fox News - and peple on social machines can't stop chanting "couhc couhc couhc" whenever JD Vance comes up, etc. It is the anti-intellectulism, the ficiton addiction, driving USA population. Surkov won, Russia won since 2013. ===::::

"That's funny because in describing some of his actual literal crimes, Reddit censors me. not even saying anything crazy, just literally stating fact and quoting him himself, is deemed inappropriate."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “The underlying ideology within social media is not to enhance choice or agency, but rather to narrow, filter, and reduce choice to benefit creators and advertisers. Social media herds the citizenry into surveilled spaces where the architects can track and classify them and use this understanding to influence their behavior. If democracy and capitalism are based on accessible information and free choice, what we are witnessing is their subversion from the inside.”
