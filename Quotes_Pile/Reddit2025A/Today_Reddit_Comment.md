"Ever notice how all these "I swear I'm not a Republican, I always try listening to both sides" celebrities only come out with these "we should support the president regardless of party" and "I'll pray for the president because if he succeeds, then our country succeeds" statements when a Republican is president? Funny coincidence."

"Read his excuse for supporting his cousin in law RFK Jr. Something like - he's a real good guy. We don't talk politics at family gatherings. Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?

Here's the thing Chris. Your Cousin has said vaccines are harmful. When confronted - he claims he said no such thing. Now, he's promoting anti vaxx policies. No need to trust the media or even talking to him."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?" -- which media? media ecology? Which date? Which idea? Where is your webspage showing where the media said fiction. Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Was it fan fiction about your movies? And you think media is the only creator of fiction. Name *one single person* in the entire world, of over 8 billion people, who is perfectly accurate and never ever confuses fiction with nonfiction? **PLEASE... name them, who is accurate and perfect in nonfiction**? Donald Trump can't tell fiction from nonfiction consistely does not comrpehend nonfiction. ===::::

"Considering he literally lived in a van on government assistance and has intimated many times that he prayed his way to success.

That means the "losers" aren't doing enough praying.

Is that about right?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We do not educate people in the most basic maths of popularity and counting. Exactly HOW MANY people can be household names? How many people can be famous stars (Chris Pratt)? How many people can have the lead role in a film? how many people can win the olympics? How many can win the FIFA World Cup? It is a maths issue. Every person who is injured in sports or missed a job interview (wihtout counting maths perspective) thinks that they would get the job, egoism. A lack of seeing the forest for the trees. How MANY bestselling books of the century can there be? How many number 1 songs can be number 1? How many books were written and thrown into the trash that were bestsellers because people were sick of audience / crowd reactions to books, you never KNOW! Just because something is *popular* (pop culture) doesn't mean it is an ideal.
People go through life thinking they should all marry the same spouse beacause they are the most beautiful ranked. So should Jennifer Lawrence have 8 million husbands? Taylor Swift have 8 million husbands? That's sometimes seems like who purchases the tickets! Since the comment mentions Jesus Christ prayer... The Bible, of 2000 yeas ago, has a math lesson: Matthew 25:40 - you can't all be NUMBER ONE, the 1 out of 100. You are supposed to pay attention to the most challenged persons, the "least of these" Matthew 25:40 ===::::

"Honestly, the whole 'You just hate this administration so much you'd say it was bad if they cured cancer' is such a fucking tired argument.

No amount of accomplishments will change the fact that those accomplishments were done with the dumbest motivation while also failing to address the root cause.

If you were firing a gun past my head recklessly and one shot hit a robber sneaking up on me, it doesn't change that you were toying with my life a moment ago."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : That's a good metaphor. That's what the Founding Fathers created the Great Seal of the United States of America artwork to teach! We are supposed to be the "new world order" of reason thinking (the 13th step up the Pyramid ‚ñ≤ of the Great Seal, equal in comprehsnion to Jesus and the 12 appostles in the Last Supper (13 level up ‚ñ≤ to the üëÅ eye) using a Levant storytelling metaphor). We The People are suppsoed to have mastered education and teaching to a point where DEMOCRACY is EVERY PERSON having the grasp and understanding from 1,700 year old Jesus storytelling and Hindu Upanishads and science reason thinking (the whole public linbrary)! We are ALL EQUAL as gods, and don't follow the motions of the planets like tea leaves readings ("old world order" before year 1776). We are supposed to think and have feedback and measuring systems of science to guide our paths, not just randomoly spray bullets and give prayer to halucinated god in thanks.

This is the awakening of man's reason. No longer is he informed and governed by the animal powers. No longer is he guided by the analogy of the planted earth, no longer by the courses of the planets -- but by reason."](../Joseph_Campbell_Metaphors.md) ===:::

"If you look at his weird public relationship with religion where he won‚Äôt take a stance on his own beliefs but yet, is super def religious, it sheds some light. Not sure we should listen to someone for any subject that cannot define and stand by his own beliefs. He is an actor. He just wants to please the next the person he talks to for his career and not offend anyone. Nothing super wrong with that until one protects fascism and spread anti-science misinformation which actually hurts people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Dear Chris Pratt - as a Christian, Bible follower, turn to verse "1 John 3:17" - you are to JUDGE Donald Trump, it is a judgement statement in verse "1 John 3:17" - that Donald Trump is without love with his material greed. Same judgement of Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch. And the IMPORTED Bible book is transted to Englsh and is not American / North American. Study the Navajo Pollen Path and other systems too. ===:::

Here it‚Äôs different because it‚Äôs public policy.

But yea I agree that I‚Äôm not that surprised."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : people who say statements like this are bewildered. Do you think The Bible is nonfiction? Do you think The Bible is the one and only one perfect book in the entire public library? It is a science fiction book. And if people can't comprehend and read a 2,000 YEAR OLD story properly. Regarding Chris Platt and Donald Trump, if he is so poor at literacy he can't find verse "1 John 3:17' in that 2,000 year old story - what luck do you think Chris Pratt has reading year 1776 Founding Fathers writings if he can't comprehend 2,000 year old Bible fiction? This is a LITERACY problem, not a FAITH or "BELIEF" problem. It is not good to let people run around with fundamental misundersanding and comrpehension failures and act like they aren't misinterpreting other books, users manuals, websites, literature, art work! Test Chris Plat on some song lyrics, what wild interpretations does he come up with if he can't see "1 John 3:17" applies to Donald Trump judgement by Bible fiction fans? WISE UP USA - we have hundreds of millions of people who can't tell Russian Internet memes are fiction. We have people who think Fox news is nonfiction! Addiction to fiction is driving the Donald Trump nation. the TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD Bible literacy is EVIDENCE of an absence of media ecology literacy (Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers level of multi-media literacy) ===:::

"Ah, the comment I was hoping to see!

If nobody said it, I was going to say the same thing. Been shopping at Target for about 20-25 years, they always seemed to be the high-end big box store with quality products. We all used to call them Targ√©t for a reason‚Ä¶they were the snooty upper class suburban option.

Lately‚Ä¶and by lately I mean over the last 5 years or so, they‚Äôve just been adding more junk. They‚Äôre still an option for standard commodity stuff like food, toiletries, books, toys that are identical to products you can buy elsewhere (although whether they‚Äôre cheaper is debatable‚Ä¶I usually have my Amazon app ready to price compare) but damn if their other products just don‚Äôt seem cheaper and more poorly made.

If it‚Äôs Target vs Walmart‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not seeing too much of a difference now. Except that Target is offering the same junk and higher prices and that won‚Äôt fly in this day of Trump-manufactured inflation"

"This headline is (a lot) misleading. Target has a policy that requires executives to step down at a certain age and this has been in the works for years. In fact, Brian Cornell was granted a few years extension on his contract.

He's leaving, but not because of declining sales, but because his contract ran out. I think Cornell made a bad decision in January to bend the knee. He did what he thought was right for shareholders, which is fine - I guess, but that decision had consequences that I don't think he anticipated or frankly cared too much about since he knew he was leaving later this year."

I'm emphasizing year 2014, year 2019, war against reality, war against nonfiction. And that was **BEFORE the late 2022 introduciton of ChatGPT / generative AI**. These have now converged. Billionare Putin was waging war against reality since the IRA spun up in March 2013 - and now with ChatGPT / GrokAI and other systems - all the billionares are funding machine-message anti-reality content!

"Twump is so obviously a person of poor moral character as the mountain of black marks against him clearly shows. He is a convicted felon and many of his associates and persons who came to know him well have spoken out regarding his lack of integrity and worse.

The Governor of California (who Twump calls Newscum) has thrown Twump's written hate speech vomit in his face by mocking his disgusting way of belittling anyone who does not offer him their obeisances or even questions anything he does or says. It is very amusing to see how his lackeys are reacting.

As someone watching the fracturing of the USA from the other side of the planet it sickens me that anyone can stand behind such a repulsive person.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Casting Donald Trump as a child constaly is Russian mind-fuck outcomes / Cambridge Analytica outcomes. A chld is innocent, not responsible for their actions. Statemens like "I call him Twump because I cannot call him by an adult name" - in other words, this person is describing compusive viewing Donald J. Trump, age 79, as a child in their mind. Because we do not have good models of educating adults. Trump is not being held accountable for inability to distinguish fiction from nonfiction, a very common adult education crisis in year 2025 - not just elderly like Trump - but adults age 23 to age 120. We NEED TO be teaching Neil Postman's body of work to help people recognize the timeline of where we went wrong - as Postman aws excellent at publishing to the general public as these media generation problems developed. As The Church was confronted with 1960's psychodelic rock music and 2001 Space Oddesy, the Church had a choice of marketing The Bible as *the best science fiction story from old times*, but instead they doubled-down and declared The Bible as nonfiction. This has wrecked many minds in society! This was a major mistake.
‚ÄúEducators may bring upon themselves unnecessary travail by taking a tactless and unjustifiable position about the relation between scientific and religious narratives. We see this, of course, in the conflict concerning creation science. Some educators representing, as they think, the conscience of science act much like those legislators who in 1925 prohibited by law the teaching of evolution in Tennessee. In that case, **anti-evolutionists were fearful that a scientific idea would undermine religious belief. Today, pro-evolutionists are fearful that a religious idea will undermine scientific belief. The former had insufficient confidence in religion; the latter insufficient confidence in science**.
