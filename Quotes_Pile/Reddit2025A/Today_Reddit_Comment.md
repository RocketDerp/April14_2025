"Land of the free, Home of the brave. The US is a fucking joke on the international stage both morally and politically."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : freedom to be addicted to Disney and Rupert Murdoch fiction media content. Freedom to hate. Freedom to dehumanize. Freedom to avoid nonfiction. Freedom to avoid science. Freedom to become cult addicts to one-line Twitter message length like this Reddit comment and not learn and study Neil Postamn's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", and instead use social machines to create tiny reaction commments and image animations every hour of every day for 10 years in service to Putina nd Trump information warfare. Freedom to Celebrate Ignorance on social media. ===:::

"Because its just justification for violence against the undesirables. Thats why they try and paint trans and other LGBT people as pedos all the time, and why the right pounces on any story of a immingrant/muslim/brown person being a pedo."

"And by a pedophile they mean your local harmless drag queen. I’m sure if a straight Christian man predated on a young girl he wouldn’t care as much"

"No one likes pedophiles, for a good reason. But a lot of people (conservative and wannabe "alpha" men) use them just to entertain their violent power fantasies about killing and mutilating someone. They don't actually give a shit about children being abused."

"Bingo and conveniently it's never their religious people or politicians it's their undesirables (people of the "wrong faith", color, orientation, wrong party, etc)"

"Conservatives don't believe in using words accurately.

When they say pedophile or groomer they're not talking about the youth pastor who got a 17 year old pregnant. They're talking about gay people being gay in public. 

There's a lot of focus on trans folks right now, but the conservative movement at large has never accepted any kind of LGBTQ+ lifestyle.

They're way more ok with a 25 year old dude getting a 15 year old girl pregnant because that's regular "normal" sex. As long as they get married, they might not have any problem with it at all. 

That sticker is just calling for the execution of gay people. It's not ironic, the words just mean different things to them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Conservatives do not grasp the John 1:1 *poetry and only poetry, words and only words* crisis. The Tower of Babel metaphor. Conservatives think fighting others with violence and hate over language and words (no outsiders who speak Spanish from Mexico, etc) is good, not comprehnding the meaning of the Tower of Babel lesosns to *transcend* the tower of langauges and memes. [James Joyce's year 1924 onward Finnegans Wake publication is essential for our highest educators and teachers to grasp in the modern media ecology systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV3vT5nW_I4) so they can teach the other teachers. It is likely not practical for every person to learn Finnegans Wake, but we can have a millions across the world who *teach the teachers*. ===:::

"Most of these bigots that ride around with these decals are individuals that think anyone in the LGBT space are groomers and pedophiles. They don't actually think trying to there is anything wrong going after 16 or 17 year old girls, at times younger.

You can see it with who their mouth pieces are and who their elected representatives are."

"People like this truck guy are the worst type of people. Because they trust the worst people that project their own qualities on their opposition and critics. There is a reason we have jury trials and do not just execute somebody based on an accusation, let alone some rumor."
