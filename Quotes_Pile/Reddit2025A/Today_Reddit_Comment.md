"Trump sees geopolitics as a group of personal relationships. China is just xi. Russia is just Putin. He can‚Äôt understand geopolitics and strategy.

Why is China doing this right now Donald? Why are they showing the world their military and cooperation? Hmm. Let‚Äôs think. Because it stands in stark contrast to you!"

"This very statement by Trump is meant to instill fear and a sense of isolation in Americans. Don't fall for it. Classic abuser behavior."

"China sells Trade, USA under Trump sells bullying and sanctions. It's not rocket science why this shift is happening"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length tiny short thinking, thought-terminating "not rcoket science". Out of millions of possible leaders for USA, why Donald Trump? People are completly ignoring the Russian media invasion since March 2013. The detachment from reality isn't just Donald Trump, is the population. Military loss of hearts and minds to self-harm USA and *hate harder* faith systems. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

"We're in the post-truth era. Facts and reality don't matter anymore, only what we wish to believe is true or feels good, fake news is whatever we wish to believe isn't true, and no one has time anymore to bother with fact checking. And it's only going to get worse with AI.

Welcome to the brave new world."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We are unwilling to face up that Torah / Bible / Quran are in their own special section and not moved to science fiction. Star Wars and Bible are both science fiction storytelling. Quran is a retcon of The Bible: Moses / Adam / Eve / Mary / Jesus / Noah are all in Mohammad's Quran some 600 years later. Book of Mormon year 1830 also a retcon of The Bible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon ===:::

"Since Trump tries to flood the zone with shit and divert media's attention to something else, this might be a good strat to keep the Epstein list in the news for longer period of time, in every news cycle."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Information Strip Tease. The cultivated QAnon / Q / Pizzagate audience is sitting and waiting on the fedreal goverment. Obdient media consumers. "Since Trump tries to flood the zone with shit", Netflix and HBO Max and Disney Plus do the same with *fiction shit*. So does the Church, which lead Europe for hundreds and hundreds of years using fiction. Surkov won, Russia won, since March 2013. ===:::

"My question is what happens when the names are out. Like let‚Äôs saw the names come out and we get someone like Trump front and center. Then what? Is anybody going to actually hold him accountable? Is he going to be removed from power?

Or is everyone just going to clutch their pearls and go ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs wild‚Äù while continuing to enable him?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People are attracted to the private jet lives of the rich and famous TV personalities / media stars. Supporting Malala with free time and spare time on social media addresses the underlying problem on a global basis of young girls being exploited by elderly men who bamboozle with fiction. Alas, social media users with spare time are far more attracted to the rich men's sex games and media content.

"I fucking hate that man"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : That's the very basis of Trump's power. Playng Tony Clifton gets this 5-word Twitter-length conditioned thinking, over and over. This has been ongoing for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, that social media addicts jump on their touchscreen machines to declare that Donald Trump is the power of hate. Organized hate media. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S8wllPmazM ===:::

"I will be handing out water bottles for people who get thirsty, and the people who can‚Äôt hold it anymore. They can pee and dump the filled bottle if need be. Seeing as it is a long line though, we do ask that people be quick and not use it as a chance to make tik toks and take selfies. Let‚Äôs not flood the internet with your personal ‚Äúpissed on his majesty ‚Äú videos. It‚Äôd be like filming fireworks. You just kinda had to be there."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media fantasy rituals centered around worshiping the Satan (South Park) / Devil Donald Trump character of Tony Clifton. Constant media stimulation by Trump to audience has been going on for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS. A society that has sold out all goodness so total mockery can be nonstop around Trump. ===:::

"It adds a really homoerotic tone to it all.

Like, I'm convinced that Trump sucks the dude's dick through a hole in the barrel after that."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Constant sexual fantasy and fetish of having the power and wealth of Donald Trump media star to perform sex domination with laws and the entire military of the United States of America backing you. Endless messages on social media about sexual power of Donald Trump, private jets, private islands, public pride in conqust. The USA population (We The People) can not get enough of Donald Trump sex, poop, body images and fantasy. This is a very sick, media addiciton, lost to Russia IRA media invasion, society. ===:::
