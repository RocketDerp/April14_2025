"We Should Put Our Phones Down’: Utah Governor Says ‘There Is a Tremendous Amount of Disinformation’ About Charlie Kirk Assassination"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Better headline focus of our amusement-driven entertainment-driven USA society of 2025: Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Charlie Kirk was providing fiction storytelling at the university to a crowd of over 3,000. And now fiction on the Internet about the killing / murder outsells nonfiction. ===:::

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

Did anybody ever listen to that? The shit he said behind the liberals backs to his buddies, like Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation?

Respectful would be tough to spin if they has a list of his biggest radio hits. My favorite was when he would call the opposition Demons.

His debate persona wasn't genuine. Nobody was going to 'change his mind'. He put on a mask so he could proselytize to a wider audience and lure in confused people with bullshit. Just a typical charlatan huckster."

"It really is. Been watching it happen here over the past two days.

Couple of the current lies are:

"He was murdered for his opinions!" Nope, that's absolutely not the reason why, is gross simplification, and a complete distortion of the truth, but it sounds really good for their side and makes him appear to be some kind of noble martyr.

And in response to his on the record quotes of it just being necessary for some people to die to gun violence: "That's not what he meant! He meant it was sad and unfortunate but couldn't be avoided! More people die in cars every year, should we ban all cars???" In addition to car and gun deaths being a nonsensical comparison between apples and potatoes, it's also a complete red herring meant to do nothing more than pull you away from the fact that he was an absolutely vile person that advocated for children to die to gun violence, as long as they weren't his children, of course, in order to stoke the support of right wing gun fetishists.

Just like all of his utterly fake "change my mind" debates, it has been crafted to push a narrative that to a noncritical thinker looks perfectly rational. But it's all fake, it's all a facade, it's all for show."

"Everyone seems to have forgotten quickly that when Trump was shot, they all rushed to say the shooter must have been a radical leftist liberal. Only that didn't turn out to be the case at all. If this Kirk shooter turns out to be MAGA, or comes from a MAGA family, then when do they realize the problem is not Democrats/liberals, it's the tone that has been set for several years now. Let's not forget that Trump has called for violence at his campaign rallies before when someone was protesting against him. He's often antagonistic, and pretty much a dick to any legitimate journalistic questions he doesn't like. This tough guy, mega-prick attitude sets the tone, and trickles down to all of his followers. It does not lead to positive outcomes."

"It’s truly insane that the President of the United States gave a speech stating, and I quote: “violence and murder are the consequences of demonizing those with whom you disagree with day after day, year after year…for years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis…this kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism we’re seeing in our country today…” BEFORE THE SHOOTER HAD EVEN BEEN CAUGHT. They just assumed it was someone on the left. Now to find out Tyler Robinson was not even registered to any political party and his personal beliefs are still unknown. Talk about division and demonization huh?"

"Yeah... We've even exerienced the whole "surely THIS blunder is the one that make them wake up".    
Right now I firmly believe that there is nothing in this world that can make these people realize the truth."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Mocking harder, hating harder, the MAGA Trump way. Trump always mocks harder, Trump always hates harder. Everyone is following the Trump lead on hate and mockery. In the Middle East, the fiction Quran addicts mock the fiction Torah addicts, and they mock each other back and forth over ficion storytelling is the one true perfect always-correct book from thousands of years ago. A total mockery values. ===:::

"The thing you've said about people falling silent and looking ashamed when you finally hit somewhere real in their brains is so true and familiar. They will never acknowledge it and move on straight in your face like it never happened as well. Your comment unlocked some old experiences that made me question reality at the time, and I had to confirm you are talking truth. Some people can't be reached. It's actually scary."

"and if he had been to a right-wing military school they would’ve said it was social media or censorship or some other bullshit.

the fact is that you have to look past the words these people use; the words don’t even matter to them. what matters to them is that you are always to blame, nothing will ever be enough, and they won’t stop until they have power over us.

nazis devised the global jewish conspiracy that went the same way. jews were always to blame somehow, some way. it didn’t matter who they were imor what they did. every foul thing was their fault somehow and it wasn’t ever about reality or fact or objectivity; it was about blaming jews and eventually killing then."
