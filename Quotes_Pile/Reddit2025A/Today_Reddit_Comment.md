"A Russian priest has been on a religious mission for years at an isolated mountain church.

He finally returns to Moscow, where he meets his friend at the bar.

"I just heard about the war, I can't believe it, we're fighting Ukraine and NATO?!?!" he asks his friend.

"Yes comrade, it's been a furious 3 day special operation that's lasted for years, we've lost 16 thousand armoured vehicles, a million soldiers, our Navy is defeated and over 1000 aircraft destroyed".

" my lord!" the priest retorts "and what about NATO?!".

"Oh, they haven't shown up yet"."

We are tricking, manipulating, informing each other into hate and dehumanization since year 2013 on a world wide web scale. And the entertainment industry, amusement mills of Bluesky and Reddit eat up every Putin and Trump / Kremlin and White House method of Surkovian governing since year 2013. We have drowned ourselves in bullshiting and insincerity. Our meme machines favor fiction and lies and deception and Russia has exploited that with Surkov students since March 2013.

"Almost feels like a South Park episode at this point."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Surkovian onion eating, completely unaware that Russian information warfare is based on absurd surreal South Park like mind attraction](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). Constant media entertainment being the Russian technique that has kept Putin in power for 25 years.

"Reality has been looking like a South Park episode for a while now, to be fair. Perhaps coincidentally ever since the White House became a bit more orange."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts to South Park, meme addicts to Bluesky and Reddit entertainment, can't get enough of the White House being run like South Park! The absurd surreal Surkov governing techniques of Russia year 2011 adopted to White House 2025. The most powerful way to captivate society into self-harm and detachment from science, detachment from goodness, detachment from reality - by constantly stimulating the audience into creating their own fan-fiction on social machines - mocking and insutling how terrible President Tony Clifton is at running Russia and USA. Compusive reactions to the President Clifton performance. People who make Twitter-length comments describing how President Tony Clifton is just like South Park, but are entirely unable to engage nonfiction books by Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev, Neil Postman and calll for defense against the Russian Internet Research Agency invasion of Reddit entertainment meme platform. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 Even when measles are killing people, the audience of Bluesky and Reddit think it is great funny entertainment "Leopards Ate My Children!! ha ha ha ha, ja ja ja ja Texas dumb-asses, stupid Americans" over and over every day. As condtioned by the Russian Internet Research Agency since March 2013 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 the constant amusement-washing satire-washing humor-washing of death by Russian information warfare that Reddit profits from and creates engaging memes about. South Park owners are making a tidy profit too! ===:::

"Sometimes I wonder if this is the plan. Letting russia drain itself against Ukraine until the people understand they are lied to and NATO isn't at fault for the Russian deaths, it's solely on Russian Militarism and expansion fantasies.

Then again NATO keeps talking about russia invading NATO in a year so I don't understand what is happening there at all."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The plan, as outlined by Surkov all along, is a war of All Against All (Surkov calls the 5th World War), peer to peer hate exchanges, the constantly entertained population on Reddit and other social media platforms wrecking the USA and goodness in humanity. In favor of addiction to fiction. Russia is self-harming itself with addiction to fiction monomyth self-own, the same anti-reality that Russia exports to others had brainrot Russia itself like Mecca fiction monomyth. Listen to Malala describing the fiction addictions of anti-science anti-goodness: “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

"I believe for the average people, all wars are pointless because they gain nothing from it.

You could make an argument for wars of independence or liberation, but through most of all history, it is only the rich and powerful ruling class that gain anything from war."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : War is being revived because it is so entertaining to people. Donald Trump is so incredibly entertaining to people as he plays President Tony Clifon. Putin and Trump have shown the desire people have for Hate Trump and Mockery Trump antics, insulting and saying how dumb stupid idiot President Tony Clifton is every free mintue and spare second on Bluesky and Reddit meme entertainment platforms. MAGA USA 2025 can't get enough of Fox News insulting and hating of poor, everyday people, in the wealth televagelism trickle-down messages. MAGA gets to call liberals retraded ("lib-tards"), and Reddit and Bluesky get to call Fox News addicts retarded dumb stupid people. It's a craving of every American to insult and mock and hate upon Americans. ... ... ...

"The US under our current leadership will not be aiding NATO."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The IRA working with CA has been so deep into minds, that Bluesky and Reddit addicts *aid Russia* at every chance. Promoting the idea that we should hate upon MAGA Americans, hate upon Southern USA and hate upon out-groups of every kind. People have adopted the out-group hate patterns Russia and CA created and internalized them since March 2013. Reddit and Bluesky can not engage **nonfiction pritned books** on the subject. For ELEVEN FULL YEARS books have sat rotting on the public library bookshelf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Is_True_and_Everything_Is_Possible on how Donald Trump antics / wild and crazy Truth Social works... and Reddit and Bluesky meme addicts have adopted the *hate harder, mock harder, double down on mocking* values of Donald J. Trump playing Tony Clifton. Russia won 100% of hearts and minds, people can not resist the Americans hate Americans patterns of mental conditioning that scientists created. All serious nonfiction evidence gets ignored, avoided by Reddit and Bluesky users. Even as children are injured and killed by measles. Active measures worked, Russia won, Surkov won. Reddit and Bluesky addicts constantly amusment-wash humor-wash Kremlin and White House techniques. Nonfiction avoided: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192  ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit and Bluesky media platforms are getting endless engagement off the video of a live broadcast murder / killing. The entertainment aspects of Donald Trump hate-based values are ever-expanding for OVER TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS. There is huge money and social power in the never-ending mocking and hating upon those lost to the Russian information warfare since March 2013. Media addicts, content addicts, low-effort comment creators on social platforms all over - can not get enough of this Americans hate Americans sports mentality that Russia seeded with the IRA. Absolutely no defense can get meme addicts to exit their stupor and addictions.

"The hypocrisy among the so called "free speech absolutists". They have had no issues mocking others suffering or death when it suits them in the end.

"my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act. Surkov himself is the ultimate expression of this psychology." ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, 2014

At every opportunity people in USA flock to Trump mocking and Trump hate with their spare time / free time on social machines, avodiing that Malala's messages are one click away on the same social machines. 4) Anti-goodness, against nonfiction about information warfare and resucing people from fiction meme addictions. 5) Anti-compassion / anti-emapthy, *fuck you* attitudes of *the others*.

"I think you’ve been honest because I know someone like this. He would openly tell you he used to be a republican… of the Nixon school! lol I held the laughter because Nixon is way before my time and aside from his impeachment I don’t know what he stood for. I encouraged the old man to let it all out.

Anyways he proclaimed he’s anti-everything, anti big government, anti religion specially, anti administrations and bureaucracy, anti establishment, an atheist, and one of the true libertarians. You can see how being a true hard core atheist he would have a problem with this Christian evangelical fanatism or fascism.

I found him slightly amusing in an “old man yells at clouds” kind of way. He is repulsed by MAGA, but too set in his ways to change parties I think. I cannot see him supporting social programs, though he benefits from them as he’s 82 and on Medicare, social security, etc. These people are sometimes quite contradictory. I think he’s one of those disaffected independents. Sometimes when I am puzzled by these kinds of voter I remember that old man.

Good on you for actually voting for the opposite party."
