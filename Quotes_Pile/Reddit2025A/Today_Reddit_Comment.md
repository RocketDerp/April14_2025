"Land of the free, Home of the brave. The US is a fucking joke on the international stage both morally and politically."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : freedom to be addicted to Disney and Rupert Murdoch fiction media content. Freedom to hate. Freedom to dehumanize. Freedom to avoid nonfiction. Freedom to avoid science. Freedom to become cult addicts to one-line Twitter message length like this Reddit comment and not learn and study Neil Postamn's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", and instead use social machines to create tiny reaction commments and image animations every hour of every day for 10 years in service to Putina nd Trump information warfare. Freedom to Celebrate Ignorance on social media. ===:::

"Because its just justification for violence against the undesirables. Thats why they try and paint trans and other LGBT people as pedos all the time, and why the right pounces on any story of a immingrant/muslim/brown person being a pedo."

"No one likes pedophiles, for a good reason. But a lot of people (conservative and wannabe "alpha" men) use them just to entertain their violent power fantasies about killing and mutilating someone. They don't actually give a shit about children being abused."
