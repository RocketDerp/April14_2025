They have no issue ordering people to comply with numerous rulings and ignoring their rights but when it comes to something that is actually a public good than it becomes evil.

Also, they downplay slavery in many respects, so their comparisons get weaker when they are also downplaying the worst things in history. I know there is a push to get rid of public education too but as a requirement to attend school, it does seem very legal. There is a clear public interest in vaccination on top of protecting the kids in the school system itself from needless illness and suffering."

"The biggest issue for Ukraine is still manpower and that's why a huge buildup of Russian troops is concerning.

Ukraine has taken extreme casualties throughout the war just as Russia has and the eastern front has been a giant hopelessly fortified meat grinder for 2 years now consuming tens of thousands on both sides.

Russia isn't doing well but they still have comparatively infinite manpower to draw on. Ukraine is literally running out of bodies to send to the front. Every man can only cover so much ground and the front is massive.

As your defenses are spread wider and wider your lines become thinner, your reinforcements less numerous, and the harder it becomes to move troops or equipment to problem areas.

If the Russians could get enough bodies together to make a truly large scale assault the entire Ukrainian line could collapse and that's more or less what Putin is hoping for, or if the number of troops is simply propaganda they're hoping to intimidate the Ukrainians into coming to the negotiating table before that hypothetical collapse could happen."
