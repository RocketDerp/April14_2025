"Within a week or so of Donnie meeting with Putin so he can be told what Vlad expects from him, Russia did a massive missile strike on Kyiv and killed more than a dozen people and wounded hundreds.

Civilians. That is what Russia attacks with their missiles. They do not use their missiles against the Ukrainian troops slaughtering their own soldiers, with a casualty ratio of 4:1 in favor of the Ukrainian defenders.

Why is Russia fighting this way? Because they intend to simply destroy Ukraine on all fronts until it collapses. This is known.

"If you watch the video, it is a specific term. It is understood by Russia's neighbors all too well. It is the name for Russian imperial delusions.

"Russism" is the belief that Russia is the center of a genuine historically real empire, that includes the Baltic states, ceretainly all of Eastern Europe, but historically Ukraine has been the chief prize of Russist fantasies. Ukraine, is Russia, according to Russism.

It's this idea of a "Greater Russia" which includes, btw, Alaska. It's a delusion. But that video is from 1995, the Yeltsin years. 30 years ago, people who were soon to be assassinated (Dudayev was assassinated shortly after this video, and Chechnya is now a Russian vassal) told us what we are facing today."

"Also Maga IS Trump. A cult rarely ever survives after the leader dies. Heck one cult survived only because the newest leader pretended that the original leader was just in some kind of spiritual sleep and would return, and even then they still didn't last that long.

Many have tried to be the new Trump and has fallen flat. I honestly don't know what it is, I personally find him about as appealing as a hangnail. But some people find him charismatic, and that's like the main weapon of a cult leader.

JD Vance is already disliked by many even in the Maga verse, with some already calling for Rubio to take over instead of Vance. His level of weird awkwardness, is close to that of Ron DeSantis.

Plus some will just be too depressed after. It's gonna happen and I'm genuinely worried about the rise in rates of self exits that might happen.

I recently saw a video of a woman recording her dad where she faked reading an article that Trump died and his reaction was on the same level as if someone told him someone killed his own mother.

Maga is at a level of worship that is scary and not for those on the outside."

"I am also genuinely worried about the rise of self-exits after MAGA realizes they have been lied to and taken for suckers... after they already lost their entire family, probably all of their non-like-minded friends, support group(s), and substantial amounts of money, whether via donations or merch. They gave up their entire lives... their life savings... their families, even their own children, for THIS?

Edit: There will probably also be a new flavor of scam for those who have no desire to self-exit; maybe they will promise to help you get your family and/or money back. They are still gullible and easily led after all, that part wouldn't change..."

"My biggest worry is for farmers. They already have a higher than average self exit rate.

"The National Rural Health Association reports that farmers are 3.5 times more likely to die by s****e than the general population."

And they're more common to be family annihilators, so not only would they take themselves out, but there is the potential of them taking their whole family with them.
