"A Russian priest has been on a religious mission for years at an isolated mountain church.

He finally returns to Moscow, where he meets his friend at the bar.

"I just heard about the war, I can't believe it, we're fighting Ukraine and NATO?!?!" he asks his friend.

"Yes comrade, it's been a furious 3 day special operation that's lasted for years, we've lost 16 thousand armoured vehicles, a million soldiers, our Navy is defeated and over 1000 aircraft destroyed".

" my lord!" the priest retorts "and what about NATO?!".

"Oh, they haven't shown up yet"."

We are tricking, manipulating, informing each other into hate and dehumanization since year 2013 on a world wide web scale. And the entertainment industry, amusement mills of Bluesky and Reddit eat up every Putin and Trump / Kremlin and White House method of Surkovian governing since year 2013. We have drowned ourselves in bullshiting and insincerity. Our meme machines favor fiction and lies and deception and Russia has exploited that with Surkov students since March 2013.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Surkovian onion eating, completely unaware that Russian information warfare is based on absurd surreal South Park like mind attraction](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). Constant media entertainment being the Russian technique that has kept Putin in power for 25 years.

At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: **“We all know there will be no real politics,”** he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. **They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”**

"Reality has been looking like a South Park episode for a while now, to be fair. Perhaps coincidentally ever since the White House became a bit more orange."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts to South Park, meme addicts to Bluesky and Reddit entertainment, can't get enough of the White House being run like South Park! The absurd surreal Surkov governing techniques of Russia year 2011 adopted to White House 2025. The most powerful way to captivate society into self-harm and detachment from science, detachment from goodness, detachment from reality - by constantly stimulating the audience into creating their own fan-fiction on social machines - mocking and insutling how terrible President Tony Clifton is at running Russia and USA. Compusive reactions to the President Clifton performance. People who make Twitter-length comments describing how President Tony Clifton is just like South Park, but are entirely unable to engage nonfiction books by Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev, Neil Postman and calll for defense against the Russian Internet Research Agency invasion of Reddit entertainment meme platform. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 Even when measles are killing people, the audience of Bluesky and Reddit think it is great funny entertainment "Leopards Ate My Children!! ha ha ha ha, ja ja ja ja Texas dumb-asses, stupid Americans" over and over every day. As condtioned by the Russian Internet Research Agency since March 2013 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 the constant amusement-washing satire-washing humor-washing of death by Russian information warfare that Reddit profits from and creates engaging memes about.

"Sometimes I wonder if this is the plan. Letting russia drain itself against Ukraine until the people understand they are lied to and NATO isn't at fault for the Russian deaths, it's solely on Russian Militarism and expansion fantasies.

Then again NATO keeps talking about russia invading NATO in a year so I don't understand what is happening there at all."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The plan, as outlined by Surkov all along, is a war of All Against All (Surkov calls the 5th World War), peer to peer hate exchanges, the constantly entertained population on Reddit and other social media platforms wrecking the USA and goodness in humanity. In favor of addiction to fiction. Russia is self-harming itself with addiction to fiction monomyth self-own, the same anti-reality that Russia exports to others had brainrot Russia itself like Mecca fiction monomyth.

"I believe for the average people, all wars are pointless because they gain nothing from it.

You could make an argument for wars of independence or liberation, but through most of all history, it is only the rich and powerful ruling class that gain anything from war."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : War is being revived because it is so entertaining to people. Donald Trump is so incredibly entertaining to people as he plays President Tony Clifon. Putin and Trump have shown the desire people have for Hate Trump and Mockery Trump antics, insulting and saying how dumb stupid idiot President Tony Clifton is every free mintue and spare second on Bluesky and Reddit meme entertainment platforms. MAGA USA 2025 can't get enough of Fox News insulting and hating of poor, everyday people, in the wealth televagelism trickle-down messages.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Sunday morning on Reddit, church lessons, USA church technique of *shame them*. Attitudes of: It's perfectly OK to have hate mindsets in people, but I want to be able to block them on social machines so I don't have to hear their specific flavor / brand of hate. Nothing will ever go wrong that I have accepted hate in every day of my life, I just don't want this one Germany hate system to be able to speak or communicate. A filter-bubble of egoism that hate is perfectly fine in the world as long as it is my kind of anti-humanism hate. That's the Reddit messaging of machine lust / worship of technology Reddit machines, to block and silence out the Nazi messages but perfectly fine with Reddit hate of some other kind - as long as it isn't Germany organized hate groups from "over there". Hate of Fox News vs. Bluesky and Reddit vs. Facebook is welcome on Reddit, but not the Germany hate system of Nazi messages. Shallow and superficial egomania culture of worship hate, just particular which choices are made from the buffet of hate subreddits. "nazis need to be shamed to hiding again" - the only goal is that they are hidden from sight / hidden and underground, like secret Islamic terrorists, in hiding. The message is: set a very low low low measuring bar of progress and reform. Don't listen to Malala and address the problems. Don't listen to MLK Jr and address the problems as a global issue. Just focus on the ones you don't personally find attractive. Short tiny Twitter-think logic about Russian information warfare.

"It's actually well established, even by the FBI:

Russian influence enabled the extreme media coverage (making things seem worse, etc.) that is now being used by US media as it has been shown to work for ads, etc. so the Russian seeds have worked.

There was real evidence for influence in 2016:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials_and_spies

"The FBI's work was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who led a special counsel investigation until March 2019.[8] Mueller concluded that Russian interference was "sweeping and systematic" and "violated U.S. criminal law", and he indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations."

"This is what a lot of people don't realize. These countries (much like our own) have entire teams/programs dedicated to Psychological Operations. They study and have plenty of data on what is considered contentious subjects. Race, political affiliations all these things just waiting to be exploited. 

And those that fall into these false narritives about race and political identities becoming part of you own personal identity... You are playing right into the hands of foreign adversaries.

Furthermore, particularly on the political front... Politicians are not representing you - left or right - they are representing their own monetary interests. Do you know of a congressperson or someone who has been president thats not a multimillionaire? So tread with caution before you start fighting IRL or virtually online for any higher office people. Look at their actions, not their words and be smart. Don't fall into herd mentality. It's a trap no matter what side you are on.

"Europe has failed to realise fascism wasn't a fad of the nazis it's a human quality.

Oldest I can find of violent authritarianism through establishment of an underclass whose purpose is to be lesser and persecuted is ancient Sumeria who hated women. The Romans did it, the Catholic church did it, the British did it and the Nazis did it. This isn't new.

Yet we have sat here and allowed fascists to incite hatred and develop a platform despite the fact that these people are the most deadly issue humanity has ever faced bar literal disease.

This is a fundamental failure of democracy and is tantamount to institutional suicide. Fascists should be stripped of their media presences and their vote because 70% of the population shouldn't be persecuted and executed because 30% is hateful and insane.

Keir Starmer and populist panderers have fundamentally failed as human beings. These fascists will kill anyone who stands against them if it is "acceptable" and so we must prevent their interference at all costs. No rights beneath my rights."

All with stairs, no walk-in showers. Slowly they each are losing their ability to drive. Speaking of driving, when a bad winter hits, they all find themselves trapped for days. And they're all sort of trapped because they all moved here 40 years ago when they were young and they all have 40 years of "furnishings" and "antiques" to prove it.

"Quite literally. The middle class was a marketing exercise to stop the working classes doing what they did in the soviet union, which they were very close to after ww2. The enlightened among the wealthy realized they couldn't resort to the brutal tactics they had previously relied on to suppress what was now a trained fighting force, united, and willing to die. And the soviet unoin would rapidly back any successful working class movements in the west. It was a dangerous time to be as greedy as they had always been, so they gave a little back, to convince the working classes, there was actually a model of capitalism which benefited them.

Now they have completely destroyed working class cohension, the soviet union, and divided the population into a million factions fighting over absolute nonsense, rather than their common interests, they are rolling things back to how they always were, maximum work in exchange for the literal minimum necessary to keep you alive to come back to work."
