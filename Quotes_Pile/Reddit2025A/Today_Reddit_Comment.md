"I reckon they will settle into a state where the conservative talking heads will be the face of the administration. They're the ones with the support, and they'll carry water for whatever agenda the Whitehouse pushes.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People in USA go along with 'talking heads', the media content, on critical health care insurance / measles and other diseases. This is an abandonment of science in favor of fiction media network addictions. Media of mocking and insulting the out-groups is driving behaviors. Reddit and Bluskey addicts mock away at hundreds of millions / MAGA population, not just one man Trump. ===:::
