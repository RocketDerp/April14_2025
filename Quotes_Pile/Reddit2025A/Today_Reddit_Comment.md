"This is Reddit. We don't do sources here."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Was one of the big changes in Reddit long-form comment culture when the Putin media invasion started in year 2013. People became far more concerned about insulting and mocking other people than educating and teaching - providing links and citations - that the Google search engine could hit upon topics and keywords. Even if the person you were directly replying to in public discourse didn't care about the link, 7 years later on Reddit a search engine hit could bring people to the old conversation. That media ecology self-awareness started to boil off in the out-group hate heat the IRA induced. ===:::

"Me too. Damn that’s sad I had to learn from a meme."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction content consumers get incredibly sad when a very old man, age 89, dies. A person they do not know except through film and television content. The same younger film media / movie media fiction addicts (Robert Redford context) **can not relate how fiction addicts to Charlie Kirk content (podcasts) being killed shockingly in public while speaking at a University has induced media mania in audience members**. There is a complete lack of comprehension of media ecology and how emotion (["heart strings" metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s)) are pulled and manipulated by wealth content holders / copyright holders. And who pulls such heart strings. The film industry cartels / musi industry cartels / video game characer cartels / who manipulate audiences to build massive wealth / social emdia fiction content cartels (Reddit, Facebook, Elon Musk Twitter) do it even mroe personalized since year 2013 using Cambridge Analtyica and Kremlin techniques.

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?”

"The Russians could disappear into thin air and it would probably still take months for Ukraine to recapture the country.

Millions of landmines, anti-personnel traps, ditches, trenches, nets, tank traps, razor wire, poisoned wells, booby trapped houses and dugouts, caltrops, and many other horrible things stand between Ukraine and any hope of normalcy.

Dealing with those things will last decades after the last Russian gets turned into fertilizer."

"I agree, the headline is certainly a bit extreme.

To be as generous as possible to it, what I would say is that, on a larger scheme, the Russian offensive to take Pokrovsk has largely culminated. The disaster for Russia that was the “breakthrough” from a few weeks ago north of the city has really resulted in a major kneecapping of the already weakening push.

When you add to that Ukraine’s effective striking at logistics and assets that were recently diverted to the Pokrovsk offensive, it really points to the fact Russia is in trouble.

That also ignores the trouble brewing in the Sumy region for Russia as well with Ukraine now making flanking strikes into Russia itself at this point. Normally you’d think such a situation would warrant more assets, but we’re hearing that Russia is sending troops AWAY from Sumy and towards supporting the Pokrovsk offensive.

I think soon enough we may see the first month of more Ukrainian gains than Russian gains in a long time, and it won’t be due to a sudden massive rout. Ukraine is learning how to effectively clear out Russians, and Russia is rapidly losing the ability to maneuver cleanly and safely with the amount of armor lost."

"This has nothing to do with sanctions. Sanctions are showing their effect, but elsewhere.

This is caused by Russians overextending in a thin strip of land surrounded by Ukrainian forces on all sides, betting they won’t have the manpower to counter attack, somehow forgetting this is the most densely manned part of the front."

The absurd surreal Surkov governing techniques of Russia year 2011 adopted to White House 2025. The most powerful way to captivate society into self-harm and detachment from science, detachment from goodness, detachment from reality - by constantly stimulating the audience into creating their own fan-fiction on social machines - mocking and insutling how terrible President Tony Clifton is at running Russia and USA. Compusive reactions to the President Clifton performance.

Then again NATO keeps talking about russia invading NATO in a year so I don't understand what is happening there at all."

"my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act. Surkov himself is the ultimate expression of this psychology." ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, 2014

Anyways he proclaimed he’s anti-everything, anti big government, anti religion specially, anti administrations and bureaucracy, anti establishment, an atheist, and one of the true libertarians. You can see how being a true hard core atheist he would have a problem with this Christian evangelical fanatism or fascism.

I found him slightly amusing in an “old man yells at clouds” kind of way. He is repulsed by MAGA, but too set in his ways to change parties I think. I cannot see him supporting social programs, though he benefits from them as he’s 82 and on Medicare, social security, etc. These people are sometimes quite contradictory. I think he’s one of those disaffected independents. Sometimes when I am puzzled by these kinds of voter I remember that old man.

He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: **“We all know there will be no real politics,”** he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. **They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”**

Kirk didn’t deserve to die, but he was a lying grifter that spread hate whenever possible and now his death is being used to spread more hate.

I’m not surprised that this administration is lying about Kirk’s death to spread their agenda, but it’s deeply disturbing that they’re spreading such thinly veiled calls for war against Democrats simply because they’re questioning Kirk’s own highly problematic statements. True leaders would seek to lower the temperature and find a middle ground. Power hungry leaders force division and attack their enemies while pretending they’re the victims."

"I’d argue it’s a little more complicated than that. Part of it is targeting college-aged kids to focus on the next generation of Republicans (a scary thought), but it’s also eroding public trust in higher education. Republicans are pushing the idea that colleges indoctrinate students into believing liberal ideas, so having someone “debate” college students makes Republicans believe that colleges students aren’t actually smart and college is failing to teach students real facts. The truth is educated people are more likely to lean left because college teaches students to think reasonably and better distinguish between fact and fiction. It also helps that college forces students to experience new cultures and lifestyles that they might never have seen before. I grew up conservative but became more liberal after having black, gay, and Indian roommates in college that helped me realize my small town wasn’t the entire world."

"Thank you Amanda! He spent his career being hateful toward large groups of people and constantly spewing divisive rhetoric and now his fans are demanding everyone universally mourn him. If you liked him whatever you’re entitled to feel sad but obviously not everyone is a fan and shares that opinion. It’s insane. And frightening, I feel like I’ve never seen anything like what’s happening here with this crackdown. It’s now evolved to attacking brands that haven’t said anything at all and snitching on private businesses whose flags aren’t at half mast. They’re trying to force us into compliance."

"Why do people keep repeating this? No, it's not bullshit and distraction, these are coordinated attacks on multiple fronts. Stop underestimating their plans. Too many people think that anything that they do is to cover up the Epstein files. You know what would happen if the files are released and it is proven that Trump was there, even if there is enough to show he is a rapist? Nothing! There is already proof that he is a rapist and nothing changed."

"I just don’t know if my brain can even wrap around how we literally got here. We have a guy that stands up and says, “ignore the evidence of your eyes and ears, only what I am saying right now is true and real. Any evidence that you see or hear that contradicts what I am saying right now is false and planted by not just my enemies, but your enemies as well. They want to destroy you, unlike me, who is just like you in every way even though our lives and experiences and wealth and opportunities are completely different. The systemic changes that I have made to impact the country financially are actually helping you and the evidence of your own wallet is wrong because if Kamala had been elected she would have made it worse. My many and varied crimes and money making schemes are actually all for you. I have not benefited at all despite my worth going up by more than you and your whole family tree can make in their lifetime. “ How are there people that love being lied to so much and so consistently?"

"At some point, one has to face that the Epstein stuff IS THE DISTRACTION while they implement a fascist Christian Nationalist state that purges all the undesirables. None of the Epstein collaborators and clients will ever face justice, but they will use it to pacify people while they make the country into a hellhole we can't get out of."

"I’ll take it one step further: the right seems to be REALLY upset that the left has created their own narrative on the shooter. Now, whether that’s true or not, the irony of that being a complaint of theirs after alllll their alternative spin bullshit on Jan 6, Obama’s Birth Certificate, Covid, School shootings, and basically everything they do, is strait up bananas.

This country is a spinning top at the tail end of its run where it’s more wobble than spin."

"Who are so dumb that they think alienating / trying to destroy over 50% of the country is 1) smart or 2) feasible. Like dude, imagine you are the coach of a football team and you tell the team you hate the defense. That's a sure fire way to win the superbowl."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Surkovian onion eating, completely unaware that Russian information warfare is all about feeding media addictions (this Reddit user shows zero self-awareness their own comments are predictable dumb-calling other Americans / condtioned by IRA) to self-harm the nation because people would rather die for fiction storytelling than nonfiction all coming together - fighting back against Russia since year 2013](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). People think this all just came up this month with Charlie Kirk and can not egage nonfiction learning from year 2014 about the messaging warfare, content warfare, the war against nonfiction. "imagine you are the coach of a football team and you tell the team you hate the defense. That's a sure fire way to win the superbowl." - just oblivious to military conepts. Imagine Russia getting the most powerful NATO nation to self-harm and attack Canada and attack Greenland and meet Putin in Alaska and other self-harm choices! That's what IRA and CA payloads do to people, self-harm. Similar to suicide by cop, suicide by Reddit and sucide by Bluesky and sucide by Charlie Kirk content podcast addictions! Death by fiction addiction, self-destruction by being unable to escape predictable hate reactions and see the Russian instegator! ===:::

"Exactly. They have been setting themselves up (some) militarily/national guard /border patrol and pulling in members of any state group that will sign up to empower them to get rid of immigrants. The amount of people they are weaponizing is huge. Maybe they will just pick up garbage or maybe we’re watching a real time build up against citizens to change over to the technofascists network state plan. Is certainly foreboding."

"Yeah. Same here. A meme on the internet is how we get this news now. I think it's time to rewatch "All the President's Men" tonight out respect for a great Actor/Director we've just lost, and for the hard-hitting investigative journalism that died long ago."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "A meme on the internet is how we get this news now." - did they expect a personal phone call from a person they never met in person in their lifetime? The police should visit their front door and knock to tell them a very old man, Robert, died at 89 years old. When the average life expenctacy of a male in the USA is under age 79 (age of Donald Trump) by some estimates. A man who lived 10 years past other people, needs a door knock notification visit? (I wish I was half joking about this relationship people have with acting stars like "Robert" (title of the Reddit posting) and Donald and other old men who die of old-men related disorders, the shock Reddit society people have). ===:::
