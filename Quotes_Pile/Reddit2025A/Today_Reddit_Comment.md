"Good god. If there are Americans who still are not ashamed of this shitclown, then the country truly is lost."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addiction rules the USA population. We The People can not resist mocking and insulting Tony Clifton acts of the Trump White House. Endless mockery and name-claling ("shitclown') for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS. Amusement entertainment addiction, media machine addiciton to endless streaming antics. ===:::

"Lmao how is he president"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : LOL LOL LOL meme-speak amused Twiter-thinking 5-word comment messages all over every media system. Social media laugh-track messaging. How is Donald Trump President and ruler of all society media systems behaviors for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS?

They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

"The "you" she is talking to is Democrats and D voters ... and that's what Trump is doing ... and that's why Republicans and MAGA love it and are foaming at the mouth for fascism."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We the people are "foaming at the mouth" for nonstop mocking and insulting. Donald Trump playing acting the Tony Clifton performances (now augmented with others) is Surkov governing techniques of Russia year 2011. People are meme-addeled, drunk on trash mockery of Donald Trump, minds blown by the never-ending total mockery that Putin and Trump create. We The People are uanble to exit the meme stupors and face up that absurd surreal comedy, mind-blowing antics amsuement, are the foundation of Trumpism / MAGA mental exploits. Social machine addicts are **foaming at the mouth** over "karens" and images every day, Putin and Trump have mastered this as a form of governing.
"Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics." - December 31, 2014. BBC, Adam Curtis ===:::

"You could do a whole psychology degree on if Trump is immoral or amoral."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : One person could get an education degree. The problem is the entire population age 12 to age 120, but fixation on only Donald Trump as status symbol and icon of society has everyone adopt Trumpism egoism. The addiction to fiction, the avoidance of nonfiction, explains MAGA / Trump / USA September 2025. In fiction, you can be immoral and amoral both - just like the Middle East values fiction above all else (Scince fiction stories of Torah / Quran / Bible). ===:::

"only idiots pretended like these types of warnings were overblown or exaggerated. same idiots keep reporting on what’s going on daily like it’s not the most insane shit."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction addicts are not *pretending* they are addicted to fiction storytelling. Go live and study the Middle East and North Africa like I did during the Arab Sprirng with an eye on media ecology. It isn't pretending! Russian people who believe Putin are not pretending the past 25 years with Surkov fiction-based governing systems. ===:::

"That’s not a “gotcha.” They lied. They know. Their voters know. We know. Lying is the point — they want to downplay it. They will deny reality to downplay it.

The reality is that at best they are creating a two-tier society where all non-whites are subject to scrutiny about their legal status at any time. Employing a non-white will carry risk of disruption and loss of revenue to your business because they will be taken and interrogated for days without notice."

"Oh definitely! That’s definitely a problem! Disenfranchising voters and making it so basically their votes don’t count is very valid.

Hey, I dunno what the downvotes are for. I’m just trying to make this an actual conversation instead of whining, name calling and finger pointing. When we talk about things rationally, we might actually come up with some solutions."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This long-time Reddit user (account created in year 2012 election) finds their message is being supressed by Reddit media systems. They know to call this out in public, not brush it under the rug. Political discourse on authentic nonficiton topics is a target. ===:::

"There no downside to this game of Chicken. When one side uses a destructive tactic, the other side refusing to use it actually makes the initial use more bearable. If both sides use it, blame is directed st the first party to initiate (if the second party don't fall for the inevitable bait) and the tactic becomes percieved as unsustainable leading to bipartisan reform.

If the second party doesn't use us, the first party will deny it's disruption, claim it's not a problem, and the only side trying to eliminate it as a tactic is the side not benefitting from it.

We need to think of the government the same way we think of driving: It's better to act predictsbly than to act polite. If somebody gerrymanders, you gerrymander back to demonstrate live why it's an unsustainable disenfranchising tactic so we can end it. If somebody shuts down the government, you shut it down back for the same reason. If somebody weaponizes the DoJs you do the same. Don't act nice. act predictably, and more and more problems will be resolved."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit messages saying it is better to act predictably Russian, pro-Putin, as long as it is predictable. Better to be a driver who runs over every child, hits every other car, because that's what is expected in a smash-up-derby. Entirely avoiding the Russian information warfare and anti-reality mental states that abound since the Kremlins started the War Against Reality (on Reddit inclusive) since March 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ...

Remember that the news media has protection in the constitution?

How about demonstrating why.

Yes, stop acting like this is normal.

Or it will become normal."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media **amusement-washes Trumpism / MAGA. Endless humor-washing of Trump.** Ha ha ha, LOL LOL amsuement mills - Bluesky / Reddit / Twitter / Facebook.

Just as Neil Postman described about Ronald Reagan's second term in office in 1985 about entertainner leadership. Sickening how easily people will sell out goodness for surrael absurd Tony Clifton entertainment by Trump and supporters. https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley  ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Eating the Surkovian onions. Believing that Surkov media techniques that have kept Putin in power for 25 years are "accidental"](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). That Trump is clueless about how to draw crowds and exploit human brains with poularity. "Fucking embarrassing and infuriating" is exactly the mechanics of Kremlin information warfare. Denial abounds. Reddit users just can not imagine that surreal absurd Tony Clifton acntics are military weaponzied techniques of Putin. ===:::

Just like living in an Islamic nation and every mosque on every corner teaches Mohammad's Quran story. They believe what they are handed as appealing fiction storytelling.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Quran is science fiction storytelling. Trying to cram everyhing into left vs. right is a modern media behavior. Peole who believe ficiton as raality are a concern, unable to distinguish factual reality about the world. Believing Star Wars and Bible science fiction are factual. Teaching comparative mythology and media ecology subjects is not optional. ===:::

"Too many people weren't paying attention.

Too many people believed the lies he was telling, or at least gave them far more weight than they'd proved deserving of.

Too many people ignored the warnings, acted like Democrats and others were just being hyperbolic or sensational, "crying wolf" etc.

Trump is the culmination of long-standing Republican efforts to drag discourse into the mud, to turn everything into a politicized mess, so they can say or do anything and people will just make it into an equal issue, no matter how bad/awful/criminal/horrific the Republican position is."

"That's what is so bewildering about conservatives in general - they are on the wrong side of every single issue, almost reflexively. They have developed such a hatred of empathy and education that they now just take whatever the wrong position is and stay there to spite the other side. Vaccines? Equal rights? Climate change?

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Sports game addict, video game speedrunner addicts, people who abandon reality in favor of fiction storytelling of sports game concern / famous Donald Trump Reality TV "The Apprentice" concern. No other leader can provide the fiction storytelling like Donald Trump to meme addict society. Middle East / Levant values of Torah fiction / Quan fiction / Bible fiction. People die for their favorite fiction storytelling. Fox News fiction is thrilling and exciting like sports coverge, not boring like learning nonfiction. ===:::

"His cult doesnt care. They just deny reality as usual. Or say things like "prices are in line for this time last year....this is normal". Meanwhile less than a year ago they couldn't stop crying and whining about the price of bacon eggs and gas. The maga cult does not care that trump costs them more money. Trump being "better" for the economy and their wallets was just an excuse they used to support a lying felon billionare pedophile. They said it was for money instead of the truth. They support him bc he hates and attacks the same people they hate. Its as simple as that"
