"This is just plain false. This is absolutely being covered by major western media networks.

The people who complain about something "not being covered by western media" are usually the ones who don't even watch the news or read online newspapers. Often, they only get their news from Reddit or other social media, so when something isn't on the front page of Reddit or being spammed on Twitter, they think nobody else is covering it."

"you guys are stupid if you think the United States has any control over what Israel does. The relationship does not work like that, Israel doesn't know whatever it wants with American tax payer money. Then uses the United States to clean it up"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Israel and USA population consumes the same science fiction story "Torah" with Adam / Eve / Moses (Bible front section, "Old Testiment" in the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible) and think they have common values and grounds. It is like the audience of fiction Fox News finding themselves in agreement because people watched the same entertainment Fox News story that same week. There is an absence of media ecology self-awareness of how media consumption (John 1:1) influences feelings of having something in common with mindsets. ===:::

"Man this is vile

They are trying to sabotage the hostage deal. By launching an attack on qatari soil (qatar is an intermediator between hamas/israel) they want the qatari to pull out of the negotiations and thus the israeli can say qatar is to blame for the hostages not being released.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/security-chiefs-negotiators-us-said-all-blaming-netanyahu-for-tanking-hostage-talks/

Article: Security chiefs, negotiators, US all said blaming Netanyahu for tanking hostage talks

This has happened before. The hostages could have been home over a year ago. But the Israelis want the genocide to continue.

This also covers up yesterday drone attack in the sumud flotilla. I wouldn't be surprised if the had a third attack in bound to iran or somewhere else.

Edit: its confirmed, they killed the hamas head negotiator."

"No they aren't next. Putin has been prepping a Baltic invasion for many years, has been clear on his aspirations. Even before Finland joined nato, Baltics was always next. Its not really up for discussion, we know what he wants. Baltics have much larger Russian populations than Finland, that's probably the biggest reason. They also fit better in line with his their tactical aspirations, joining st Petersburg up with Kalinigrad. Then there are historic reasons, returning the Soviet block."

"The simple fact is Putin and Russia are just evil and the fact that you don’t see large scale protests in Russia against Russia’s unprovoked invasion is not because Russians are in fear of Putin’s SS, it’s because the average Russian is perfectly fine with exterminating Ukraine and any other country or race Putin puts up on the pedestal as the “enemy of Russia”

The sooner we accept this harsh truth the sooner we can admit the only way this war can end is if the ordinary Russian citizen is made to know terror just as the Germans and Japanese were so they beg their government to stop the war"
