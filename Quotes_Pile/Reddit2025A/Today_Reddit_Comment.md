"Clueless that Putin is far smarter than he is yet that's the weakness on Trump, thinking he's the most powerful person in the world when thinking it is not enough you have to act like it yet he does not know how to."

"It’s almost as if there’s a desire to promote white supremacy in the US as widely as possible, relishing the fact that it gets to appear on everyone’s front page over and over and over again. Meanwhile redditors choose to respond to it by trying to one up each other with cutesy cultural memes instead of refusing to accept this filth. Others ask “genuine questions” to have commenters spell out what’s actually going on here in black and white. This is Propaganda 101, people, and you are being played."

"And they're almost always the most fucked up inbred brand of white person too. They are uneducated and uncurious as fuck and I absolutely despise when they try drag us normal white folk into their stupid theories and prejudices just cos we got the same skin colour. It is fun to ask them to elaborate and play dumb though cos some of the smarter ones will backpedal or stumble and the ones who proudly proclaim their racism makes it more satisfying for me to tell them to get the fuck out of my face, they don't belong near me."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : so "satisfying" to have racists around, a low bar, to measure against. So pleasing to the egomania that humanity is full of racists and other people to look down upon. No desire for a better humanity, just to despise people. Hate as faith. Despising humans as faith. Hat is so motivating and satisfying to people. Mass psychosis abounds. "MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M ===:::

"This really is horrific. The conservative movement is going full anti-vaxx here. This will need to nothing but needless suffering. They have no issue ordering people to comply with numerous rulings and ignoring their rights but when it comes to something that is actually a public good than it becomes evil.

Also, they downplay slavery in many respects, so their comparisons get weaker when they are also downplaying the worst things in history. I know there is a push to get rid of public education too but as a requirement to attend school, it does seem very legal. There is a clear public interest in vaccination on top of protecting the kids in the school system itself from needless illness and suffering."

"The takeover of the GOP with Trump was a Russian military operation spanning 40 years.. and will be remembered as one of the greatest military campaigns in history..

Putin was able to destroy America for less than a cost of a single naval vessel by simply bribing GOP and select Dem politicians.

Trump knew Giuliani through his real estate business.. Giuliani got paid by the Russian Mafia to get rid of the Italian Mafia. Giuliani introduced Trump to the Russian Mafia who introduced him to the oligarchs who introduced him to the Kremlin.."

"Trump = Odious. Craven. Feckless. Corrupt.

Unfortunately, the US has become untrustworthy, incoherent, unpredictable and unreliable.

The loss of the US’s reputational strength as well as its soft power and influence, will have massive repercussions for the world now and in the future."
