"Frigging nazis getting bolder every day and instead of dealing with the issue leadership is fanning the flames. This will get worse before it gets better, nazis need to be shamed to hiding again."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Sunday morning on Reddit, church lessons, USA church technique of *shame them*. Attitudes of: It's perfectly OK to have hate mindsets in people, but I want to be able to block them on social machines so I don't have to hear their specific flavor / brand of hate. Nothing will ever go wrong that I have accepted hate in every day of my life, I just don't want this one Germany hate system to be able to speak or communicate. A filter-bubble of egoism that hate is perfectly fine in the world as long as it is my kind of anti-humanism hate. That's the Reddit messaging of machine lust / worship of technology Reddit machines, to block and silence out the Nazi messages but perfectly fine with Reddit hate of some other kind - as long as it isn't Germany organized hate groups from "over there". Hate of Fox News vs. Bluesky and Reddit vs. Facebook is welcome on Reddit, but not the Germany hate system of Nazi messages. Shallow and superficial egomania culture of worship hate, just particular which choices are made from the buffet of hate subreddits. "nazis need to be shamed to hiding again" - the only goal is that they are hidden from sight / hidden and underground, like secret Islamic terrorists, in hiding. The message is: set a very low low low measuring bar of progress and reform. Don't listen to Malala and address the problems. Don't listen to MLK Jr and address the problems as a global issue. Just focus on the ones you don't personally find attractive. Short tiny Twitter-think logic about Russian information warfare. Russia has been feeding Nazi symbols for decades, as documented by Howard Bloom in his August 14, 2000 book (before September 11, 2001.. before MAGA and Trump). Techniques now adapted to the Internet Research Agency online Russian export... ... ...
"On the other side of the religious divide stood the new Fundamentalists of Racial Purity and Christianity, whose leaders skillfully manipulated conformity enforcement mechanisms which impel us to pick on those who are different. Typical among these was a group called **Russian National Unity**, which claimed an army of 70,000, snapped up members at the age of nine, enrolled them in "military patriotic clubs," dressed them in fascist uniforms, gave them the insignia of the **swastika, taught them the Nazi** salute" - Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century. Chapter: The Kidnap of Mass Mind. Page: 201. Howard Bloom. Published: August 14, 2000

"It's actually well established, even by the FBI:

Russian influence enabled the extreme media coverage (making things seem worse, etc.) that is now being used by US media as it has been shown to work for ads, etc. so the Russian seeds have worked.

There was real evidence for influence in 2016:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_between_Trump_associates_and_Russian_officials_and_spies

"The FBI's work was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who led a special counsel investigation until March 2019.[8] Mueller concluded that Russian interference was "sweeping and systematic" and "violated U.S. criminal law", and he indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations."

This one I haven't read, but if the citations are sound it's comprehensive:

https://github.com/mfreeze77/DJT/tree/main

Some very interesting info courtesty of u/Speffers98:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency - "...Russian company which was engaged in online propaganda and influence operations on behalf of Russian business and political interests"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear - "Russian cyber espionage group. American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has stated with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency"

https://nationalpost.com/news/world/a-russian-troll-farms-most-viewed-facebook-ad-wasnt-about-trump-it-promoted-u-s-law-enforcement - this is interesting. It's Russian troll farms pretending to fight each other online "left v right", etc.

https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html - same as above but with black rights.

This has only gotten worse and will continue to do so."

"This is what a lot of people don't realize. These countries (much like our own) have entire teams/programs dedicated to Psychological Operations. They study and have plenty of data on what is considered contentious subjects. Race, political affiliations all these things just waiting to be exploited. 

And those that fall into these false narritives about race and political identities becoming part of you own personal identity... You are playing right into the hands of foreign adversaries.

Furthermore, particularly on the political front... Politicians are not representing you - left or right - they are representing their own monetary interests. Do you know of a congressperson or someone who has been president thats not a multimillionaire? So tread with caution before you start fighting IRL or virtually online for any higher office people. Look at their actions, not their words and be smart. Don't fall into herd mentality. It's a trap no matter what side you are on.

Plenty of other more fruitful places to 'belong'."

"This is maybe not the best example. The right decided that she‚Äôs also one of their martyrs (since she was a pretty white woman killed by a black guy in a Democrat city) and have been posting about her everywhere. Conservatives just raised over $2.5 million to install murals of Iryna Zarutska all over the US (with $1 million being donated by Elon Musk). They‚Äôve highly politicized her death as well. Of course, it‚Äôs all performative because you know that 90% of them don‚Äôt give a shit about Ukrainian refugees or justice/mental health reform otherwise and, if Twitter posts are anything to go by, are just clamoring to say slurs because of the race angle."

"r/conservative is like the ultimate propaganda machine right now(more than normal). I know the leftist can get stuck in a circle jerk until the issues seem satirical, from time to time, but conservatives take this shit to another level. The projection going on over there. Those "facts" that don't give a fuck about our feelings aren't even in their favor on any of this, and the term "groyper" is nowhere to be found on that sub. I'm sure there's a fair number of Nick Fuentes followers over there.

They cannot wrap their heads around one of their own doing this, even though some conservative nut jobs have already done a few assassinations and attempted assassinations this year. I think they forgot about those cause they just used them to take cheap shots at the victims. They're even more delusional than they accuse the liberals of being."

"Part of the problem is that disinformation has become so normalized and pervasive that those influenced by Fox News, the GOP, and other right-wing personalities are utterly convinced of their own correctness. It is cognitively impossible, for many of them, to recognize that they are wrong and that the figures they support embody the opposite of the values they claim to champion.

What we are witnessing is a profound erosion of critical thinking, a phenomenon that social media has amplified and that opportunistic actors have deliberately exploited. The warning signs were present years ago: numerous mass shooters were found to have engaged with fringe extremist communities online. These groups succeed by fostering belonging, portraying their members as embattled minorities, and convincing them they are under existential threat.

Scaled up, the same tactics now affect millions of ordinary Americans who sincerely believe they are dismantling a ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù and restoring democracy. In reality, their actions serve to undermine the very democratic institutions they think they are defending.

At least, that‚Äôs my take on it."
