"There are literally tweets of MAGA mothers who said if Trump would rape their daughters they would be upset but they'd still vote for him. It's really far beyond the realm of anything resembling rational thinking.

People like this need to be barred from taking part in elections, for life. The age of the right to vote is over."

"I agree. Also, I'm not sure we care so much about kids in this country, just look at our gun laws. It might be a huge scandal but nothing will change until the general population stops giving in to the rhetoric and demand that everyone be treated with respect and dignity."

"Nah, they don't care. One of the analysts that I listen to often says that Russia uses a "post-truth" propaganda approach. They don't care about secrets because they systematically decrease the value of truth and fight against our ability to believe in anything. They would just spread multiple conflicting rumours on any important subject, until your only option is to believe what you like, not what is supported by evidence."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This is an INCREDIBLY PROVEN system. In The Bible monomyth science fiction story: Matthew / Mark / Luke / John write multiple rumors that becomes a *choose your own adventure* to afterlife heaven rewards story. Extremely compelling and Surkov and Putin mastered this 25 years ago and have adapted it to Reddit / Bluesky / Twitter / meme addict society of USA since March 2013. Create 5,000 variations of Matthew / Mark / Luke / John. My entire repeating repeat repeat repeating media ecology assertions ("Wake Indra" opera) about Surkov / McLuhan / Postman / Campbell / Enter Shikari / Pomerantsev is based on *moving beyond* King Trump / King Putin and this model. ...
"II.4, portraying the drunken and sleeping Earwicker's dream, chronicles the spying of four old men (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) on Tristan and Iseult's journey. The short chapter portrays "an old man like King Mark being rejected and [abandoned by young lovers who sail off into a future](https://youtu.be/2ROK1-VvOQ0?t=182) without him", while the four old men observe Tristan and Isolde, and offer four intertwining commentaries on the lovers and themselves which are "always repeating themselves"." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake ===:::

"No, it was mostly the economy and while I think Biden did a good job people were still feeling economic pain and she basically said she would just keep doing what he was doing which a lot of people didn't understand had been working. Trump spoke to a lot of people's economic frustrations, and people also remember the economy being better under him at least up until covid (which I would argue was mostly just him riding Obama's coattails but yeah doesn't change people's memories of better times)."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I agree: "Trump spoke to a lot of people's economic frustrations" - that greed and rich people need more. That's the frustrations of Trump media addicts. That the rich people don't make fancy enough films or war footage and things need to be more Reality TV / fiction Internet meme like all the time. Economic frustrations that the wealthy don't get enough free speech. Economic frustrations that Putin can't just take Ukraine and anything he wishes. What good is wealth and power if you can't do everything your nightmares tell you to do? "it was mostly the economy"... no, it is all about entertainment addiction. Trump provides Tony Clifton mockery and hate. The economy of memes, the economy of media content addictions. ===:::

"She was worse than status quo. She was a historically unpopular, gun toting, genocide supporting moderate that campaigned with Republicans. But we were supposed to vote for her because she's black and a woman. The DNC learned the hard way that identity politics and whataboutisms don't win elections."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We The People of Reddit / Bluesky don't ever learn. People act like "learning the hard way" is a proven system of understanding and comprehension. If that were **true true**, then the Middle East would have leanred the hard way how many thousands of years ago? Toxic poluarity is not evidence of popularity being good. Democracy does not work when people toss compassion and love into the trash in favor of meme addictions on Reddit. A meme society unwilling to study media ecology and Russian information warfare thinking this situation is only domestic USA elections and not global information war. Apparently, there isn't enough Trump praising Putin in public for Reddit community to go read nonfiction books about how Russia actually operates. Reddit infiltrated by Kremlin mind-fuck.
[**All of you guys out there in the Middle East are out of the same Melting Pot. And you're all as crazy as a butterfly on absenth**. I don't know whether you're all Canaanites at the base or you're all Jews at the base or out of the land of Nod or whatever the hell you were at the get go. Semites or whatnot, but **you've been fighting there now for something like 8,000 years. And you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and peace. You're forever killing each other and sticking knives at each other and burning babies and the world has had to suffer with this.** Great things have come out of the Middle East. Great things like the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity seems to be your chief export. Stupidity and violence are your cash crops all you.

"I don’t think people are grasping the gravity of the situation: the tariffs Trump has placed, have already put the farming and steel industry in a very precarious position.

This is the bubble with a needle inches away from popping it. This isn’t a “this will definitely happen in x amount of time!” It’s in the “if a gust of air hits this bubble, there’s a very real and very tangible chance it’s floating not only in the direction of that needle, but directly into it.”

Economically, it would not seem to take a large fumble to set in motion a catastrophe in similar proportions to what happened in 2008.

Very much a “not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’” "

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I don't think people are grasping the gravity of the situation. Fiction addiction is EVERY DAY all the time, not just the economy. Medical truth is abandoned in favor of Russain fiction storytelling, etc. People are willing to die for fiction stories. EVER DAY, not just election days.

"And he has absolutely murdered international relations with long term allies. Canada has essentially collectively boycotted all American product, and ceased all tourism, bankrupting cities that rely on it. Even other countries hesitate due to the very real chance of getting detained on the border for weeks then either sent back home or disappeared to Alligator Auschwitz without a word. These aren’t issues that can easily be fixed with time."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : No, time alone isn't going to fix it. People, WE THE PEOPLE, need to admit to a foundation error in our behaviors. That media addiction / meme addiction / trash media consumption of ficton has wrecked goodness itself. That The Middle East Bible is science fiction and we are not equating the 2,000 year old Bible poblem to Fox News / Newsmax / Reddit / Bluesky fiction addiction problem in modern mediums. We have "Amusing Ourselves To Death" as described in 1985 by Neil Postman. We the PEOPLE addressing that Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton is mockery addiciton, mocking and insulting how terrile and bad Clifton is at being on stage. ADMITTING IT, every single person getting on social media age 12 to age 120, and memorizing and reciting Neil Postman's short 184 page book! Stand up for Jen Senko! Stand up for self-awareness of media addiction behavior to Donald Trump antics. ===:::

"Especially because he's doing exactly what he promised. He didn't delude his voters, they deluded themselves.

Harris: He's going to destroy the economy on purpose

Trump: I'm going to destroy the economy on purpose

Republican voters: He's going to be great for the economy!"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit meme adicts think that *rural uneducated Trump supporters* did it to themselves and Rupert Murdoch has no role in it. Media ecology educaiton is not optional, every person age 12 to age 120 needs to face up to Neil Postman's library of published books about media ecology. We are "Amsuing Ourselves To Death" on Reddit and Fox News. Rupert Murdoch is predatory, Trump Social (Trump) is predatory. They didn't *delude their own self*. See also: Church / Mosque / Torah / Bible / Quran. Indoctrination into Fox News fiction, indoctrination into Bible fiction. ===:::

"Dems have high key been fumbling elections for years now.  Reddit hates having this conversation, but there’s nothing unifying the left.  Every election has people at each other’s throats until they finally decide on a candidate, only for people to just straight up not vote because it wasn’t the Democratic candidate that *they* wanted.

Hopefully these next two years can finally get people to the polls because, for as much as I thought Biden did a fine job, there hasn’t been a strong Democratic competitor since Obama."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : New corporations come up all the time. Reddit itself was created, a technology startup. Why do Reddit community members think the only possible answer in democracy / free society is to "Democrats party". Why not create a list of things you want, post it on Reddit, and show that people actually desire goodness itself. Alas, people do indeed do this, and find that the audience is addicted to left vs. right one-bit logic thinking. Which the Founding Fathers did not promote in the Decleration of Independence, Great Seal, or Constitution. The boundless faith that there are TWO and ONLY TWO sides to every problem: Republican vs Democrat!  One-bbit thinking. Which the Founding Fathers recognized and in year 1776 created the Great Seal of the United States of America as a teching tool. Fiction vs. nonfiction. Mythology vs. scieence. Not left vs. right logic. Not single-bit, but 13-steps on the pyramid up the Great Seal. "there hasn’t been a strong Democratic competitor since Obama" - which is declaring that Donald Trump is a great competititor. Trump selling fiction, Donald Trump and Fox News sell fiction. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Obama was the *last* before the Internet Research Agency (IRA, Russia) took over Reddit / Twitter / everyone mindsets. Fiction addiction vs. science reality. We have normalized a Russian supporter (Trump and Tucker Carlson and many others) as a healthy candidate for President. We The People lost a mind-fuck war without even realizing, zero self-awareness of the situation. "Dems have high key been fumbling elections for years now" is WRONG - CORRECTED: the Pentagon has fumbled hybrid warfare since March 2013. ===:::

"I'm gonna be honest here, if the threat of a Trump destroying the country isn't enough to unite Democrat voters, maybe they deserve to get eaten by that particular leopard. That's Democracy in a nutshell, you don't vote for the candidate you like the most, you vote for the one who you dislike the least and work on getting someone better in the future."

"Sure, because as we all know voters- be they MAGA or people that stayed home- have utterly no agency or responsibility for their own actions and decisions. They're just helpless bystanders that only act at the behest of external forces.

Kinda like how if I get arrested for running someone over while driving drunk, the judge and jury will absolutely accept my excuse that the real culprit is my friend at the bar that couldn't convince me not to drink and drive."

"That’s says more about the intelligence or morality of the citizens than the quality of Democrats

Democrats are far from perfect but anyone who chose Trump over Kamala is stupid or evil. And anyone who didn’t vote because they thought both sides are the same or they wanted to send a message is just stupid"
