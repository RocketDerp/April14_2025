"This is just plain false. This is absolutely being covered by major western media networks.

The people who complain about something "not being covered by western media" are usually the ones who don't even watch the news or read online newspapers. Often, they only get their news from Reddit or other social media, so when something isn't on the front page of Reddit or being spammed on Twitter, they think nobody else is covering it."

"you guys are stupid if you think the United States has any control over what Israel does. The relationship does not work like that, Israel doesn't know whatever it wants with American tax payer money. Then uses the United States to clean it up"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Israel and USA population consumes the same science fiction story "Torah" with Adam / Eve / Moses (Bible front section, "Old Testiment" in the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible) and think they have common values and grounds. It is like the audience of fiction Fox News finding themselves in agreement because people watched the same entertainment Fox News story that same week. There is an absence of media ecology self-awareness of how media consumption (John 1:1) influences feelings of having something in common with mindsets. ===:::

"Man this is vile

They are trying to sabotage the hostage deal. By launching an attack on qatari soil (qatar is an intermediator between hamas/israel) they want the qatari to pull out of the negotiations and thus the israeli can say qatar is to blame for the hostages not being released.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/security-chiefs-negotiators-us-said-all-blaming-netanyahu-for-tanking-hostage-talks/

Article: Security chiefs, negotiators, US all said blaming Netanyahu for tanking hostage talks

This has happened before. The hostages could have been home over a year ago. But the Israelis want the genocide to continue.

This also covers up yesterday drone attack in the sumud flotilla. I wouldn't be surprised if the had a third attack in bound to iran or somewhere else.

Edit: its confirmed, they killed the hamas head negotiator."

"No they aren't next. Putin has been prepping a Baltic invasion for many years, has been clear on his aspirations. Even before Finland joined nato, Baltics was always next. Its not really up for discussion, we know what he wants. Baltics have much larger Russian populations than Finland, that's probably the biggest reason. They also fit better in line with his their tactical aspirations, joining st Petersburg up with Kalinigrad. Then there are historic reasons, returning the Soviet block."

"The simple fact is Putin and Russia are just evil and the fact that you don’t see large scale protests in Russia against Russia’s unprovoked invasion is not because Russians are in fear of Putin’s SS, it’s because the average Russian is perfectly fine with exterminating Ukraine and any other country or race Putin puts up on the pedestal as the “enemy of Russia”

The sooner we accept this harsh truth the sooner we can admit the only way this war can end is if the ordinary Russian citizen is made to know terror just as the Germans and Japanese were so they beg their government to stop the war"

"These people navigate their lives by social proof and mindless consumerism, and they absolutely need a media caricature of a righteous power daddy to tell them what to do, think, and feel. We live in an age of media zombies. These people live in a top-down, paternalistic hyperreal fever dream, and would trust the reality TV guy over their own dear little granny or next door neighbor. Nothing is real unless it is on TV, and their [Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) reinforces that the wealthy and powerful can do no wrong.

Southern Redeemers and Confederate propagandists won the cultural Civil War over the course of the 20th century. We are living in a country in which the Yankee ideal of liberty and rule of law has been defeated. These paleo-conservatives are not only taking us back to a time before the American Revolution, they want to erase the Enlightenment from history all together.

While the rest of the country was becoming a modern pluralistic democracy from the 1870s to the 1960s, the South was inventing the modern idea of apartheid. When Trump and modern Republicans speak of "retribution," they are talking about taking revenge on the rest of us who believe in democracy and universal suffrage. They are still mad about Reconstruction (which failed within 10 years anyway), Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights era, and the Voting Rights Act (which they already dismantled). We are entering a new "reconstruction" in which people of Southern worldview are the new "carpetbaggers" imposing their ideal of apartheid and white slave power oligarchy on the rest of the country.

Reconstruction failed and Southern Redeemers were allowed to take hold of the media over the course of the 20th century, and here we are. The Right always talks about a mythical "woke" leftwing Hollywood, because historically the exact opposite is true. From The Birth of a Nation which developed many of the modern Hollywood cinematography techniques, to Gone with the Wind, to the Hollywood Blacklist, John Wayne and Roy Rogers' "cowboy frontier thesis mythology" which Ronald Reagan effectively weaponized in his fascist rise to power, to reality television and the rise of Donald Trump. The media is built around placating the sensibilities of Southern teenagers. The rest of us never had a chance."
