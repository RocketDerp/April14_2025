"Because its just justification for violence against the undesirables. Thats why they try and paint trans and other LGBT people as pedos all the time, and why the right pounces on any story of a immingrant/muslim/brown person being a pedo."

"Conservatives don't believe in using words accurately.

When they say pedophile or groomer they're not talking about the youth pastor who got a 17 year old pregnant. They're talking about gay people being gay in public. 

There's a lot of focus on trans folks right now, but the conservative movement at large has never accepted any kind of LGBTQ+ lifestyle.

They're way more ok with a 25 year old dude getting a 15 year old girl pregnant because that's regular "normal" sex. As long as they get married, they might not have any problem with it at all. 

That sticker is just calling for the execution of gay people. It's not ironic, the words just mean different things to them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Conservatives do not grasp the John 1:1 *poetry and only poetry, words and only words* crisis. The Tower of Babel metaphor. Conservatives think fighting others with violence and hate over language and words (no outsiders who speak Spanish from Mexico, etc) is good, not comprehnding the meaning of the Tower of Babel lesosns to *transcend* the tower of langauges and memes. [James Joyce's year 1924 onward Finnegans Wake publication is essential for our highest educators and teachers to grasp in the modern media ecology systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV3vT5nW_I4) so they can teach the other teachers. It is likely not practical for every person to learn Finnegans Wake, but we can have a millions across the world who *teach the teachers*. ===:::

"This isn’t ironic to them. These people are dumb. They can’t put two and two together that Trump won’t release them because he’s in them. They believe his constant lies. What gets me is if he wasn’t in them, he’d absolutely release them to make himself seem more like a god, but again anyone left in maga is not smart."

It's absolute madness."

"Conservative voters have shown that they don't care much for fact checking. The burden of proof falls to their opponents, and *gods fuck them* if even one iota of a statement is not perfectly accurate or said conservatives will devolve the conversation into character assassination.

They don't exactly argue in good faith when their only faith is trying to seize power."
