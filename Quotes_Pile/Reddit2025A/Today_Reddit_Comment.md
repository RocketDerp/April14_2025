"Ya know, the shittiest part of this is that even though that dude is an utterly useless asshat I will still fight for his right to survive.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We have a massive media ecology crisis described 40 years ago in Neil Postman's year 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To DeatH" about television news systems. Adult education isn't optional. We need to educate people why Fox News is wrong, we can't keep leeting rural uneducated adults in USA not comrprehend how Facbook, Fox News, Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter works on their mind. Russia won, Surkov won the information war since March 2013 because we did not educate rural Americans with media ecology. Neil Postman's 1985 book was essential for the smartphone age, and we did not teach it to every adult. ===:::
