"With respect, I think you have it backwards. The wealthy and powerful have been honing their playbooks to inflame their Konfederacy of Kooks: the uber-religious, the anti-vaxers, Christian nationalists, isolationists, racists and gun nuts (I've probably missed a few). All of those groups are essentially single issue, and will vote in lockstep with whatever party addresses their concerns.

What's also obvious is that none of those groups have any concerns that will actually affect the truly wealthy and powerful of this country. Does anyone actually think that the Thiels/Murdochs/Trumps/Kochs/Mercers of this country are going to let one of us poors open carry a gun in their presence, that those families are going to stop vaccinating their kids, or that they give a fuck about paper coffee cups?

The rich people are calling the shots in a way that gets them what they want (tax cuts and breaks for the rich and corporations) and that will only affect the poors(all of us) negatively. The dog is wagging the tail here, not the other way around."

"Ok, respectfully, I get the desire to embellish; but 'enormous' is not the word that comes to mind when I watch the video. They took over maybe a city block, if that? Access to Trump Tower was not impugned in any real way. The numbers weren't particularly staggering. And...everyone will think I'm criticizing the protestors. I'm not. I'm criticizing the headline.

We, as a people, are exhausted by embellished sensationalized headlines that call us to action while presenting an image of media clip that presents a starkly different picture to what's being projected in the wording. This discredits and diminishes any attached movement, because it makes the movement seem, in the uninformed viewer's eyes, desperate for attention.

Essentially: You have called my attention to this event; and presented it as a large, substantive incident; when in reality it is no more or less then the hundreds and thousands of moderately sized protests I have already seen. You got my hope up that finally action was being taken; and the absence of that in reality, reminded me of the deficit of energy that we seem to be suffering. You have wasted my time, you have wasted my energy; and you made the movement seem desperate and inadequate.

I understand you have to write eye catching headline; it's your job. But don't rely on explosive wording to do it. It would have been a much better headline to say, "Protests across the nation against the Trump Regime ongoing. The latest has occurred in front of Trump Tower; and is the most recent indication that the movement is gathering steam."

Even better would have been to do some actual reporting; and finding out if there's any cross philosophy agitation involved; are there a handful of former Red Hats? If so, what motivated them to change perspective. What's the common ground? What are the issues?

But hey. What can you do. We should have buried tabloid journalism when we had the chance. Instead of allowing an unnecessary unholy union of information and entertainment."

"It doesnt make any sense as to why one state is better than the other. When Trump says "because mail in ballots" were fucked. He wants to move all major military presence out of blue states ahead of civil war."

"Is this about Epstein? No? Then we don't care"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length binary-thinking (1 single bit) Tweet-logic. Promoting that you should be a one-topic concern, one and only one thing to pay attention to. Simplicity itself. ...
"And I think that… the way people deal with this is interesting. They deal with it as a form of complexity, a word I have used probably too many times. It makes the people caught in this cusp between an old world and an old paradigm that is dying and a new one that cannot really yet be born. And we find ourselves in that space. And it draws us to people like Ross Perot who say “It’s just that simple… it’s just that simple… it’s just that simple”. That’s **the most powerful political rhetoric in a world** with a postmodern trajectory. God, how we would love it if someone could tell us anything was “just that simple”" - https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/ ...
And notice how many of the single-topic voters only want to vote on sex. Sex of women having abortions about sexual pregnancy. Sex of Donald Trump on Epstein's rich people sex lives private jet. Every other topic is of zero concern, only that they constantly message to everyone that [ONLY ONE THING MATTERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-issue_politics): sex topics. ===:::

"As if we need more proof they're so disconnected from the rest of humanity. Their two specialties are making overly optimistic statements about concepts that quickly becomes proven failures or creating tech whose core concepts are the most horrific choices from dystopian sci-fi settings. Their positive contributions to the world ended after the dotcom bubble burst."

"They're trying to convince people that the people aren't being slaughtered in a religious holy extermination, but they're simply being removed from their impoverished situation in order to make way for the high tech futurist city of tomorrow! Futurists rejoice! *It's not a genocide, it's the hard work that needs to be done in order to become a true futurist society*

Nevermind how they could do this shit in the farmlands of Texas if they really wanted, or Israel could volunteer any of their coastline. They don't HAVE to do the world of tomorrow on the ruins of the Palestinian's last strip of land."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992 ===:::

These stories are always, he's going down for sure, his health is so bad etc. Nothing ever changes. Wake me up when he dies. Actually don't because nothing is going to change."
