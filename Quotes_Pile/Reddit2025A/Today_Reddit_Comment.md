"Imagine using Charlie Kirk as the shining example of why higher education isn’t necessary. That’s not the flex she thinks it is."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit comment is not the flex one-line Twitter-lenth reply to a Laura Loomer Twitter-length message that the community thinks it is. Russian information warfre uncited, deliberate ass-bacwads contradictions to create engagement. Spelled out by BBC's Adam Curtis at the end of y=ear 2014: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html - The ignroance of how Twitter information wroks with Surkov techniques is horrific. People can not resist the *engagement* of mocking bak at Putin techniques. Mockind back is not resisting Tony Clifton methods / mocking back is not assertin nonfiction education of media ecology / media addiction behavior. It is being a media addict to simplistic "gotcha" low-effort noise mental states. That'show Russia defeated the USA since March 2013 using Twitter-think. This very Reddit comment is doing it. Another ttile for Neil Postmans' 1985 book "Mocking Ourselves To Death with high-speed electric media engagement" ===:::

"The texts are very weird to me. They intricately detail each piece of evidence we knew authorities have and are worded like they were written by a 60 year old."

A media addicts dream. MY HELL AND NIGHTMARE, TRUTH SOCIAL NOW RUNS THE USA, ELON MUSK TWITTER / REDDIT BULLSHITING IS CONSIDERED GOOD TASTE, FALSEHOODS AND TRICKY INFORMATION! Twitter-length messages that are predictable in ther shallow superficial, citing no author names, citing no book names on media ecology. Neil Postman spinning in his grave at how this is the force of human amusement and LOL that are driving the nation. Fuck meme-speak of Twitter-length simplistic answers to Russian informaton warfare wtihout being able to rub any nonfiction citations together! ===:::

Avoiding the very concepts of: misunderstanding, comprehension, reactionary short-thinking patterns.

"And, no real mistakes anywhere?  I had to re swipe 'anywhere' twice in my reply.. And I skipped 'my' .. Lol. I also really don't understand why he ditched his rifle before leaving? Wasn't it in his backpack on the way up and down the stairs?  I'm confused all together."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Not a Reddit media addict on their computer screens can cite the ELIZ effect from year 1966 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect by name. Despite consuming messages off Reddit that they constantly are bewildered if a real person with no-identity accoutns from anywhere on the world. Constantly confusing authentic people with "bots", dehumanizing others. Their personal excellent good taste in trash memes has made them experts on Finnegans Wake language patterns and seams in the human brain around the Tower of Babel experience. Glued with every spare moment to filter-bubble subreddits refreshing for the latest trending style and meme-format fashion, the latest South Park animation to inform them in Spongebob-meme thinking what is current fashion for Morman family in Utah for a young man who maintains his grandfather's old-school rifle.

"This is the most convincing thing to me that something inauthentic is likely up. I don't paint with a broad brush, so among the millions of people his age there's probably some that text like that...but it's a lot harder to imagine someone that texts like that *and* puts those kinds of memes on bullet casings."

The Reddit audience is entirely *glued* to their touchscreen caressing describing the emotional sense of mystery they feel in the Trump Putin Kirk media enviornment of mythology storytelling. Elect liars and deceivers and fiction ("The Apprentice" Reality TV is fiction) content creators for the sake of constant meme entertainment and mockery and drive your REAL WORLD United States of America into ruin!

"Ironically, they have a 22 year old as part of their Homeland Security leadership. Did nobody think to run the messages through him, given that it's probably one of the only jobs he would have actually been somewhat qualified for?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : A sus message. Tool / Owned / plant / confused? Encourage Reddit community to trust a 22 year old person who blindly trusts the Trump White House / Trump and Putin administration. A 22 true believer that the future of the USA is served by these leaders. That's the expert Reddit message is calling for. Why not call for text messages and emails from OUTSIDE the incident that this Charlie Kirk shooter created over the past 10 years? They have been posting photos of him as a teenager on Reddit posing with guns and military hardwarew. Why not request hundreds of pages of his personal writings to friends and roommates? Because that is media ecology, and Reddit users want an ingorant population to constantly stimulate them with rerpetitive one-line jokes as Reddit comments. ===:::

"This is what will be one of the downfalls of MAGA: they don’t even believe themselves. Seriously. They have conspiracies for their conspiracies. Lmao. They can’t live in reality for one day."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : On Reddit can you trust other Reddit users with hidden identity, going to extreme efforts to conceal any identifying information? Yet here this Reddit user is with zero situational awareness of Reddit community https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 itself. Unable to cite any published authors or name the Internet Research Agency that mind-fucked MAGA and Reddit into polairty out-group hate patterns since march 2013. Why can't Reddit turn to actual nonfiction public library section and say more than Twitter-length reaction commetns every single minute of every single day over and over? Because Putin has *owned* the hearts and minds of USA sicne March 2013.   
... ... ...
"And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where **even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives**, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, **a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies** is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

"It’s insane how no one’s satisfied with the investigation like at all. I’ve seen left and right say the official story is terrible and doesn’t make any sense. Frankly the official story is kinda bad, I still haven’t seen any explanations about why that guy in the crowd screaming he did it for you know why he did that and I’ve heard nothing about the pellet rifle guy. The whole he took apart and rebuilt his gun multiple times just to abandoned it. Now the guy who faked it has CP charges too. Plus I’m 4 years older than this guy and yeah I think the text exchanges seem wack."

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.

Reddit comment "It’s insane how no one’s satisfied" - infromation strip tease, endless new fresh comments, constant addiction behaviors to Reddit aging out 4 hour old comments for an empty zero-comment posting to start the cycle all over again. Light speed informaiton systems, constant 24 hours a day of low-effort comments and avoidance of the public library nonfiction section. "It’s insane how no one’s satisfied" - information strip tease just like the magica wildcard Epstein Super List ARG game on Reddit!

"Given the entire right wing was blaming trans people before Kirk's body even got to the hospital, it's clear they were primed for something.

And given since then it's been this endless drumbeat of trying to make it trans people's fault somehow? All like what, a week after Trump floated banning trans people from owning guns?

If you're looking at less than 1% of the population and instantly blaming them for everything, and you're also talking about disarming just them -- the shit you have planned for that group starts as "atrocity" and ends in "mass extermination".

People rarely shoot at cops or feds because it's a very effective way of getting yourself killed. "We better take their guns first" means the odds of living are even worse if you don't shoot back."
