"Ever notice how all these "I swear I'm not a Republican, I always try listening to both sides" celebrities only come out with these "we should support the president regardless of party" and "I'll pray for the president because if he succeeds, then our country succeeds" statements when a Republican is president? Funny coincidence."

"Read his excuse for supporting his cousin in law RFK Jr. Something like - he's a real good guy. We don't talk politics at family gatherings. Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?

Here's the thing Chris. Your Cousin has said vaccines are harmful. When confronted - he claims he said no such thing. Now, he's promoting anti vaxx policies. No need to trust the media or even talking to him."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?" -- which media? media ecology? Which date? Which idea? Where is your webspage showing where the media said fiction. Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Was it fan fiction about your movies? And you think media is the only creator of fiction. Name *one single person* in the entire world, of over 8 billion people, who is perfectly accurate and never ever confuses fiction with nonfiction? **PLEASE... name them, who is accurate and perfect in nonfiction**? Donald Trump can't tell fiction from nonfiction consistely does not comrpehend nonfiction. ===::::
