"For real tho. I had this account "permanently" suspended by the admin bots for "harassment", for simply commenting in a thread about applying kinetic force to the faces of modern adherents of the tenets of national socialism. By some miracle I was able to successfully appeal the suspension to a human being.

However, because of this "permanent suspension", all of my alts got suspended for being associated to this account. Again, for the sole reason of this false "harassment" suspension that an AI bot dreamed up.

On each of those accounts I filed an appeal after this account was restored. In each case the appeal was rejected, because they found I "violated the rules", with no further clarification.

Again, this was all because their killbot falsely suspended this one account for what appeared to be an AI hallucination. I had not logged into the alts in months, and did not log into them until after this account was restored and found them suspended for no reason except they were associated to this account via the IP address."

It's been TEN FUCKING YEARS of non-stop mocking and insulting Donald Trump as a terrible person. People in USA are so exploited in the brain to not recognize that Trump is playing Tony Clifton act with improv audience interaction. Mocking, hate, dehumanization magnet. The entire USA has adopated faith in hate and mocking. USA society is nothing at all like what it ws in year 2012 - every area of life has been consumed by this horribile faith in dehumanizing. Hate thy enemy nation. People love their social machines but huate human persons! Trump is a magnet for hate, Trump inspires hate. Peoople are media addicted to their machines delivering Trump hate messages, people will not face the media addiction itself and Russian media warfare that started in March 2013. ===:::

He’s declined so much that if you look at him even just 2-3 years ago there’s a noticeable difference."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Let it be known world: This twitter-length tweet-think comment is shallow. Let it be known: People here in USA are not *afraid* of Donald J. Trump. What people can't tolerate in USA is boredom of Joe Biden and normal intelligent people. Study The Killing Fields in Cambodia 1975. People in USA are scared to death of not having nonstop amusement and entertainment. That is why they won't do the ONE THING that addresses Donald Trump Reality TV "The Apprentice" and Fox News - be serious and sustained about teaching media ecology. People here are so afraid of their own addiciton to television (Donald Trump is a total addict to media content), that they wont' discuss media warfare even from enemy nation Russia. [Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" explains Donald Trump and Putin's power over the population. Twitter thinking and meme addiciton to mockery and insulting, Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton is irresistable to chuckleheadn amused societ](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/). We here in USA have social media channel after social media feed streaming non-stop Trump hate content. Fox News is not "old with bad health", and people like the same fiction content bullshit addiction that you see with Donald Trump. Look at the other people like Elon Musk, they provide fiction Twitter content. We have a nassive media ecology crisis, addiction to fiction. Donald Trump is the ringleader of media addicts population. Joe Biden was "sleepy boring" to people, not entertaining. Jimmy Carter was not entertaining in 1979, people voted for entertainer Ronald Reagan - that is the topic of Neil Postmans' 1985 book (Reagan's second term in office, entertainment amusement addiction). ===:::

"Except Vance isn't taking "vacations". He's flying around and meeting with donors all over the nation and the world. He's *campaigning*! In each of his "vacations", hes meeted with various moneyed interests!

The US government legally can't pay for Vance to meet with his donors, but they can pay for his "vacation trips", hence why so many vacations! But Vance is doing some politicking on the side."

"Vance is making moves behind the scenes that neither you, nor I, nor even Trump are aware of. You think Peter Thiel is loyal to trump? Peter Thiel merely looked at Trump as a way to get Vance in..heck even Vance isn't loyal to trump he hated the guy right up until the moment Peter Thiel told him the plan. Trump doesn't even know what the heck is going on each day, he's already talking about if he will get into heaven, he's mixing up names, mixing up oceans, can't even remember countries, doesn't even remember what he says anymore. Peter Thiel is bankrolling the data mining for his companies, and allowing heritage to inject itself into every nook of government so they can execute P2025 to completion. While trump walks around pretending to be a president with sharpies and executive orders he is incapable of reading himself"

"Yeah, I agree. Vance is an opportunist. Most of the top MAGA seem stupid but Vance is smart. He couldn't have gotten this far without intelligence and patience. Out of all Trump's possible replacements, he scares me the most. Thankfully, he is not the most charismatic person. It seems really hard for him to hide his smug arrogance for long periods. 

I am surprised he hasn't tried to remove Trump from office yet. Maybe he doesn't have the backing to do it now. I think all the vacations are a way to distance himself from Trump."

While he was campaigning last year it was so obvious that he's in rapid cognitive decline. Even just comparing August 2024 Diaper Donnie to today's it's ridiculous how far he's degraded."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Look at the trash on every social media system.

Donald Trump provides endless stimulation to meme addicts who play crave any fiction story. People are compeletely repulsed by nonfiction authentic learning. People are addicted to the Kremlin War Against Realty / War Against Nonficiton that started March 2013. It is not just ONE MAN, Donald Trump, the trash media is all over Reddit and Fox News - and peple on social machines can't stop chanting "couhc couhc couhc" whenever JD Vance comes up, etc. It is the anti-intellectulism, the ficiton addiction, driving USA population.

"When Trump dies, MAGA implodes.

There is no heir to the throne. If Trump wanted MAGA as a movement to outlast him he'd have groomed a successor and familiarized the base with them, but he can't abide the spotlight being on anyone but himself so he hasn't. When he dies, conservative notables will nominate themselves as his "spiritual successor" and try to capture the MAGA vote. But there's no one on the scene who comes anywhere near being Trump's obvious follow-up, so the base will tear itself apart in factional infighting."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : When dealing with widespared fiction addiction, it is important to study comparative mythology. Trump is mythological, a *myth*. L Ron Hubbard, Mohammad - both dead, but the fiction media story continues of the Quran and Scientology storytelling. Fox News since October 7, 1996 has planted parts of a mythological story of a type of leadership and billionare worship (wealth televagelsim) that goes beyond Donald Trump and Putin worshiping. Elon Musk is being worshiped with Twitter media venue. Rupert Murdoch worship has been very successful. Surkov Kremlin + Cambridge Analytica information warfare since March 2013 has put is way deeper into mythological monomyth fiction patterns. ===:::

"I disagree. They don't actually need charisma. Trump is the wrench in the gears, he's the wild card that holds them back from moving even more quickly on all of these things. The rest of JDs cronies are already installed in every major tech company and key government positions. Things will fly when they can finally get rid of Trump.

And I think the slow release of Epstein files is just to give Trump time to die before it causes them bigger issues. Once he's dead they can say fuck it and put that behind them too.

I do think the base will be fragmented, but they've got plenty of time to essentially end the midterm elections, and these idiots still won't vote for a Democrat but they'll stand in line all day to vote for someone they don't like."

"He's arguably much, much more dangerous. Trumps ego has constantly been clashing with the wishes of the heritage foundation, whereas Vance would be a direct puppet.

And I think you're kidding yourself if you think "he doesn't have the pull of trump", it's not Trump, it's Peter Thiel and Billionaires money having influence over politics right now, everything else is just a show for the masses."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  "just show for the masses" - the Tony Clifton act will become tedius for the audience *at some point*, despite the entire population reveling in the mockery and hate and dehumanization of the Tony Clifton performance of Trump, the anti-Canada anti-Greenland anti-NATO waves will continue to be exploited by China and Russia and the anti-goodness campaign of Putin and Trump will be seen by everday people. Trump could become a scaptegoat, as so many USA people are screaming at MAGA to wake up. But it will not be an authentic media addiction wake (Dublin Finnegans Waie, 1924 publication onward), it will just b onion peeling of a few layers of the largest onion in all human history in terms fo monomyth fiction patterns. The Kremlin won the information war since March 2013, addiciton to fiction runs incredibly deep in USA population, meeme addiciton isn't being addressed. Neil Postman's 1985 book 'Amusing Ourselves To Death" on media ecology (electric media, Fox News, Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter, TikToK, etc) tries to explain. The older 1985 book perspective is key to getting people to realize how much social media addiciton has come to direct life in USA. Donald Turmp is a huge junkie to memes and trash Internet content / TV content. ===:::

"I’ve lived in the Deep South my whole life.

All around me the church goers have always acted like they are the most persecuted people on the planet, and like no one has suffered as much as Christians.

Going to church as a kid, I was almost immediately turned off because the second you questioned anything you were treated like an outcast it felt like. You weren’t part of the “in group” anymore.

Note: As a kid, the only question I really had was “Why do we act like Judas and the Romans are bad guys for what they did to Jesus?” because in my kid brain I thought that, if it was all God’s plan, then they should not be punished or hated for their actions.

It was more of questioning how we had free will if everything was God’s plan, because those two things contradict each other.

It later evolved into questioning things like how are Christians persecuted if people of that faith control pretty much all of Western civilization?

Like… it’s absolutely wild to me, and even as an adult I can’t grasp how people don’t see all the contradictions."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different roder from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means **misleading information -- misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?”
