"It's shocking how quickly the US turned into Russia and it's even more shocking how their own people are cheering for it"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica deployed hard-core mental manipulation starting in March 2013. Several years before the November 2016 election win by Donald Trump. People do not take seriously the behavior changes in USA population. Terse, flippant, dismissive, avoidant of nonfiction. Donald Trump entertainer is valued above nonfiction sincere leaders. People compulsively spend all their free time and spare time insulting, mocking, name-calling, mimicking Donald Trump. Attracted to the total mockery unlike any other area of life. Donald Trump is bigger than all the top 10 video games, all the top 10 films, all the top ten sports events COMBINED in how much people can not resist mocking and insulting the Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People do not want to face up how Saudi Arabia and Mecca operate, how Putin and Surkov use antics politics in Russia, etc. Motivating a population to murder neighbors in Ukraine is no small feat. Being a killer, blood on your hands, is no minor life experience. Russia has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014 and the people of Russia are so programmed and conditioned that it keeps going on and on. USA people have been more and more attracted to, flocking to, self-harm and dehumanization with Trump. The behaviors are in your face. People will not stop mocking, insulting, name-calling,dehumanizing "the others" in USA. Every day, the same attractions. ====:::

"So coverage here in Denmark, is that DR (danish national media) has uncovered a plot with 3 individuals with close ties to Trump, operating in Greenland trying to create false narratives, that would hurt the Greenlandic relationship with Denmark, with the goal of creating a Greenlandic “independence movement” in support of Trump taking over.

It violates several international laws, and will probably hurt ties between Denmark and the US further, unfortunately."

"
> I have no idea why so much of the MAGA-sphere thinks you win arguments by being louder.

It's not about winning arguments. They just want to shut down the opposition so they effectively give up. If you look at US politics right now, it seems to work, too. How many times have you rolled your eyes at something the president did or said in the last DAY and just not engaged because you knew exactly how the conversation would go anyway. I won't pretend I haven't been there."

"Do you know what the hardest thing is though? How fucking exhausting it is. If you have a shred of integrity you'll want to provide evidence for your arguments or takedowns. Rebuffing a single talking point can take hours of research, then more time to digest it and form a cohesive argument. So much time and effort, doing their research for them, and it's exhausting.

These chucklefucks though? They're not burdened with facts or reason. They just stroll in, confidently shout a load of bullshit that feels good or feels right to them, some shit they read on Twitter, then just dip. And people eat that shit up. It's not a level playing field, and the more insidious amongst them know it."

"I'd say that's fair, but lets not pretend like folks here do anything but regurgitate the same talking points."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Original thinking is far overrated. People flock to trending and jump on board bandwagons constantly. The problem is WHAT they flock to. Instead of flocking to authentic goodness values like Malala's reformations of sexual relations in Pakistan, people flock to Donald Trump's anti-education anti-comprehension anti-empathy anti-goodness. People flock to fiction storytelling of Fox News and Donald Trump, not to science and talking points. Same with ChatGTP and GrokAI - the fiction "hallucinations" they produce is incredibly popular with consumers / audiences. People do not see, authentic sharing of factual reality. "Sleep Joe Biden" is not entertaining for audiences, trash Tony Clifton performances by Donald Trump and others ells far more. Sober Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" can't be faced by people addicted to antics politics and fiction. People flock to entertainment, amusement, often LOL LOL LOL at the suffering of other people. Death-wishing draw an audience. The what people repeat is unoriginal and hate-filled. ===:::

"In my experience as a teacher, one of the biggest red flags that someone is going to have a hard time in life is that they struggle to understand analogies, satire, hypotheticals, thought experiments, etc... They simply do not have the capacity to link concepts in any kind of abstract way, or be able to compare and contrast them. Everything is engaged at the most basic straightforward level without any reflection.

A staggeringly large percentage of society lacks this ability."

"Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966. Every person must be able to distinguish fiction from nonfiction, metaphor from fact. ChatGPT / GrokAI and other LLM systems will spin creative fiction that people will treat as nonfiction...

"Well you also gotta remember how much sanewashing conservative media does of Trump. Most of these folks have never seen anything except curated excerpts of his speeches, or screenshots of his "good" (ie: less insane) Tweets on Facebook. Hopefully this actually has people not just look at themselves, but actually look at Trump outside of the small bubble that's been constructed around them.

Side note: I will never stop calling it Twitter, but what even is the new name for a "Tweet" if the channel is branded as "X"? "X posts"? "X'es"?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media specific to a political party, media built around Fox News fiction storytelling, Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" fiction entertainment patterns is toxic to society in total. Neil Postman in 1985 published a book titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about this style of media techniques.
“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 ===:::

"One of Trump's first public displays on his 2016 campaign trail was him blatantly mocking a disabled reporter in mannerisms & speech. They all know bullying so well it comes second nature to them.

I believe that's partly to blame for their blinders here - they truly don't believe "the left" would mock & belittle somebody like that, so they take Newsome at face value.

"I love that it really gives insight to how utterly ignorant these people are...they think he's being truthful because that's how their "dear leader" talks."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts entirely in love with short-messages of trash thinking, Twitter-length mind patterns. This Reddit message is a **celebration of igorance** in August 2025. "how utterly ignorant these people are"... eletronic content celebrationg how Untied States of America has had mindsets altered by the Russian IRA using CA payloads since March 2013. Celebrating that Russia won hearts and minds into meme stupor, Tweet-thinking patterns.
“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in **the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming**, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995 ===:::

Every person age 12 to age 120 must be taught to understand modern informationw warfare that the Ukraine war has been buiilt around.

Like this is apparently one of the deepest and most malicious conspiracies that have ever been concocted in human history, and we’re 100% sure of it enough to make this statement for months. 

But also it’s not so important that it needs to be released immediately.

"Mark my words, the causes stated will def be bunk but politically convenient. Maybe being "woke" causes autism, maybe it's being Muslim or black or being vegan. What ever they state the causes of autism are it'll be bad news for people with autism and whoever participates in the "causes". We can cure your autism by sending you to a camp and restricting the "causes". If you enjoy/manufacture/participate in the causes you are now a criminal and need to go to a separate camp. This all is bad and no one will have their autism cured."

> If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
