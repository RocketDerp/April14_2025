"It's shocking how quickly the US turned into Russia and it's even more shocking how their own people are cheering for it"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica deployed hard-core mental manipulation starting in March 2013. Several years before the November 2016 election win by Donald Trump. People do not take seriously the behavior changes in USA population. Terse, flippant, dismissive, avoidant of nonfiction. Donald Trump entertainer is valued above nonfiction sincere leaders. People compulsively spend all their free time and spare time insulting, mocking, name-calling, mimicking Donald Trump. Attracted to the total mockery unlike any other area of life. Donald Trump is bigger than all the top 10 video games, all the top 10 films, all the top ten sports events COMBINED in how much people can not resist mocking and insulting the Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People do not want to face up how Saudi Arabia and Mecca operate, how Putin and Surkov use antics politics in Russia, etc. Motivating a population to murder neighbors in Ukraine is no small feat. Being a killer, blood on your hands, is no minor life experience. Russia has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014 and the people of Russia are so programmed and conditioned that it keeps going on and on. USA people have been more and more attracted to, flocking to, self-harm and dehumanization with Trump. The behaviors are in your face. People will not stop mocking, insulting, name-calling,dehumanizing "the others" in USA. Every day, the same attractions. ====:::

"So coverage here in Denmark, is that DR (danish national media) has uncovered a plot with 3 individuals with close ties to Trump, operating in Greenland trying to create false narratives, that would hurt the Greenlandic relationship with Denmark, with the goal of creating a Greenlandic “independence movement” in support of Trump taking over.

It violates several international laws, and will probably hurt ties between Denmark and the US further, unfortunately."

"The rot is so deep that the premier of Alberta can openly take trips to Mar-a-Lago to get her marching orders. It's no coincidence that she's pushing the idea of Albertan sovereignty with the end goal of becoming the 51st US state."

"I am not sure Americans are aware of how much the relations to their allies are suffering.

When you speak to Americans, it seems they are completely unaware about how much the relationship to e.g. Canada and Denmark has changed just in the past 6 months."

"
> I have no idea why so much of the MAGA-sphere thinks you win arguments by being louder.

It's not about winning arguments. They just want to shut down the opposition so they effectively give up. If you look at US politics right now, it seems to work, too. How many times have you rolled your eyes at something the president did or said in the last DAY and just not engaged because you knew exactly how the conversation would go anyway. I won't pretend I haven't been there."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion." "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds.

"Do you know what the hardest thing is though? How fucking exhausting it is. If you have a shred of integrity you'll want to provide evidence for your arguments or takedowns. Rebuffing a single talking point can take hours of research, then more time to digest it and form a cohesive argument. So much time and effort, doing their research for them, and it's exhausting.

These chucklefucks though? They're not burdened with facts or reason. They just stroll in, confidently shout a load of bullshit that feels good or feels right to them, some shit they read on Twitter, then just dip. And people eat that shit up. It's not a level playing field, and the more insidious amongst them know it."

"All they can talk about are the talking points that FOX and Newsmax give them. They can’t expand on any of it, they can’t talk without disagreeing because they don’t listen and when they don’t have an answer, they talk louder and say things like “are you kidding me?!” They are simple minded, manipulated people."

"I'd say that's fair, but lets not pretend like folks here do anything but regurgitate the same talking points."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Original thinking is far overrated. People flock to trending and jump on board bandwagons constantly. The problem is WHAT they flock to. Instead of flocking to authentic goodness values like Malala's reformations of sexual relations in Pakistan, people flock to Donald Trump's anti-education anti-comprehension anti-empathy anti-goodness. People flock to fiction storytelling of Fox News and Donald Trump, not to science and talking points. Same with ChatGTP and GrokAI - the fiction "hallucinations" they produce is incredibly popular with consumers / audiences. People do not see, authentic sharing of factual reality. "Sleep Joe Biden" is not entertaining for audiences, trash Tony Clifton performances by Donald Trump and others ells far more. Sober Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" can't be faced by people addicted to antics politics and fiction. People flock to entertainment, amusement, often LOL LOL LOL at the suffering of other people. Death-wishing draw an audience. The what people repeat is unoriginal and hate-filled. ===:::

"I have to admit that I never anticipated this reaction from MAGA. it's not like he's being subtle about what he's doing. But it is going right over their heads."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Incredible that in late August 2025 people are still saying one-line Twitter-think Tweet-thinking that this is all new. That MAGA and Donald Trump just started this year. Recency bias abounds. People in USA have lost all ability to see the forest for the trees that this all started back in year 2013 when behaviors changes started in the population.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The entire world, world stage, is calling USA morons. Americans, "fucking morons". We The People are primarily concerned with the name-calling and which name is trending right now. Instead of addressing the Internet Research Agency media invasion by Russia since March 2013, people just want to give one-line Twitter-length reactions about the situation. No communication of desire to turn the situation around. No gong to the public library to learn Neil Postman's big pile of books on the subject and how we can return to comprehension and understanding instead of just name-calling and one-line Bluesky-length reaction commenting on every social machine. ===:::

In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us.

"In my experience as a teacher, one of the biggest red flags that someone is going to have a hard time in life is that they struggle to understand analogies, satire, hypotheticals, thought experiments, etc... They simply do not have the capacity to link concepts in any kind of abstract way, or be able to compare and contrast them. Everything is engaged at the most basic straightforward level without any reflection.

A staggeringly large percentage of society lacks this ability."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Educating every person age 12 to age 120 on Comparative Mythology and basic familiarity with James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is essential. Learning media ecology is no longer optional in a world of 8 billion people bumping into each other with products shipped across oceans and time zones. "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966. Every person must be able to distinguish fiction from nonfiction, metaphor from fact. ChatGPT / GrokAI and other LLM systems will spin creative fiction that people will treat as nonfiction... The ELIZA effect on a massive society scale. Meme addiction being the common ground for a nation.  ===:::

"Well you also gotta remember how much sanewashing conservative media does of Trump. Most of these folks have never seen anything except curated excerpts of his speeches, or screenshots of his "good" (ie: less insane) Tweets on Facebook. Hopefully this actually has people not just look at themselves, but actually look at Trump outside of the small bubble that's been constructed around them.

Side note: I will never stop calling it Twitter, but what even is the new name for a "Tweet" if the channel is branded as "X"? "X posts"? "X'es"?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media specific to a political party, media built around Fox News fiction storytelling, Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" fiction entertainment patterns is toxic to society in total. Neil Postman in 1985 published a book titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about this style of media techniques.
“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 ===:::

"It’s because the right can’t do humor. Their idea of humor is just using a childish nickname. Satire is actually clever and way above their intelligence level."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : One-line Twitter-think Tweet-length Bluesky-length thinking systems abound. People can not distinguish **oversaturation of humor from absence of humor**. People can't tell information overload from ignroance. People are saturated with memes and trash, the IRA won the information war since March 2013. When people are swiming in a total toxic ocean of junk and trash, they can't recognize it when they are sorrounded by it. A critical concept of media ecology and mob mentality behaivior / mass psychosis comprehension, Surkovian information warfare exploits this.

A society completely uneducated in media ecology. "Amusing Ourselves To Death" as defined by Neil Postman in his 1985 book, New York University. This is a nation (since year 2014) of media addicts in meme stupors being lead by Donald Trump, media addict.

"One of Trump's first public displays on his 2016 campaign trail was him blatantly mocking a disabled reporter in mannerisms & speech. They all know bullying so well it comes second nature to them.

I believe that's partly to blame for their blinders here - they truly don't believe "the left" would mock & belittle somebody like that, so they take Newsome at face value.

TL;DR - they're illiterate morons with no worldly thoughts beyond "red hat good"."

"A decent chunk of the humor is slurs and various -isms. There's a reason that the right wing comedians are the ones that bitch they're being silenced and that comedy is *illegal* now. Naw, turns out that if you just make a funny gay joke that isn't "Wow how about these slurs, huh?" you get laughs from people that grew up past a grade school level of humor where the only thing you needed to do to get a laugh was say a slur"
