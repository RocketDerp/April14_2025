"If any of us woke up daily to find a series of overnight nonsensical rants from our 79-year old grandpa, we'd be talking about what this means for his mental health, the need for some level of assisted living, and would see it as a transition point for our aging loved one. But no, not Americans, we're letting grandpa run the country. Make that make sense."

Elon Musk does not have dementia. Tucker Carlson does not have dementia. The entire cast of Fox News fiction, Putin and Surkov, do not have dementia. Denial abounds that USA has lost an information war since March 2013.   
"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, **creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  (2nd) “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ===:::

"Our frail sundowning President acting just like a swath of our elderly population posting drivel on social media. Problem is that this elderly person has his own social media platform and the nuclear codes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Eating the Surkovian onions. complete and total denial of Russian information warfare and public relations techniques](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). This isn't just one single person, Donald Trump, behaving this way, and they are not all elderly. Reddit itself is full of the same absurd surreal fiction. Donald Trump playuing Tony Clifton has audience reactions like this one, declaring it is just a single bad performer and not a blend of scripted and improv audience (Truth Social) interactions. Entertainment addiction, mocking the entertainers, driving society. ===::

"He's a useful idiot for those actually in charge. They can push the envelope further and further, instituting more and more of their heinous dreams, and at the end of the day get to wash their hands of it if there ever even comes to be any backlash, because they can just blame Trump for everything. Their supporters will continue to support them regardless, and nothing changes except the US gets dragged further and further into a dystopia."

"But they read their stupid fucking hackery of tales, of over 2,000 years, a book called the…. Bible, it says “but of these three, faith Hope and love, …love is the most important”

I’m preeeety sure they have never actually read it.

Bible is a crazy read, but I wish they would just follow what they think they believe."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Let it be known taht social media has seen the Bible literacy problem and comments on it over and over for the past 10 years around Trump. yet, social media does not make an effort to use social media itself to organize teachings and lessons. Such as Bible verse "1 John 3:17" being taught over and over until all people age 12 to age 120 in USA can recite the verse and apply it to Doanld Trump and Elon MOsk DOGE behaviors, etc. Social media is not willing to face up that social media itself is driven by mocking and insulting MAGA and Trump (playing Tony Clifton)... spare time and free time in service to mockery and not using social machine systems to organize thoughtful positive reformation of understanding. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "subtlety anymore" - was the Wall against Mexico that was promised for first term *subtle*? Media addicts have extreme recency bias and think that Donald Trump has been subtle for a few day and that is all the timeline analyzed. Was naming his media platform "Truth Social" February 21, 2022 subtle?  ===:::

"The fact that anyone believes anything a MAGA official says is bonkers to me. Like Johnson saying that the Epstein list *must* be released hours after voting to keep it covered up. The distances they will travel to keep faith in the cult in the face of glaring counter-evidence are unfathomable"

&nbsp;

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Attraction to fiction content. Fiction is way more popular than nonfiction and Donald Trump + Putin have created a network of fiction governing systems and values. The audience has been flocking to the total mockery of Trump playing Tony Clifton character. A population entirely engaged in mocking and insulting how terrible and bad Tony Clifton is as President of the United States of America. "The fact that anyone believes anything a MAGA official says is bonkers to me." - fiction addicts don't care to study and understand nonfiction. Comprehension isn't the media consumer concern, entertainment and amusement and stimulation by Trump is the attraction. ===:::

"
> Steven King couldn't have written a character this demented.

Every single excellent writer couldn't write this character because he's so unbelievable. You have to make your characters seem believable on some level or else the watcher gets bored/annoyed.

Even documentaries tone down characters because they know they would lose people if they told the whole truth."

"Yes and all it takes is him ignoring everything again, his party just rolling with it and his stacked SCOTUS signing it off. You’d think they care at this point? I’m not so sure. It’s also a long ass time until 2028 if you look at what he‘s already done in just the past few months.

Prior behavior also play a role because he already mentioned it multiple times and even has hats with Trump 2028 in his stupid gift shop. If anything people should have learned that Trump doesn’t fucking ‚joke‘ and doesn’t ‚just troll the libs‘, he actually means it when it’s about stuff like this. He has proven this behavior time and time again."

Becaue people do not grasp that mocking and insulting Tony Clifton playing the President of the United States (Trump playing Clifton acts) is not resisting. Mocking Trump is not resisting Trump, it's exactly what Surkovian governing does to engage everyone. A mockey of nonfiction, mockery of science, mockery of reality itself in favor of fiction adudience addictions. ===:::
