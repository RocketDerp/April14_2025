When did empathy become so polarizing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : QUESTION: "When did empathy become so polarizing?"
ANSWER: Joseph Campbell lessons for Star Wars audiences filemed by George Lucas in summer of 1986: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, ‚ÄúThou shalt not kill.‚Äù Then the next chapter says, ‚ÄúGo into Canaan and kill everybody in it.‚Äù That is a bounded field. **The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word ‚Äúgentile‚Äù ‚Äî the person is not of the same order." (see also Islamic "infidel", Christian "non-believer" terms to match up "gentile") ===:::

"I was raised to be honest regardless of how negative the outcome might be. I was raised to take ownership of my actions, for good or ill. I was raised to value intelligence and critical thinking, to learn and accept when I am proven wrong so that I may grow but to also drink deeply from the well of knowledge because it is infinite. I was raised to show empathy to those less fortunate than myself.

These were the lessons my parents taught me. Though I frequently fall short, I still strive to live by them.

My father betrayed every single one of them and he did so readily.

On one hand, the argument could be made that AM radio and Fox News lobotomized him over time and robbed him of his higher faculties....but that would absolve him of voluntarily submitting himself to the propaganda in the first place.

On the other, the argument could be made that the man who raised me was a mask and what I see now is who he has always actually be. That, perhaps, he has always been an anti-intellectual and bigot but never felt comfortable enough or had the courage to let the mask drop fully and is, instead, keen to rally behind the physical embodiment of his poisonous thoughts.

Neither ultimately matter to me, in the end.

I've said repeatedly elsewhere: I don't care why, I only care that he has.

I alternate between being embarrassed or wrathfully ashamed to even know him.

But what I have made explicitly clear to him is that I will never forgive him. It's not that I won't: I can't. He thought I was joking when I told him that all the way back in last November of 2025 after the election was called. Given how infrequently we talk now and given his surprise when I told him flatly, "I don't care if you leave me a dime when you pass, I just want your will iron clad so I don't have to waste my time or money fighting your other two sons in in court", that smug chuckle of amusement has grown into silence.

It's a pity we have to teach our parents the lesson of permanence."

Meanwhile he just murdered a boat full of people using little to no evidence, should probably get charged by the ICC for that, and is wasting billions of taxpayer dollars by painting a wall on the southern border (a well known construction accounting trick that criminals use to extract huge amounts of money) and fired all the administrative judges that ICE would be using to get warrants after having blocked a bill that would surge the number of those same judges.

If you just showed up at your father's house with a blowtorch and told him to wait and see and then started setting things on fire he'd call the police pretty fast, if not just shoot you. Meanwhile Trump is setting the future of this country on fire and we're just supposed to "wait and see" "

This is going to play internationally as DO NOT GO TO THE US, not even for business travel. Considering international tourists are crashing, now expect business travel to crater as well. Not to mention a lot more reluctance on the part of international companies to set up factories in the US.

This is nightmare stuff for international companies. Even the threat of getting arrested by ICE is a huge turnoff."

"I mean in fairness, America has always done that throughout its history slandering whomever is considered the enemy or in the way. Its just that nowadays anyone who doesnt actively kiss the boot constantly is considered an enemy or against Americans in some contrived way."

"Krasnov obediently follows orders from his master Putin - in exactly the same way he expects everyone else to be loyal to him.

All Russian agents hate America."
