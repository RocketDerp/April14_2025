"When I hear some fat fucking illiterate in an F-250 screech about protecting children, I can't help but wonder if he's a wannabe predator putting on a show."

"I reckon they will settle into a state where the conservative talking heads will be the face of the administration. They're the ones with the support, and they'll carry water for whatever agenda the Whitehouse pushes.

I seriously think it will only be a slight realignment to reach this state, and the base will go along. If you're American, you should be really worried about this outcome."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People in USA go along with 'talking heads', the media content, on critical health care insurance / measles and other diseases. This is an abandonment of science in favor of fiction media network addictions. Media of mocking and insulting the out-groups is driving behaviors. Reddit and Bluskey addicts mock away at hundreds of millions / MAGA population, not just one man Trump. ===:::

"I think people are too high on the hopium.

There is evidence he is unwell, but no evidence he is catching up with his mate Jeffery. He has access to some of the best medical care in the world - you know, the health care paid for by the people he is removing health care from"

"With respect, I think you have it backwards. The wealthy and powerful have been honing their playbooks to inflame their Konfederacy of Kooks: the uber-religious, the anti-vaxers, Christian nationalists, isolationists, racists and gun nuts (I've probably missed a few). All of those groups are essentially single issue, and will vote in lockstep with whatever party addresses their concerns.

What's also obvious is that none of those groups have any concerns that will actually affect the truly wealthy and powerful of this country. Does anyone actually think that the Thiels/Murdochs/Trumps/Kochs/Mercers of this country are going to let one of us poors open carry a gun in their presence, that those families are going to stop vaccinating their kids, or that they give a fuck about paper coffee cups?

The rich people are calling the shots in a way that gets them what they want (tax cuts and breaks for the rich and corporations) and that will only affect the poors(all of us) negatively. The dog is wagging the tail here, not the other way around."
