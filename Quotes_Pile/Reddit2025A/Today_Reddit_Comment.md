"Ever notice how all these "I swear I'm not a Republican, I always try listening to both sides" celebrities only come out with these "we should support the president regardless of party" and "I'll pray for the president because if he succeeds, then our country succeeds" statements when a Republican is president? Funny coincidence."

"Read his excuse for supporting his cousin in law RFK Jr. Something like - he's a real good guy. We don't talk politics at family gatherings. Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?

Here's the thing Chris. Your Cousin has said vaccines are harmful. When confronted - he claims he said no such thing. Now, he's promoting anti vaxx policies. No need to trust the media or even talking to him."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?" -- which media? media ecology? Which date? Which idea? Where is your webspage showing where the media said fiction. Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Was it fan fiction about your movies? And you think media is the only creator of fiction. Name *one single person* in the entire world, of over 8 billion people, who is perfectly accurate and never ever confuses fiction with nonfiction? **PLEASE... name them, who is accurate and perfect in nonfiction**? Donald Trump can't tell fiction from nonfiction consistely does not comrpehend nonfiction. ===::::

"Considering he literally lived in a van on government assistance and has intimated many times that he prayed his way to success.

That means the "losers" aren't doing enough praying.

Is that about right?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We do not educate people in the most basic facts. Exactly HOW MANY people can be household names? How many people can be famous stars? How many people can have the lead role in a film? how many people can win the olympics? How many can win the FIFA World Cup? It is a maths issue. Every person who is injured in sports or missed a job interview thinks that they would get the job, egoism. A lack of seeing the forest for the trees. How MANY bestselling books of the century can there be? How many number 1 songs can be number 1? Just because something is popular doesn't mean it is an ideal. People go through life thinking they should all marry the same spouse beacause they are the most beautiful ranked. So should Jennifer Lawrence have 8 million husbands? That's who purcahses her movie tickets! Since the comment mentions Jesus Christ prayer... The Bible, of 2000 yeas ago, has a math lesson: Matthew 25:40 - you can't all be NUMBER ONE, the 1 out of 100. You are supposed to pay attention to the most challenged person, the "least of these" Matthew 25:40 ===::::
