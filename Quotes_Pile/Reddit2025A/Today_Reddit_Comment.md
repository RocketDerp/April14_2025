"Not just your country. I'm in fucking Canada and out of 6 immediate neighbours 3 are Maple MAGA and are all women.

I made the mistake of bringing up politics with one the other day...    
*"Oh I love what Trump is doing down there. He's a hero, we need someone like that in Canada"*   
*"Why don't you move down to the States then?"* -me   

F%#$ing irony is that she's on disability and benefitting from a long list of social services which would be the first to be cut under a Trumplike regime.   
I keep saying that MAGA is not a problem unique to America: similar parties and sentiments are rising worldwide. Even darker days are ahead."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The MAGA "movement" is not unique to USA, and people keep ignoring that Putin and Trump are best buddies and working together. The Internet Research Agency worked with Cambridge Analytica as agreed by Trump in November 2012 to alter the minds and behaviors of ALL PEOPLE.
"Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.", "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа.", "Дальше оставалось только загрузить эти данные в информационные потоки и социальные сети."
We have HARD VALIDATED FACTUAL EVIDENCE going back **to year 2014** disclosed to We The People, the public world wide: "It examined thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017. Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a "wedge issue", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University." - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 ===:::

"I’m not an expert but I believe the concept of Karma would suggest that Trump will suffer in a future life, not that he would face punishment in this one.

It’s a nice thought."

"There is also the historic example of Hitler, Mussolini or Kadafi. Unfortunate that they dragged a lot of people to the grave before them. Let’s see if America truly is the special country we claim we are and how far we will be dragged before it’s gets stopped in its tracks. I remember, a long time ago, in high school history classes thinking “ how did the German people let that happen?”. It’s becoming a haunting thought now when I can see how easily it’s happening here and how meaningless the word “American” can become with so much un-American activity being condoned by supposedly very self declared American Patriots."

"If you talk like a Russian agent, and act like a Russian agent, and supports all the things a Russian agent would support … then it doesn’t actually matter whether you’re actually a Russian agent or not!"

"This is another example of TDS making liberals dumb. If anything the EU and all of their leaders are Russian assets. They are continuing to help fund Russia's invasion of Ukraine with their purchases of Russian oil and gas. How much is the US buying? None"

"There was one 10 minute video where he shows his written manifesto. I read it was uploaded "right before the shooting"'. I watched the whole video on Twitter but it didn't specify a time or anything like that.

I'm also not sure how true it is that they'd be posting about this for months. Their social media got taken down before their name was public."

"This only further confirms my theory - with foreknowledge of the attack, the FBI had plenty of time to create a fake paper trail for the name change and a fake manifesto... Then they allow the attack to happen and spin the narrative that he was trans..."
