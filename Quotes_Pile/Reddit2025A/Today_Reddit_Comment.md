"Trump sees geopolitics as a group of personal relationships. China is just xi. Russia is just Putin. He can‚Äôt understand geopolitics and strategy.

Why is China doing this right now Donald? Why are they showing the world their military and cooperation? Hmm. Let‚Äôs think. Because it stands in stark contrast to you!"

"This very statement by Trump is meant to instill fear and a sense of isolation in Americans. Don't fall for it. Classic abuser behavior."

"There is a good chance he and the GOP start railing against Asians after the anti Latino rhetoric runs its course and loses effectiveness when rubes start to realize the economy and cost of living hasn't improved a few years from now"

"China sells Trade, USA under Trump sells bullying and sanctions. It's not rocket science why this shift is happening"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length tiny short thinking, thought-terminating "not rcoket science". Out of millions of possible leaders for USA, why Donald Trump? People are completly ignoring the Russian media invasion since March 2013. The detachment from reality isn't just Donald Trump, is the population. Military loss of hearts and minds to self-harm USA and *hate harder* faith systems. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

"We're in the post-truth era. Facts and reality don't matter anymore, only what we wish to believe is true or feels good, fake news is whatever we wish to believe isn't true, and no one has time anymore to bother with fact checking. And it's only going to get worse with AI.

Welcome to the brave new world."

"Bill Burr said it better: libraries have the decency to at least categorize things as true and not true."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We are unwilling to face up that Torah / Bible / Quran are in their own special section and not moved to science fiction. Star Wars and Bible are both science fiction storytelling. Quran is a retcon of The Bible: Moses / Adam / Eve / Mary / Jesus / Noah are all in Mohammad's Quran some 600 years later. Book of Mormon year 1830 also a retcon of The Bible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon ===:::

"Since Trump tries to flood the zone with shit and divert media's attention to something else, this might be a good strat to keep the Epstein list in the news for longer period of time, in every news cycle."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Information Strip Tease. The cultivated QAnon / Q / Pizzagate audience is sitting and waiting on the fedreal goverment. Obdient media consumers. "Since Trump tries to flood the zone with shit", Netflix and HBO Max and Disney Plus do the same with *fiction shit*. So does the Church, which lead Europe for hundreds and hundreds of years using fiction. Surkov won, Russia won, since March 2013. ===:::

"My question is what happens when the names are out. Like let‚Äôs saw the names come out and we get someone like Trump front and center. Then what? Is anybody going to actually hold him accountable? Is he going to be removed from power?

Or is everyone just going to clutch their pearls and go ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs wild‚Äù while continuing to enable him?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People are attracted to the private jet lives of the rich and famous TV personalities / media stars. Supporting Malala with free time and spare time on social media addresses the underlying problem on a global basis of young girls being exploited by elderly men who bamboozle with fiction. Alas, social media users with spare time are far more attracted to the rich men's sex games and media content.

"I fucking hate that man"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : That's the very basis of Trump's power. Playng Tony Clifton gets this 5-word Twitter-length conditioned thinking, over and over. This has been ongoing for over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, that social media addicts jump on their touchscreen machines to declare that Donald Trump is the power of hate. Organized hate media. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S8wllPmazM ===:::
