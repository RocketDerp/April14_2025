"Suicide by cult. She’s not the first, nor will she be the last."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Cults of memes, cults of anti-science, cults of fiction stories. Those who die for Quran and Mecca and Mosque, Islamic Terrorists, are suicide by science fiction storytelling cult. That is what Putin and Trump and Cambridge Analytica mastered since March 2013. And we must educate every person age 12 to age 120 in the entire world on media ecology and comparative mythology (science fiction history, monomyth vs. monomyth story patterns in human mind) to defend against the self-destruction. 5,000 patterns of science fiction alternate reality were deployed by Russia: "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа." - https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446 ===:::

"This is a disgrace - she became radical and does NOT deserved this honor. She failed to see Trump administration as the Domestic Enemy they are. Out constitution warned us about “Enemies Foreign and Domestic” we are here! Stock up on 2nd Amendment supplies and soon make a choice wish side you will stand on - as a progressive Democrat myself - I will stand on the right side of history!"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I suggest stocking up on "sober up from enertainment" 1st ammendment supplies and start distributing them *yesterday*. Cult deprogramming instructions and education, teachings about media ecology, teachings about mob mentality and  "MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M - and study Russian information warfare and defend against Putin techniques. ===:::

"It is absolutely sped up for the first part of the video until she is close to going off the road. How can you not tell this is sped up just by looking at her head movement? Her head looks like it is being fast forwarded, because it is. You can also look at the time in the bottom right corner, the seconds are going up much faster all the way until 22:10 where it then goes to normal speed because she’s about to go off road.

This isn’t an argument, it is objectively, 100% sped up. Multiple things make that very obvious."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Meme addicts to hyper reality and entertainment content can not distinguish reality itself. They are avoidiant of nonfiction reality, not attracted to analyzing and learning about relevant society reality of media addiction behaviors (the car driver is a hyperreal media addict too, like the Reddit audience members aboidant of reality). ===:::

"LOL I had no problem admitting I was wrong. I need evidence, though, which I wasn’t getting.

And right now I have 40 redditors pissed off over…. Nothing lol. It’s a lot more fun to watch them wrap themselves in knots and turn purple trying to tell me I’m wrong and it is *very* enjoyable watching them get even angrier when I simply refuse to do what they want me to do over something so low stakes lmfao."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Donald Trump society role model playing Tony Clifton enjoying the audience interaction. "LOL" opening of message, "lmfao" closing.  The very posting on Reddit is a media addict, and an audience media addict wants "very enjoyable" to be preadatory on media addicts. A culture driven by media addiction, society of Donald Trump media addicts, who can't get enough of supporting that Donald Trump provides constant topic of insulting and attacking. MAGA values, media addiction, nation. Fox News is fiction, Donald Trump provides fiction, a society driven by fiction vs. fiction conflicts. ===:::

"You already answered your own implied question: They don't think. I know so many people that view everything from the standpoint of what they gain from an action, not what they RISK with an action. It's a fundamentally different mindset, and chasing dopamine is DESIGNED to make you not think about consequences. Thinking about things in terms of risk FORCES you to think about things, because the first thing you are going to think is: I don't like risk. How do I make risk go away? And now you're thinking about it..."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It isn't accidental.  It is a plot to enslave the meme addict population into constant high-speed reactions to leaders / wealth lords. All [the technology companies in USA are converging with the White House](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/03/25/many-silicon-valley-figures-saw-donald-trump-s-election-as-an-opportunity_6739484_19.html) / Kremlin leadership.
“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, 2019 ===:::

"Gross generalization:

This is why MAGA thinks everyone needs super strong laws and policing for everything. They personally lack self control and will selfishly do illegal things anytime, anywhere, as long as they think they won’t get caught. Therefore they think everyone else secretly thinks just like them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Not unqiue to MAGA / USA. Dog eat dog thinking values. Anti-compassion, anti-empathy, outsmart others. Every area of life is competition to manipulate and trick other people out of their wealth and power. "People living in competitition", "take a look ahead!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edwk-8KJ1Js ===:::

"It’s amazing how badly these people want to stay in power. How badly they want people to work harder to earn so little and so the people from up top can stay in their ivory tower. How much they’re willing to risk so no one knows about how little they truly care for their own country and her people. I’m glad this is coming up and I’m glad this information is being spread so we all know that their shit stinks"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction addiction can rule populations. Nonfiction science is considered boring, Donald Trump provides fiction. Fox News provides fiction. Bible story of science fiction. Far more motivationg and popular. ===:::
