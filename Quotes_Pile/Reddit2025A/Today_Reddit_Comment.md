"If any of us woke up daily to find a series of overnight nonsensical rants from our 79-year old grandpa, we'd be talking about what this means for his mental health, the need for some level of assisted living, and would see it as a transition point for our aging loved one. But no, not Americans, we're letting grandpa run the country. Make that make sense."

Elon Musk does not have dementia. Tucker Carlson does not have dementia. The entire cast of Fox News fiction, Putin and Surkov, do not have dementia. Denial abounds that USA has lost an information war since March 2013.   
"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, **creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  (2nd) “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ===:::

"Yep yet MAGA Cultists act like he's perfect"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Study the Bible, it is poetry fiction. Cults of media around a media star. Information cults. The unique style and tone of the fiction attracts compusive cult addictio. Fox News audience behaves as if Fox News storytelling is perfectly fine nonfiction. ===:::

Nowadays I can't even read the article because it's pay walled and all the top comments are mostly other people who also did not read the article"

"I was checking to see what was being posted while he was dead. It was just a bunch of AI slop on X, one of them was a bunch of spliced AI slop of him in various ages. One of the scenes was him looking like he was a decorated military officer, it was bizarre."
