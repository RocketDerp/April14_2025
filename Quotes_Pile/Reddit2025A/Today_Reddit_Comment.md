"No, they are connected to how many people were killed that were working for western organizations. Last time there was an apology was the WCK bombing. Now the journalists that were killed were working for western publications."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users could be organizing sending thousands of inexpensive smartphoens with SD cards to haeve *everyday people* record video of events and have multiple people show what is happening. In an information war - document how people are starving and being bombed. Organize pickup locations for SD cards every 12 hours and a system to publish the videos from Amman Jordan or other neary by Internet stable location. This has been going on since October 2023 and social media society is not organizing to show thousands of indepenent *non-professional* people given a democratic voice in the situation. People are not asserting Malala's excellent ideas about terrorism on social media. Instead, people react to Israel over and over and over, reactionary thinking. Anti-progress thinking. Social media society has all the signs of beig media addicted to the daily news events and not actually haing copassion for EVERYDAY people being given voice like Malala's focus on EVERYDAY people being given voice through education and stable information systems (stable education / learning systems). ===:::

"The consequences are they lost their moral high ground forever now. Every time going forward there's a 'oh the holocaust' people will parallel it to what Israel is doping in Gaza. People are realising this has been going on, to a lesser extent than today, but for the last 70 years.

From what they are doing now Israel will lose a bunch of global support, possibly even USA over time. While they enjoy a powerful position in ME today, without big brother to arm and defend them things could really change over the longer term.

From that even with ethics and humanitarian reasons aside, this has been a horrible decision by Netanyahu, They get a little more land but the people will always be on the other side of the fence and now their global support will shrink."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think media addicts are entertained by horror films, wars footage, video of suffering, photographs of others suffering and being terrorized. Content creation is what many people favor over compassion and love. Addicts to media reacting to every event of war, not calling for Malala's **nonfiction** solutions to end war - but instead react-commenting on Reddit and other media platforms and media systems keeps audiences glued to streaming information devices. ==:::

"To me one of the most chilling parts of 1984, and one that to me explains a lot of the conservative/authoritarian mindset, is when O'Brien explains to Smith that making someone else suffer is the only way to make sure you have power over them: after all, how can you know you are imposing your will on someone else if they just comply? For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them. That is the point of cruelty for its own sake as weaponized by conservatives ans authoritarians."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This was a core focus of the Russian IRA: [Gatov, who is the former head of Russia's state newswire's media analytics laboratory, told BuzzFeed the documents were part of long-term Kremlin plans to swamp the internet with comments. "Armies of bots were ready to participate in media wars, and the question was only how to think their work through," he said. "Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers."](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america) - same goes for social media users. Get people addicted to fiction. This problem (crisis) is not in any way unique to the Republican party and United States of America - it is a human brain issue globally. Fiction outsells nonfiction. "The media" includes Reddit, memes and tarsh content, Bluesky trash content.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to **instill chaos through society** so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ... ... ...

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes, **the plan, the plot to break America** was spelled out in a 2019 book, way back in year 2019:
“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"It's clear there has been a generational misunderstanding of what ‘conservatism’ is, and it’s because conservatives have been allowed to define themselves with this bait and switch where they have convinced people ‘real’ conservatism is about fiscal responsibility, constitutional reverence, free markets or ‘being cautious’. Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.

Conservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order**. That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.

They like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order. Once you understand this all their bullshit makes sense."

"I think you might be getting your hopes up a bit too much. American Fascism won't die with Trump. The same people who are killing America today will still have the same power structures in place; they still have tens of millions of people, including your MAGA neighbours, whose entire life is consumed by Trumpian cruelty and violence, and who wouldn't think twice about sending you to a death camp. Yes, some cults die with their founders, but this one is putting the structures into place at this very moment so that this doesn't happen. Scientology didn't die with Hubbard. The North Korean regime is flourishing as much as ever under its third Kim. Yes, Kim-Jong Un doesn't have the charisma or leadership skills that his grandfather and father had, but he doesn't have to - because Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il made sure to put the structures into place for their regime to go on indefinitely, or at least until they have killed every last North Korean citizen.

Right now Hegseth is replacing top generals with fascist leaders, right now the new ICE Gestapo is flush with $170 billion to put you under the yoke of the regime, right now troops are being moved into your cities, right now there are armed checkpoints in your nation's capital to control the movement of citizens, right now the media is being threatened into full government compliance, right now your elections are being rendered meaningless, right now the jackbooted thugs of the regime are doing raids of citizens' homes to put fear into them. All of that will continue and get worse whether Trump is there or not. If anything, the violence and the cruelty will get stepped up a notch upon his departure, while the new regime makes sure to maintain its stranglehold on the flimsy remains of American democracy.

The window of opportunity for fighting back is right now, and it's closing rapidly. There is zero chance that you will have meaningful midterm elections next year if you let this rotten filth fester any further, Trump or no Trump. There is zero chance that the bubble will burst on its own or that you get saved by a deus ex machina ending. Putting your hopes into the fact that Trump is a demented imbecile with rapidly declining health is a dangerous and ultimately fruitless gamble."

People saying this on Reddit in August 2025 don't even recognize that Donald Trump is playing Tony Clifton, the answer of *more satire* to Tony Clifton peformance is a complete failure to grasp the situation at hand (since March 2013). This is Surkov governing that has worked for Putin for 25 years! People can't even recognize it. Mocking is not resisting, mocking Tony Clifton is exactly the intended outcome of the performance. Surkov governing is based on this deepest exploit of the human mind. ===:::
