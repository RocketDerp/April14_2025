"There's gotta be an element of extreme cognitive dissonance involved. I refuse to believe that close to 50% of voters are ok with child abuse.

In order to beat them, you need to understand them. They just truly, honestly somehow believe it's a conspiracy and lies. They've lied to themselves that thoroughly.

That's why arguing with them about it seems like you're arguing against a brick wall. Because to them you are spouting nonsense. That's what they hear."

And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time. Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics." - December 31, 2014 - more than a decade ago. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html ===:::

A lot of mythos around tech billionaires is way overstated in general but many of them at least actually did build something. Ballmer was just an early employee that rose to the top of an already very successful company and his wealth is predicated not only on the working class like many others but on other people's visions as well."

More than that, though, its that people do not understand the system, don't care to learn, and just accept it is what it is and try to figure out how to fill their lives with copes and distractions enough to deaden the pain of failure and apathy.

"This is a blinkered view of political analysis. It's not a "purity test" or egotistical to evaluate the political valence of a particular political party in a world historical perspective. With your framework,  it's impossible to say that the dominant political parties have drifted rightwards. 

Saying up vs down is more accurate is absurd. There are plenty of right wing narratives that use this format and they are 100% wrong."

"Once upon a time, we built a system of Enlightenment reasoning and discussion. If you refrained from participating in that, if you insisted on telling bald-faced lies that nobody including yourself actually believed, if you did not respect evidence, if you were openly predatory, you were professionally ostracized, personally shunned, reviled, no benefit of the doubt granted. It was a matter of honor, of basic social conduct. It was justification for reprisal. Either you're somebody we can have a conversation with, or you're a dangerous lunatic who infringed on our society that we must be rid of as soon as possible.

"Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself" said your senior leadership.

Yes sir, said you. And then went to post about how they might not have your best interest in mind on Reddit.

These aren't beliefs, they're thin pretenses. He doesn't believe these stories that he is telling literally. Your boss isn't telling you he doesn't believe in inflation, he's telling you "Fuck you! And don't you dare say another word about your pathetic weakness to me. I'm a winner, I deserve it because of who I am!"

Your response to that can be varying degrees of violent or procedural, but it absolutely needs to become malicious and effective if you are to survive in this world."

"It certainly does. I like having healthy political discussions with my dad as we are quite opposite when it comes to a lot of recent issues.

He mentioned to me he was listening to a podcast (can’t remember which one) and they were talking about how the real reason Russia invaded Ukraine was because of NATO encroachment that went against established treaties.

He explained he is anti-Russia but could understand this justification, at least.

I had to explain to him how that is purposefully misleading half truth that leaves out all the treaties Russia repeatedly broke which led NATO trying to expand its influence.

He’s one of the smartest people I know and he even fell for the propaganda initially, before knowing the full context."

"People seem to lack any kind of comprehension of how methodically social media has been gamed. People think it's just some bad actors like Russia or China doing this. Plenty of groups within America are involved in disinformation.

Please remember that just because their is a name and maybe a face, that you have no idea if that is an actual person. They still barely try to hide these accounts because so many people lack any form of critical thinking skills.

Part of the solution, as I see it, is to unplug. Stop watching TV. This is why they're actively attacking unbiased sources like NPR and other public news sources. "Liberal bias" is such a scam. Big business owns 98% of media both traditional and non. They control the narratives based on money. The same can be said about places like reddit.

― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985. Apply that to **meme machines**, smartphones / iPhone / iPad too. As much as we worry about labeling things as NSFW / adult content, we should be worried about fact-checking validation. Every bit of information could have a protocol for fact-checking. Every sentence ever created could be tied to a Wiki style system. Instead, we mock and avoid nonficiton and insult those who provide citations and name-drop authors who expound on complex subjects. Donald Trump and RFK Jr are *entertaining* as Neil Postamn described, people enjoy mocking and insulting Trump and RFK Jr. Total mockery of nonfiction with citations and references. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Regardless of humor or sarcasm. Twitter think logic. Without violence, there is nothing ever changed. I guess society moved from books to Internet sites like Reddit in the past 20 years because of violence! A statement of unreality that is a message of pro-violence encouragment. ===:::

"I’m glad to see other people upset by this because I’m honestly affronted by the lowering of the flag for a right wing media head.

The flag should really only be lowered for high ranking officials or in remembrance of a national tragedy.

Today there was also a shooting at a school in Colorado but the flag wasn’t lowered for that. It’s normally only lowered for the day of 9/11 and it’s going to be lowered for 4 days one of which covers 9/11?"

"I’m really disappointed by all of the evil on Reddit and this country in general. All of these vitriolic, pious frauds are just as bad as they claim him to be. I did not support Charlie whatsoever, but the true colors of the pseudo empathic community here are showing and I’m just tired of it. Literally proving his quote about empathy to be correct."

"The left and right literally just turn into eachother whenever they have the chance to make fun of the other or make the other look bad.

When the Minnesota lawmakers were murdered the right made so many jokes out of it and made fun of them. Trump said that it wasn’t even worth calling to offer condolences.

But I’m sure now it will be about how awful the left is, just as then it was about how awful the right was

All this is to say we are the same people that fall into the same traps and do the same things over and over. The right thinks the left is evil and the left thinks the right is evil. But they both act the same given the same circumstances"

"I think it’s just mostly Reddit but yeah the disconnection from reality is truly horrifying to see"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : As if Twitter is better than Reddit and Truth Social is better than Reddit, etc. Donald Trump was elected a second term in office. I have been around elderly in Florida and Arizona since Trump took office, it isn't just children on Reddit. The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica manipulated USA population into self-harm since March 2013. The pandemic COVID-19 anti-science self-harm and anti-humanism was induced by Russian hybird warfare on social media with evidence going back to yeaer 2014 (start of Ukraine war): https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - we in year 2025 still have anti-science pro-disease mindsets about measles that were disclosed August 24, 2018 - people are widespread LOL amused at deaths and self-harm of those they disagree with (Americans hate upon Americans). It wasn't like this before the IRA media invasion. Trump attracts people with faith in hate, machine dehumanization / systemic dehumanization. ===:::

"Really, really disgusting people on this app. Truly evil & I hope each& every one of them finds the help they need in this life"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : As if Twitter is better than Reddit and Truth Social is better than Reddit, Facebook better than Reddit, etc. People only see tree and not the forest of the situation and how long it has been gong on. The USA is in self-harm mindsets. Not just *one* media platform, media community. It's in the White House with elders who did not *grow up* on Reddit and YouTube. ===:::

"It only adds to the depression too when you realize the people supposedly on your side are so brutally unforgiving. The political landscape is an absolute mess, I honestly can't see how we get out of this anymore. Look at all the downvotes you're accumulating for being a sensible person. We're cooked."

"I know you're completely right, but I'm still somewhat infuriated that we all have to be terrified when Melissa Hortman and others were assassinated in their homes and the media and Republicans did everything they could to sweep it under the rug.

It just saddens me that when we are fearful, we get mocked, and when they are fearful we know that likely more people are at risk of being hurt."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Faith in mocking. Mockery is proven. Donald Trump mocks science, and Bluesky and Reddit moock back. People are not counting up that ALL SIDES agree: 1) hate harder, 2) mock harder. A total mockery. People who mock Donald Trump (playing Tony Clifton) are not RESISTING Donald Trump. Mocking Trump is doing exactly what Trump represents: faith in mocking itself. Mocking reality. Putin / Surkov / Russian techniques that has worked for 25 years in domestic Russia and exported since March 2013 by the IRA. ===:::
