"At this point he could live broadcast video showing him being a necrophilic pedo cannibal and his base would either claim it's AI or that Democrats are somehow worse.

There is no bottom"

"I think people would actually be more upset if he killed a dog than killed a child."

"There are literally tweets of MAGA mothers who said if Trump would rape their daughters they would be upset but they'd still vote for him. It's really far beyond the realm of anything resembling rational thinking.

People like this need to be barred from taking part in elections, for life. The age of the right to vote is over."

"I agree. Also, I'm not sure we care so much about kids in this country, just look at our gun laws. It might be a huge scandal but nothing will change until the general population stops giving in to the rhetoric and demand that everyone be treated with respect and dignity."

"Nah, they don't care. One of the analysts that I listen to often says that Russia uses a "post-truth" propaganda approach. They don't care about secrets because they systematically decrease the value of truth and fight against our ability to believe in anything. They would just spread multiple conflicting rumours on any important subject, until your only option is to believe what you like, not what is supported by evidence."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This is an INCREDIBLY PROVEN system. In The Bible monomyth science fiction story: Matthew / Mark / Luke / John write multiple rumors that becomes a *choose your own adventure* to afterlife heaven rewards story. Extremely compelling and Surkov and Putin mastered this 25 years ago and have adapted it to Reddit / Bluesky / Twitter / meme addict society of USA since March 2013. Create 5,000 variations of Matthew / Mark / Luke / John. My entire repeating repeat repeat repeating media ecology assertions ("Wake Indra" opera) about Surkov / McLuhan / Postman / Campbell / Enter Shikari / Pomerantsev is based on *moving beyond* King Trump / King Putin and this model. ...
"II.4, portraying the drunken and sleeping Earwicker's dream, chronicles the spying of four old men (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) on Tristan and Iseult's journey. The short chapter portrays "an old man like King Mark being rejected and [abandoned by young lovers who sail off into a future](https://youtu.be/2ROK1-VvOQ0?t=182) without him", while the four old men observe Tristan and Isolde, and offer four intertwining commentaries on the lovers and themselves which are "always repeating themselves"." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake ===:::

"So when's all this bad stuff going to happen? No recession, economy is good, border is getting under control and illegals are leaving. I'd say life is a lot better than the last administration wouldn't you?"

"No, it was mostly the economy and while I think Biden did a good job people were still feeling economic pain and she basically said she would just keep doing what he was doing which a lot of people didn't understand had been working. Trump spoke to a lot of people's economic frustrations, and people also remember the economy being better under him at least up until covid (which I would argue was mostly just him riding Obama's coattails but yeah doesn't change people's memories of better times)."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I agree: "Trump spoke to a lot of people's economic frustrations" - that greed and rich people need more. That's the frustrations of Trump media addicts. That the rich people don't make fancy enough films or war footage and things need to be more Reality TV / fiction Internet meme like all the time. Economic frustrations that the wealthy don't get enough free speech. Economic frustrations that Putin can't just take Ukraine and anything he wishes. What good is wealth and power if you can't do everything your nightmares tell you to do? "it was mostly the economy"... no, it is all about entertainment addiction. Trump provides Tony Clifton mockery and hate. The economy of memes, the economy of media content addictions. ===:::

"She was worse than status quo. She was a historically unpopular, gun toting, genocide supporting moderate that campaigned with Republicans. But we were supposed to vote for her because she's black and a woman. The DNC learned the hard way that identity politics and whataboutisms don't win elections."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We The People of Reddit / Bluesky don't ever learn. People act like "learning the hard way" is a proven system of understanding and comprehension. If that were **true true**, then the Middle East would have leanred the hard way how many thousands of years ago? Toxic poluarity is not evidence of popularity being good. Democracy does not work when people toss compassion and love into the trash in favor of meme addictions on Reddit. A meme society unwilling to study media ecology and Russian information warfare thinking this situation is only domestic USA elections and not global information war. Apparently, there isn't enough Trump praising Putin in public for Reddit community to go read nonfiction books about how Russia actually operates. Reddit infiltrated by Kremlin mind-fuck.
[**All of you guys out there in the Middle East are out of the same Melting Pot. And you're all as crazy as a butterfly on absenth**. I don't know whether you're all Canaanites at the base or you're all Jews at the base or out of the land of Nod or whatever the hell you were at the get go. Semites or whatnot, but **you've been fighting there now for something like 8,000 years. And you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and peace. You're forever killing each other and sticking knives at each other and burning babies and the world has had to suffer with this.** Great things have come out of the Middle East. Great things like the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity seems to be your chief export. Stupidity and violence are your cash crops all you. And **this was before September 11th** and I said my solution to the problem in the Middle East is this:](../../Grim_Blunt/Cognitive_Decline_Nation.md#harlan-ellison-middle-east-8000-years) ===:::

"I don’t think people are grasping the gravity of the situation: the tariffs Trump has placed, have already put the farming and steel industry in a very precarious position.

This is the bubble with a needle inches away from popping it. This isn’t a “this will definitely happen in x amount of time!” It’s in the “if a gust of air hits this bubble, there’s a very real and very tangible chance it’s floating not only in the direction of that needle, but directly into it.”

Economically, it would not seem to take a large fumble to set in motion a catastrophe in similar proportions to what happened in 2008.

Very much a “not a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’” "

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I don't think people are grasping the gravity of the situation. Fiction addiction is EVERY DAY all the time, not just the economy. Medical truth is abandoned in favor of Russain fiction storytelling, etc. People are willing to die for fiction stories. EVER DAY, not just election days. This has been gong on since year 2014: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 ===:::
