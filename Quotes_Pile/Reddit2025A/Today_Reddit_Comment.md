My guess is he’s pissed the first one didn’t work because the people didn’t have the guns and the guts or the training and direction. Trump wants the military to be on his side for the next one.

"Please. Americans have allowed it so far, Trump could declare martial war tomorrow and all you'd do is tut and make memes about how evil it is and "we saw this coming!" 

Not trying to be a dick, but It's the most likely response given all his overreach so far. Trump wants a civil war, and he's gonna get a civil war. And every day Americans wait and see is another day he has to prepare for it.

"I think you’re right and yet I’m at a complete loss as to what to do. We’ve had rallies they ignore. We’ve seen protests and seen their escalating response. The most important thing I could do was to vote and I’ve done that.

I have spoken out. Many have spoken out. Good friends, family have ignored it and didn’t care. I’ve lost my father and uncle to this Trump cult and they don’t want to hear it. They call me deranged (TDS). What do you do when speaking up only pushes away the people I’d most like to reach?

I’m so sad that the people I loved held values that they so easily tossed aside. My grandfathers both fought in WW2 against fascism. They put their lives on the line against this, but all of their children fell in line supporting this narcissistic dictator, and they don’t even see it.

I went to a New Year’s party with my uncle last year. One of the gents at the party, my uncle’s good friend was so sad that his wife of 40 years was divorcing him, literally over Trump. They truly don’t care how appalling he is to us and think she’s divorcing him over Trump instead of divorcing the man she loved over his lack of values.

So I ask again, and I’d love to ask this of the children of the Germans who grew up as the Nazis rose to power. How do we effectively stop this?"

"Having talked to servicemen and retired servicemen, the brainwashing and shall we say "reshaping" of people's personalities when they go into the service is troubling, to put it mildly. I get it - you have to make people into effective fighting units that will follow orders without question and be willing to kill or be killed without hesitation. Unfortunately, it takes very little tinkering with that formula to make them all too eager to obey and kill, and very little effort to create new "others" who are the "enemies of freedom" and who need to be killed. Obviously, not all soldiers are like this, and a bit too much exposure to reality snaps some of them out of the supposed glory of violence in the name of one's nation, but in general you can't expect the military to save you from a dictatorship."

"This thread is chock full of ridiculous stereotypes. Everybody acting like they "know" the nerds.

"Mmmactually it was the nerds who were the pricks in high school, not the popular guys"

Was that high school on fucking Mars? The popular people in my high school were vicious assholes. They were getting into fist fights regularly and picking fights with anyone they thought were too weak to fight back.

We had a computer lab where "socially disadvantaged" kids would attend classes but would also practice programming and bounce ideas off each other during free time. Just collaborating and minding their own business. Well the "popular" kids would sometimes come into the lab and physically harass the people using the computers and taunting them. Calling them (said with air quotes by the "cool" kids) "hackers".

"Hey Mike, you going to hack into the FBI mainframe lol" while grabbing their wheeled chairs and flinging them across the room.

Just dumb shit.

Maybe it's because I was in a dying working class hockey town but the "cool" kids fucking sucked and the "nerds" literally weren't hurting anybody. They were probably just trying to get good enough at programming so they could get the hell out of this shitty town.

It seems to be that people are taking the worst examples of silicon valley moguls (who are absolutely off the rails insane) and applying them to people they didn't much care for in high school for what ever reason. The people that have risen to the top of the heap in silicon valley are a rare breed of ruthless sociopaths who just happen to be technically inclined. If you want someone to blame for the situation then blame corporate America. Every industry, whether it's tech or medicine or automotive, rewards the worst of the worst for ruthless short term cost cutting thinking. It's all about making the share holders happy.

The nerds from our high school didn't create this situation. This is late stage capitalism and it's pervasive in every single industry. The tech moguls are the lightning rods for everyone's ire lately because their influence is so all encompassing and they're playing with people's lives by cosying up to fascist elements within the ruling class."

"Behold. The festering carcass of American rot shoved into an ill-fitting suit: the sleaze of a conman, the cowardice of a draft dodger, the gluttony of a parasite, the racism of a Klansman, the sexism of a back-alley creep, the ignorance of a bar-stool drunk, and the greed of a hedge-fund ghoul—all spray-painted orange and paraded like a prize hog at a county fair. Not a president. Not even a man. Just the diseased distillation of everything this country swears it isn't but has always been-arrogance dressed up as exceptionalism, stupidity passed off as common sense, cruelty sold as toughness, greed exalted as ambition, and corruption worshiped like gospel. It is America's shadow made flesh, a rotting pumpkin idol proving that when a nation kneels before money, power, and spite, it doesn't just lose its soul—it shits out this bloated obscenity and calls it a leader."

Our allies see what is happening and the US is starting to take the side of the Authoritarian countries.

"Again, I say. Imagine Obama or Biden smearing wrong-colored makeup on the back of their hand to hide a medical emergency from the public.

Consider that doing it actually INCREASES attention toward it. Not only is it a bruise, something that happens to the human body for mostly normal reasons sometimes, but still curious. But he is literally COVERING IT UP (Poorly). It's literally (Attempted)LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. Is there a greater metaphor?

Back to my original point. If Obama were doing this, it would be front page, top of the broadcast news every day until they hounded it out of his press team. No other message would get out of his administration. Every pundit would debate it in primetime. Every mainstream journalist would investigate his health.

Democracy is gone, and I only hope it's somehow temporary."
