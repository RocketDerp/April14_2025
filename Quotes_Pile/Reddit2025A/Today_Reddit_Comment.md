"We Should Put Our Phones Down’: Utah Governor Says ‘There Is a Tremendous Amount of Disinformation’ About Charlie Kirk Assassination"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Better headline focus of our amusement-driven entertainment-driven USA society of 2025: Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Charlie Kirk was providing fiction storytelling at the university to a crowd of over 3,000. And now fiction on the Internet about the killing / murder outsells nonfiction. ===:::

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

Did anybody ever listen to that? The shit he said behind the liberals backs to his buddies, like Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation?

Respectful would be tough to spin if they has a list of his biggest radio hits. My favorite was when he would call the opposition Demons.

His debate persona wasn't genuine. Nobody was going to 'change his mind'. He put on a mask so he could proselytize to a wider audience and lure in confused people with bullshit. Just a typical charlatan huckster."

"It really is. Been watching it happen here over the past two days.

Couple of the current lies are:

"He was murdered for his opinions!" Nope, that's absolutely not the reason why, is gross simplification, and a complete distortion of the truth, but it sounds really good for their side and makes him appear to be some kind of noble martyr.

And in response to his on the record quotes of it just being necessary for some people to die to gun violence: "That's not what he meant! He meant it was sad and unfortunate but couldn't be avoided! More people die in cars every year, should we ban all cars???" In addition to car and gun deaths being a nonsensical comparison between apples and potatoes, it's also a complete red herring meant to do nothing more than pull you away from the fact that he was an absolutely vile person that advocated for children to die to gun violence, as long as they weren't his children, of course, in order to stoke the support of right wing gun fetishists.

Just like all of his utterly fake "change my mind" debates, it has been crafted to push a narrative that to a noncritical thinker looks perfectly rational. But it's all fake, it's all a facade, it's all for show."

"Everyone seems to have forgotten quickly that when Trump was shot, they all rushed to say the shooter must have been a radical leftist liberal. Only that didn't turn out to be the case at all. If this Kirk shooter turns out to be MAGA, or comes from a MAGA family, then when do they realize the problem is not Democrats/liberals, it's the tone that has been set for several years now. Let's not forget that Trump has called for violence at his campaign rallies before when someone was protesting against him. He's often antagonistic, and pretty much a dick to any legitimate journalistic questions he doesn't like. This tough guy, mega-prick attitude sets the tone, and trickles down to all of his followers. It does not lead to positive outcomes."

"It’s truly insane that the President of the United States gave a speech stating, and I quote: “violence and murder are the consequences of demonizing those with whom you disagree with day after day, year after year…for years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis…this kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism we’re seeing in our country today…” BEFORE THE SHOOTER HAD EVEN BEEN CAUGHT. They just assumed it was someone on the left. Now to find out Tyler Robinson was not even registered to any political party and his personal beliefs are still unknown. Talk about division and demonization huh?"

"and if he had been to a right-wing military school they would’ve said it was social media or censorship or some other bullshit.

the fact is that you have to look past the words these people use; the words don’t even matter to them. what matters to them is that you are always to blame, nothing will ever be enough, and they won’t stop until they have power over us.

nazis devised the global jewish conspiracy that went the same way. jews were always to blame somehow, some way. it didn’t matter who they were imor what they did. every foul thing was their fault somehow and it wasn’t ever about reality or fact or objectivity; it was about blaming jews and eventually killing then."

"At this point I must say that the r/Conservative subreddit is turning into a serious breeding ground for domestic terrorism. They’ve been defending pedophiles, assassins/murderers, and a variety of criminals. If it were up to me, I’d have AI review all the profiles and put the profiles with red flags on a watch list, I’m seriously concerned someone from that subreddit is going to escalate into another violent event and I hope precautions are being taken.

Just yesterday I saw 20+ comments advocating for civil war, beating up “libs”, shooting their fellow Americans, etc. That is absolutely batshit crazy, and now they’ve pivoted to blaming the 70%+ republican attended university."

George Lucas media ecology lessons for Star Wars Audience, Power of Myth, 1988: "The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in **most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward** on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy. Now, today there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity." ===:::

"We’re seeing a lot of these shooters being terminally online hyper-nihilists. They’re doing these shootings with memes as their “manifestos” because they have no point other than thinking life itself is absurd and pointless.

The only real takeaway here is that we have fucked up raising Gen Z so, so, so badly. We’ve put them in a world where the only point of existing is to suffer and be ignored. This feels like an act of defiance against the hell they’ve been born into."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Yesterday (shooting day) is September 11 terrorism day of year 2011. People do not want to face up that the Quran is a meme system from year 635. Quran is fiction poetry memes. Just like the stuff being discussed in September 11 2025 with these online terrorists. The Mosque is a media venue of memes (John 1:1 - God is memes and only memes, God is language and only language). There is no supernatural, there is addictive poetry. There is no magical Bible book, it is media addiction to science fiction stories.
“The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
