Not trying to be a dick, but It's the most likely response given all his overreach so far. Trump wants a civil war, and he's gonna get a civil war. And every day Americans wait and see is another day he has to prepare for it.

"I think you’re right and yet I’m at a complete loss as to what to do. We’ve had rallies they ignore. We’ve seen protests and seen their escalating response. The most important thing I could do was to vote and I’ve done that.

I have spoken out. Many have spoken out. Good friends, family have ignored it and didn’t care. I’ve lost my father and uncle to this Trump cult and they don’t want to hear it. They call me deranged (TDS). What do you do when speaking up only pushes away the people I’d most like to reach?

I’m so sad that the people I loved held values that they so easily tossed aside. My grandfathers both fought in WW2 against fascism. They put their lives on the line against this, but all of their children fell in line supporting this narcissistic dictator, and they don’t even see it.

I went to a New Year’s party with my uncle last year. One of the gents at the party, my uncle’s good friend was so sad that his wife of 40 years was divorcing him, literally over Trump. They truly don’t care how appalling he is to us and think she’s divorcing him over Trump instead of divorcing the man she loved over his lack of values.

So I ask again, and I’d love to ask this of the children of the Germans who grew up as the Nazis rose to power. How do we effectively stop this?"

"Having talked to servicemen and retired servicemen, the brainwashing and shall we say "reshaping" of people's personalities when they go into the service is troubling, to put it mildly. I get it - you have to make people into effective fighting units that will follow orders without question and be willing to kill or be killed without hesitation. Unfortunately, it takes very little tinkering with that formula to make them all too eager to obey and kill, and very little effort to create new "others" who are the "enemies of freedom" and who need to be killed. Obviously, not all soldiers are like this, and a bit too much exposure to reality snaps some of them out of the supposed glory of violence in the name of one's nation, but in general you can't expect the military to save you from a dictatorship."

"This thread is chock full of ridiculous stereotypes. Everybody acting like they "know" the nerds.

"Mmmactually it was the nerds who were the pricks in high school, not the popular guys"

Was that high school on fucking Mars? The popular people in my high school were vicious assholes. They were getting into fist fights regularly and picking fights with anyone they thought were too weak to fight back.

We had a computer lab where "socially disadvantaged" kids would attend classes but would also practice programming and bounce ideas off each other during free time. Just collaborating and minding their own business. Well the "popular" kids would sometimes come into the lab and physically harass the people using the computers and taunting them. Calling them (said with air quotes by the "cool" kids) "hackers".

"Hey Mike, you going to hack into the FBI mainframe lol" while grabbing their wheeled chairs and flinging them across the room.

Just dumb shit.

Maybe it's because I was in a dying working class hockey town but the "cool" kids fucking sucked and the "nerds" literally weren't hurting anybody. They were probably just trying to get good enough at programming so they could get the hell out of this shitty town.

It seems to be that people are taking the worst examples of silicon valley moguls (who are absolutely off the rails insane) and applying them to people they didn't much care for in high school for what ever reason. The people that have risen to the top of the heap in silicon valley are a rare breed of ruthless sociopaths who just happen to be technically inclined. If you want someone to blame for the situation then blame corporate America. Every industry, whether it's tech or medicine or automotive, rewards the worst of the worst for ruthless short term cost cutting thinking. It's all about making the share holders happy.

The nerds from our high school didn't create this situation. This is late stage capitalism and it's pervasive in every single industry. The tech moguls are the lightning rods for everyone's ire lately because their influence is so all encompassing and they're playing with people's lives by cosying up to fascist elements within the ruling class."

"Many many wealthy people have zero idea what things cost and how an actual budget for living works. This isn't some form of hyperbole, it's real. This is one reason so many support minimum wage either being removed or kept low because they actually believe that you can survive on $7.50 an hour. They likely don't even realize that minimum wage barely exceeds $15k a year and that won't even cover rent in roughly half the homes someone could rent BEFORE TAX and not even including food, transportation, and healthcare (which at that level pay is often non-existent.) That also assumes you'll get 40 hours each week which you WON'T because the business doesn't want you getting to close to overtime hours. These same folks also don't believe in food stamps because all food stamps users are apparently drug addicts and lazy folks who don't want to work. They also think the reason many people are poor, if it isn't laziness, is because they buy frivolous things like cell phones or a streaming subscription. The audacity these folks believe YOU have for asking for higher wages is a reflection of their ineptitude and empathy. The rich don't get that way by caring about anything but what's in their world or what's in their way and anyone asking for money is in their way."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This is my experience. I worked for 2 of the 3 richest people in the entire world 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 as both contractor and employee... out of touch with the wealth gap living. Repeating what the Reddit comment says: "Many many wealthy people have zero idea what things cost and how an actual budget for living works. This isn't some form of hyperbole, it's real" - the real loss of nonfiction with minds so stuffed with fiction addiction. Techniques of marketing, public relations, fiction have eclipsed human comprehension and *reality itself*. "They also think the reason many people are poor, if it isn't laziness" ...

"What scares me is that parents don't even seem to care. I'm a teacher and while some of my job could probably be done by AI, not all of it can. Your child is never going to connect with an AI the way it does with a human. But I've heard parents say that teachers are going to be replaced by AI like it's a good thing."

"One would think so if they weren't in an obvious right wing extremist cult. So the rest of us are suffering because of them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Kremlin created 5,000 cults in late year 2012 and started to deploy the cult patterns in March 2013 onward. ["Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа."](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md) - that's what Reddit / Bluesky social media addicts don't get, socail media addiciton to *content / messages*. It is not a cult of Donald Trump, it is a cult of *messages* about POTUS status symbol and other status symbols being waved around and dramatized. Infomation cult. These run much deeper in the mind. John 1:1 Bible verse depth. Again, also note the tiny length of a Twitter-message that says USA people in cults, but offers no suggestion of rescuing with cult deprogramming on social media. Public library is full of books on cult behaviors and cult deprogramming - but addiction to mocking and insulting has taken hold for entire society. ===:::

"Lol yeah namecalling doesnt work on them. Theyre too dumb to react to such attacks. They literally put "We are all domestic terrorists" on CPAC....

The name calling is for childish morons on the left. Because they think BAZINGAS and Zingers actually do something. Meanwhile they wont bother to show up and vote when the elections and midterms comes because of whatever bs reason they print out."
