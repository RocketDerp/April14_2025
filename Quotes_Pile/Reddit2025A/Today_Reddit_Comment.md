"We Should Put Our Phones Down’: Utah Governor Says ‘There Is a Tremendous Amount of Disinformation’ About Charlie Kirk Assassination"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Better headline focus of our amusement-driven entertainment-driven USA society of 2025: Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Charlie Kirk was providing fiction storytelling at the university to a crowd of over 3,000. And now fiction on the Internet about the killing / murder outsells nonfiction. ===:::

"There is a trememdous amount of disinformation, period. Kinda hard to put the genie back in the bottle for specific instances only."

Get out of here.” It’s like somebody who would start running back and forth while other people try and play a tennis game running back and forth on the tennis court, busting up the game. There is nothing nuttier than playing tennis, but it’s great fun and you believe it’s worth winning"](../Specific/Campbell_Tennis.md) ===:::

"Specifically on Reddit, it's gotten worse since it became a publicly traded company and the API changes. Though I understand it's been deteriorating even before that."

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

"The *news* sounds crazy to me anymore, so I don't mind indulging myself in the occasional conspiracy theory.

Don't forget gun rights advocates pushing back on Trump wanting to restrict second amendment rights for trans people and this guy conveniently having trans carved into his shell casings..."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  So, this Reddit comment is messaging... that if Truth Social *news* sounds crazy, we should all adopt the popularity of crazy and *add more crazy content* to media systems! This behavior is the foundation of Russian information warfare, that once you seed anti-reality (crazy / surreal / absurd) into media environments, people will adopt the nonsense and add more out of compusive behavior. Surkov won, Russia won, since March 2013. ===:::

"Let's also understand, he said the things he said, because he wanted to make money. It's very lucrative to build the rhetoric that allows people to hate. People are not lauding him because they support his defense of the 1st amendment. They are sad because they agreed with what he said."

"They don't care. They don't care when children are murdered or raped. They don't care Charlie is dead. They are using it as a cudgel to attack their opponents, it is the only thing they ever do."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I emphasize the opposite. People do care. The action violence scenes in films and television shows are inicredibly popular. Murder, killing, warfare, terrorism in entertainment is thrilling. In the Russian War Against Nonfiction, Kremlin War Against Reality since year 2013 - the more fition you can make the Kremlin and WHite House - the more action sells. "They don't care. They don't care" is bakwards, attraction to Putin and Trump is all about caring for / seeking out. The Ukraine war deaths are cheered on my MAGA hate addictions / Hyper Reality addictions. This is an audience glued to Donald Trump's hate and dehumanization / harm of poor people.

"I mean that's exactly it. They're all grifters for cash. Doesn't mean they should die, and both sides have their own policy hypocrises, but when I see someone who is, down the line, every single unpopular conservative view and checks every box to a T, especially ones who claim debate and have not once changed any of their opinions afterwards, and uses that to farm highlight reel content, I'm confident he didn't even believe half the stuff he said. He just got a lot of endorsement money for it. And quite frankly, knowing what youre doing is wrong and harmful is doing it anyway is exactly why it's terrible he died but there's a general lack of empathy for it."

"It's such bullshit that they just ignore the shit he said on his radio program.

Did anybody ever listen to that? The shit he said behind the liberals backs to his buddies, like Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation?

Respectful would be tough to spin if they has a list of his biggest radio hits. My favorite was when he would call the opposition Demons.

His debate persona wasn't genuine. Nobody was going to 'change his mind'. He put on a mask so he could proselytize to a wider audience and lure in confused people with bullshit. Just a typical charlatan huckster."

"It's strange how, watching MSNBC, they seem to focus only on criticizing Trump and those directly in his sphere, like they're the "safe" targets. Very little deep dives on any others in the right-wing world."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  In Surkov governing systems, mocking Trump is not resisting Trump. Kremlin / White House techniques are that mocking the total mockery is joining in with the mocking. Trump is playing Tony Clifton acts (as are supporting players). Surkovin screenplays, Surkov students. ===:::
