"Conservatives don't believe in using words accurately.

When they say pedophile or groomer they're not talking about the youth pastor who got a 17 year old pregnant. They're talking about gay people being gay in public. 

There's a lot of focus on trans folks right now, but the conservative movement at large has never accepted any kind of LGBTQ+ lifestyle.

They're way more ok with a 25 year old dude getting a 15 year old girl pregnant because that's regular "normal" sex. As long as they get married, they might not have any problem with it at all. 

That sticker is just calling for the execution of gay people. It's not ironic, the words just mean different things to them."

"The problem is what to do.

Election day is when people decided they were going to stand aside and let this happen.

All three branches of government are compromised and somewhere between 30 and 40% of the population of the country is complicit in this authoritarian takeover.

Until or unless there is violence initiated against Republican politicians by their own deep red constituents at a scale that cannot be written off as some kind of deep state plot, we are all just passengers watching the ship burn from its deck.

They own the country now, the American public willingly sold it to them in exchange for the promise that people different than them would be hurt, despite the protests of tens of millions.

Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of people, trying to make the best of a broken world and raise children in it is preferable to leaving them orphaned or just dying outright.

The only hero we have waiting in the wings is the brutal and glaring incompetence of this administration, and the hope that they fail to compromise the voting system while alienating enough of their base that they get absolutely wiped out in the midterms.

Otherwise, hasta la vista America."

"So again, the problem is religion.

Religion is inherently incompatible with democracy. Religion doesn't teach democracy, the entire belief system is based around a single entity controlling the universe - the ultimate dictator.

It actively discourages independent, critical thought. It teaches that your church and pastors have all the answers to everything and that going against them is morally wrong. It's not democracy if one, infallible pastor can convince a whole town of people to vote a certain way on the threat of eternal damnation. It's theocracy with extra steps.

Religion needs to go. We will never be able to move on as a species until we stop letting people dupe others into believing in magic sky wizards that hate whatever the hot button topic of the week happens to be."
