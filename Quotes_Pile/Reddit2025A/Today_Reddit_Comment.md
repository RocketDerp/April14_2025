When did empathy become so polarizing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : QUESTION: "When did empathy become so polarizing?"
ANSWER: Joseph Campbell lessons for Star Wars audiences filemed by George Lucas in summer of 1986: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. **The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile” — the person is not of the same order." (see also Islamic "infidel", Christian "non-believer" terms to match up "gentile") ===:::

"I believe you’re correct, but I’m also afraid I’m fooling myself. The things he’s already gotten away with are outrageous to the point that I never would have believed it. If you told me in 2016 that this is the state that America would be in now… the end of the rule of law, the huge drop in ethics and morality, the increasingly state controlled media and the lies, my god the lies!! The war on science. If you would have told me all this was possible in America I would have dismissed you as a crazy conspiracy theorist, I’d have bet everything I have that this scenario is not possible. But here we are and I think I have trauma from it. I’ve lost my confidence in what is possible or not and I have no idea how this is all going to turn out. I think many MAGA including Trump are actually okay with a civil war and it’s so thoroughly disturbing. It seems like he might be finally hitting some roadblocks in his agenda with recent court rulings and finally getting some pushback. I hope you’re right! And I hope we get past this and learn and change some laws to prevent this type of power grab in the future."
