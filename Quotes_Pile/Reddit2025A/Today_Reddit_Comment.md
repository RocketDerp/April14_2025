"Ever notice how all these "I swear I'm not a Republican, I always try listening to both sides" celebrities only come out with these "we should support the president regardless of party" and "I'll pray for the president because if he succeeds, then our country succeeds" statements when a Republican is president? Funny coincidence."

"Read his excuse for supporting his cousin in law RFK Jr. Something like - he's a real good guy. We don't talk politics at family gatherings. Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?

Here's the thing Chris. Your Cousin has said vaccines are harmful. When confronted - he claims he said no such thing. Now, he's promoting anti vaxx policies. No need to trust the media or even talking to him."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?" -- which media? media ecology? Which date? Which idea? Where is your webspage showing where the media said fiction. Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Was it fan fiction about your movies? And you think media is the only creator of fiction. Name *one single person* in the entire world, of over 8 billion people, who is perfectly accurate and never ever confuses fiction with nonfiction? **PLEASE... name them, who is accurate and perfect in nonfiction**? Donald Trump can't tell fiction from nonfiction consistely does not comrpehend nonfiction. ===::::

"Considering he literally lived in a van on government assistance and has intimated many times that he prayed his way to success.

That means the "losers" aren't doing enough praying.

Is that about right?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We do not educate people in the most basic maths of popularity and counting. Exactly HOW MANY people can be household names? How many people can be famous stars (Chris Pratt)? How many people can have the lead role in a film? how many people can win the olympics? How many can win the FIFA World Cup? It is a maths issue. Every person who is injured in sports or missed a job interview (wihtout counting maths perspective) thinks that they would get the job, egoism. A lack of seeing the forest for the trees. How MANY bestselling books of the century can there be? How many number 1 songs can be number 1? How many books were written and thrown into the trash that were bestsellers because people were sick of audience / crowd reactions to books, you never KNOW! Just because something is *popular* (pop culture) doesn't mean it is an ideal.
People go through life thinking they should all marry the same spouse beacause they are the most beautiful ranked. So should Jennifer Lawrence have 8 million husbands? Taylor Swift have 8 million husbands? That's sometimes seems like who purchases the tickets! Since the comment mentions Jesus Christ prayer... The Bible, of 2000 yeas ago, has a math lesson: Matthew 25:40 - you can't all be NUMBER ONE, the 1 out of 100. You are supposed to pay attention to the most challenged persons, the "least of these" Matthew 25:40 ===::::

"Honestly, the whole 'You just hate this administration so much you'd say it was bad if they cured cancer' is such a fucking tired argument.

No amount of accomplishments will change the fact that those accomplishments were done with the dumbest motivation while also failing to address the root cause.

If you were firing a gun past my head recklessly and one shot hit a robber sneaking up on me, it doesn't change that you were toying with my life a moment ago."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : That's a good metaphor. That's what the Founding Fathers created the Great Seal of the United States of America artwork to teach! We are supposed to be the "new world order" of reason thinking (the 13th step up the Pyramid ‚ñ≤ of the Great Seal, equal in comprehsnion to Jesus and the 12 appostles in the Last Supper (13 level up ‚ñ≤ to the üëÅ eye) using a Levant storytelling metaphor). We The People are suppsoed to have mastered education and teaching to a point where DEMOCRACY is EVERY PERSON having the grasp and understanding from 1,700 year old Jesus storytelling and Hindu Upanishads and science reason thinking (the whole public linbrary)! We are ALL EQUAL as gods, and don't follow the motions of the planets like tea leaves readings ("old world order" before year 1776). We are supposed to think and have feedback and measuring systems of science to guide our paths, not just randomoly spray bullets and give prayer to halucinated god in thanks.
[CAMPBELL: "Here you have the important transition that took place about 500 B.C. This is the date of the Buddha and of Pythagoras and Confucius and Lao-tzu, if there was a Lao-tzu. This is the awakening of man's reason. No longer is he informed and governed by the animal powers. No longer is he guided by the analogy of the planted earth, no longer by the courses of the planets -- but by reason."](../Joseph_Campbell_Metaphors.md) ===:::

"If you look at his weird public relationship with religion where he won‚Äôt take a stance on his own beliefs but yet, is super def religious, it sheds some light. Not sure we should listen to someone for any subject that cannot define and stand by his own beliefs. He is an actor. He just wants to please the next the person he talks to for his career and not offend anyone. Nothing super wrong with that until one protects fascism and spread anti-science misinformation which actually hurts people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Dear Chris Pratt - as a Christian, Bible follower, turn to verse "1 John 3:17" - you are to JUDGE Donald Trump, it is a judgement statement in verse "1 John 3:17" - that Donald Trump is without love with his material greed. Same judgement of Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch. And the IMPORTED Bible book is transted to Englsh and is not American / North American. Study the Navajo Pollen Path and other systems too. ===:::

"I personnally don‚Äôt care about his faith, he wants to be seen as religious but keep it private? I get it. I don‚Äôt need to know the details.

Here it‚Äôs different because it‚Äôs public policy.

But yea I agree that I‚Äôm not that surprised."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : people who say statements like this are bewildered. Do you think The Bible is nonfiction? Do you think The Bible is the one and only one perfect book in the entire public library? It is a science fiction book. And if people can't comprehend and read a 2,000 YEAR OLD story properly. Regarding Chris Platt and Donald Trump, if he is so poor at literacy he can't find verse "1 John 3:17' in that 2,000 year old story - what luck do you think Chris Pratt has reading year 1776 Founding Fathers writings if he can't comprehend 2,000 year old Bible fiction? This is a LITERACY problem, not a FAITH or "BELIEF" problem. It is not good to let people run around with fundamental misundersanding and comrpehension failures and act like they aren't misinterpreting other books, users manuals, websites, literature, art work! Test Chris Plat on some song lyrics, what wild interpretations does he come up with if he can't see "1 John 3:17" applies to Donald Trump judgement by Bible fiction fans? WISE UP USA - we have hundreds of millions of people who can't tell Russian Internet memes are fiction. We have people who think Fox news is nonfiction! Addiction to fiction is driving the Donald Trump nation. the TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD Bible literacy is EVIDENCE of an absence of media ecology literacy (Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers level of multi-media literacy) ===:::

"Ah, the comment I was hoping to see!

If nobody said it, I was going to say the same thing. Been shopping at Target for about 20-25 years, they always seemed to be the high-end big box store with quality products. We all used to call them Targ√©t for a reason‚Ä¶they were the snooty upper class suburban option.

Lately‚Ä¶and by lately I mean over the last 5 years or so, they‚Äôve just been adding more junk. They‚Äôre still an option for standard commodity stuff like food, toiletries, books, toys that are identical to products you can buy elsewhere (although whether they‚Äôre cheaper is debatable‚Ä¶I usually have my Amazon app ready to price compare) but damn if their other products just don‚Äôt seem cheaper and more poorly made.

If it‚Äôs Target vs Walmart‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not seeing too much of a difference now. Except that Target is offering the same junk and higher prices and that won‚Äôt fly in this day of Trump-manufactured inflation"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : media ecology crisis in USA of *branding* and planting ideas in consumer minds goes beyond Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch systems. Street gang logic "colors" of identity behaviors on the Internet public streets and phyusical public streets. Hate thy enemy nation August 2025. Democracy does not work when people don't have compassion and love for one another. Hate motivations for profit are the Donald Trump social movement.

"This headline is (a lot) misleading. Target has a policy that requires executives to step down at a certain age and this has been in the works for years. In fact, Brian Cornell was granted a few years extension on his contract.

He's leaving, but not because of declining sales, but because his contract ran out. I think Cornell made a bad decision in January to bend the knee. He did what he thought was right for shareholders, which is fine - I guess, but that decision had consequences that I don't think he anticipated or frankly cared too much about since he knew he was leaving later this year."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter post (Seth is Twiter screenshot ?) + Bluesky + Reddit crossover content on front page of Reddit. *Dehumanize thy enemy* society politics. **"not even a man", not even human, dehumanize messages on cloud computing machines**. Russian information warfare since March 2013 has Americans dehumanizing Americans, instead of seeking out nonficiton such as Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" which needs to be repeated over and over and repeated again until every person age 12 to age 120 is self-aware of what electric media systems have done to our society and how Putin defeated the USA hearts and minds in information warfare. I will repeat and repeat. Dehumanization abounds, hate abounds, hate-motivated nation. Donald Trump attracts hate Trump. ===:::

"He represents the worst of humanity"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This simple statement is *not dehumanizing*. It describes the crisis in very few words. Attraction to badness itself. We have a media addiction society that is addicted to Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People have sold out *goodness itself* to feed their streaming meme channels full of hate of how bad Tony Clifton stage performance is, how terrible Donald Trump is, an addiction to terrible. "the worst of humanity" addiction, induced since March 2013 IRA rampup. ===:::

"this is NOT Ai."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Stephen the repeating repeater here, I would like to assert that the Kremlin war against Reality was described way back in Steptember 9, 2014 (the first year of the Ukraine hot war). [Russia and the Menace of Unreality. How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). Peter Pomerantsev titled the second book in his series "This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality is a 2019 book by Peter Pomerantsev about disinformation and propaganda, which covers such campaigns in multiple countries"...
I'm emphasizing year 2014, year 2019, war against reality, war against nonfiction. And that was **BEFORE the late 2022 introduciton of ChatGPT / generative AI**. These have now converged. Billionare Putin was waging war against reality since the IRA spun up in March 2013 - and now with ChatGPT / GrokAI and other systems - all the billionares are funding machine-message anti-reality content! Everyday people are bonbarded by the IRA since March 2013 and machine systems creating fiction and bewildering messages. [Texan Rick Roderick's year 1993 lecture "Self Under Siege" is critical self-awareness on this loss of raelity subject](https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/). It is a 7-hour total series, I recommend multiple viewings weeks apart. I consider the root of all anti-reality media ecology to be James Joyce's work augmented by Marshall McLuhan's teaching about James Joyce and Joseph Campbell's (and his wife Jean's) teaching about James Joyce. Finnegans Wake is the ultimate confrontation of fiction storytelling vs. science reality - The Bible Church 1,900 years hanging over the Dublin Ireland society. James Joyce: "I confess that I do not see what good it does to fulminate against the English tyranny while the Roman tyranny occupies the palace of the soul." -
