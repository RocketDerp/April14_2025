"
1) Reddit has become a lot more like Facebook in the past few years.  There is a lot more tolerance for low quality info in general.     

2) I think highly-viral info like this has a “frequency” or “seasonality”.  After an outbreak, eventually enough people will forget or move platforms, so the user base will become susceptible again."

"It's so sad how the USA has destroyed itself since Biden left office...

I really hope that the EU will keep building it's own defenses, while providing Ukraine the means to defend itself, because, in the end, what other choice do we have?

There is no compromise with a monster like Putin."

"Cults don’t think."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Extreme twitter-length thinking. This very message illustrates media cult behavior of 3 word length thinking to complex issues. Cults follow patterns of conditioned thinking, avoidng *free thinking*, further even if people are borrowing thinking from books and Twitter and Reddit and other media - a cult is often followers of only very specific books and not open to the entire public library. We need to be teaching comparative mythology in the face of what many people describe as widespread cults of Fox News media, etc. Somplistic statements like "they are in a cult" does not in any way rescue people or call for cult deprogramming. Why are mental health professions all across the world not using World Wide Web / social media to describe the proble and people on Reddit linking entire article instead of 3-word chanting (in the anti-MAGA media cults)? ===:::

"Troops being deployed everywhere - ramping up concentration camps. They're staging for a crackdown. I'm guessing we'll be waking up one morning to 10's of thousands of homeless (including the working homeless), and anyone protesting,  being rounded up and sent to the camps. The message will be comply or you'll be sent to the camps as well."

"I can only assume the majority of "Americans" on this website frothing at the mouth for revolution are bots or astroturf farms because you'd have to be a moron to be telling other people to spill blood on your behalf, and insulting them for not doing so, while sitting behind a keyboard.

You want to kick start the new bloodiest conflict in American history, go spark it yourself. Everyone else seems to be relying on and exhausting all other options before taking an action that can never be taken back."
