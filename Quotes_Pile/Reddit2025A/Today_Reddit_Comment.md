"I reckon they will settle into a state where the conservative talking heads will be the face of the administration. They're the ones with the support, and they'll carry water for whatever agenda the Whitehouse pushes.

I seriously think it will only be a slight realignment to reach this state, and the base will go along. If you're American, you should be really worried about this outcome."

"With respect, I think you have it backwards. The wealthy and powerful have been honing their playbooks to inflame their Konfederacy of Kooks: the uber-religious, the anti-vaxers, Christian nationalists, isolationists, racists and gun nuts (I've probably missed a few). All of those groups are essentially single issue, and will vote in lockstep with whatever party addresses their concerns.

What's also obvious is that none of those groups have any concerns that will actually affect the truly wealthy and powerful of this country. Does anyone actually think that the Thiels/Murdochs/Trumps/Kochs/Mercers of this country are going to let one of us poors open carry a gun in their presence, that those families are going to stop vaccinating their kids, or that they give a fuck about paper coffee cups?

The rich people are calling the shots in a way that gets them what they want (tax cuts and breaks for the rich and corporations) and that will only affect the poors(all of us) negatively. The dog is wagging the tail here, not the other way around."

"The Epstein stuff is also a distraction.

Trump is just a puppet. He's not calling the shots or writing the EOs. If he's nearing the end of his usefulness due to health issues anyway, the Epstein shit is the perfect distraction while the people actually calling the shots, who probably have nothing to do with the Epstein stuff, keep pulling the strings to loot and pillage this country while they still can.

At the end of the day, no matter what comes to light with Epstein or what happens to Trump as a result of that or other things, it's not gunna solve the real issues we are facing."

But now that Trump's in office, everyone suddenly believes the "no inflation" lie.
