"To me one of the most chilling parts of 1984, and one that to me explains a lot of the conservative/authoritarian mindset, is when O'Brien explains to Smith that making someone else suffer is the only way to make sure you have power over them: after all, how can you know you are imposing your will on someone else if they just comply? For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them. That is the point of cruelty for its own sake as weaponized by conservatives ans authoritarians."

"Armies of bots were ready to participate in media wars, and the question was only how to think their work through," he said. "Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers."](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america) - same goes for social media users. Get people addicted to fiction. This problem (crisis) is not in any way unique to the Republican party and United States of America - it is a human brain issue globally. Fiction outsells nonfiction. "The media" includes Reddit, memes and tarsh content, Bluesky trash content.

Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ... alas, social meme addicts can't be bothered to stay focused on a printed book on paper and instead revel in the never-ending mockery of Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton. ===:::

"The GOP is a fascist party and they are in every political level. I’m sure putrid Putin is laughing his head off."

"Honestly watching the fascist encounter with Hasan elucidated a lot to me. They literally do NOT care about any sense of rules being fair. They know what they want, they want to fuck over the people they despise, and they have zero problems creating laws that are 100% unfair and hypocritical. The expectation that laws should be fair is just not in their brain."

"Another meaningless controversy to distract from important things, like the dismantling of democracy."

"They are more embarrassing than their worst critics think they are.

At this point there’s only two types of people who still support them: the disgustingly greedy who looks down on them but find them useful to make more money, and the absolute ignorants."

USA population can not resist absurd and surreal always believes it is accidental or don't grasp why toilet humor draws an audience. Implies that other people are ignorant, but can't describe this as Kremlin information warfare. ===::

"His entire career should have been the end of any political aspirations. As difficult as it is, try to ignore everything political he has done and continues to do, including the Obama birther bullshit. Hell, try to ignore anything from this millennium and even the pedophilia. If ANYONE can honestly look at his pre-2000 career, his scandals/crimes, and his overall attitude towards anyone but himself, he’s still an absolutely awful candidate and just an awful person with zero connection to the working man. How the fuck is our president someone who I genuinely couldn’t vote for even when I ignore 95% of his scandals/stupidity?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The ANSWER: Since March 2013 the Internet Research Agency alterted the minds of We The People to be attracted to self-harm, addiction to fiction, and flock to total mockery and insutling of *the others, the out groups*. 5,000 patterns of mind-fuck deployed. Compuslive addiction to hate / mockery / dehumanization of Americans. **Mocking MAGA is not resisting the Russian information warfare**, only teaching about information warfare itself and educating about cults is actually resisting.  ===:::
