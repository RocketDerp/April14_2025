"Ever notice how all these "I swear I'm not a Republican, I always try listening to both sides" celebrities only come out with these "we should support the president regardless of party" and "I'll pray for the president because if he succeeds, then our country succeeds" statements when a Republican is president? Funny coincidence."

"Read his excuse for supporting his cousin in law RFK Jr. Something like - he's a real good guy. We don't talk politics at family gatherings. Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?

Here's the thing Chris. Your Cousin has said vaccines are harmful. When confronted - he claims he said no such thing. Now, he's promoting anti vaxx policies. No need to trust the media or even talking to him."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Media has made up stories about me - so how can I believe what they say about him?" -- which media? media ecology? Which date? Which idea? Where is your webspage showing where the media said fiction. Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Was it fan fiction about your movies? And you think media is the only creator of fiction. Name *one single person* in the entire world, of over 8 billion people, who is perfectly accurate and never ever confuses fiction with nonfiction? **PLEASE... name them, who is accurate and perfect in nonfiction**? Donald Trump can't tell fiction from nonfiction consistely does not comrpehend nonfiction. ===::::

"Considering he literally lived in a van on government assistance and has intimated many times that he prayed his way to success.

That means the "losers" aren't doing enough praying.

Is that about right?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We do not educate people in the most basic maths of popularity and counting. Exactly HOW MANY people can be household names? How many people can be famous stars (Chris Pratt)? How many people can have the lead role in a film? how many people can win the olympics? How many can win the FIFA World Cup? It is a maths issue. Every person who is injured in sports or missed a job interview (wihtout counting maths perspective) thinks that they would get the job, egoism. A lack of seeing the forest for the trees. How MANY bestselling books of the century can there be? How many number 1 songs can be number 1? How many books were written and thrown into the trash that were bestsellers because people were sick of audience / crowd reactions to books, you never KNOW! Just because something is *popular* (pop culture) doesn't mean it is an ideal.
People go through life thinking they should all marry the same spouse beacause they are the most beautiful ranked. So should Jennifer Lawrence have 8 million husbands? Taylor Swift have 8 million husbands? That's sometimes seems like who purchases the tickets! Since the comment mentions Jesus Christ prayer... The Bible, of 2000 yeas ago, has a math lesson: Matthew 25:40 - you can't all be NUMBER ONE, the 1 out of 100. You are supposed to pay attention to the most challenged persons, the "least of these" Matthew 25:40 ===::::

"Honestly, the whole 'You just hate this administration so much you'd say it was bad if they cured cancer' is such a fucking tired argument.

No amount of accomplishments will change the fact that those accomplishments were done with the dumbest motivation while also failing to address the root cause.

If you were firing a gun past my head recklessly and one shot hit a robber sneaking up on me, it doesn't change that you were toying with my life a moment ago."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : That's a good metaphor. That's what the Founding Fathers created the Great Seal of the United States of America artwork to teach! We are supposed to be the "new world order" of reason thinking (the 13th step up the Pyramid ‚ñ≤ of the Great Seal, equal in comprehsnion to Jesus and the 12 appostles in the Last Supper (13 level up ‚ñ≤ to the üëÅ eye) using a Levant storytelling metaphor). We The People are suppsoed to have mastered education and teaching to a point where DEMOCRACY is EVERY PERSON having the grasp and understanding from 1,700 year old Jesus storytelling and Hindu Upanishads and science reason thinking (the whole public linbrary)! We are ALL EQUAL as gods, and don't follow the motions of the planets like tea leaves readings ("old world order" before year 1776). We are supposed to think and have feedback and measuring systems of science to guide our paths, not just randomoly spray bullets and give prayer to halucinated god in thanks.

No longer is he guided by the analogy of the planted earth, no longer by the courses of the planets -- but by reason."](../Joseph_Campbell_Metaphors.md) ===:::

"If you look at his weird public relationship with religion where he won‚Äôt take a stance on his own beliefs but yet, is super def religious, it sheds some light. Not sure we should listen to someone for any subject that cannot define and stand by his own beliefs. He is an actor. He just wants to please the next the person he talks to for his career and not offend anyone. Nothing super wrong with that until one protects fascism and spread anti-science misinformation which actually hurts people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Dear Chris Pratt - as a Christian, Bible follower, turn to verse "1 John 3:17" - you are to JUDGE Donald Trump, it is a judgement statement in verse "1 John 3:17" - that Donald Trump is without love with his material greed. Same judgement of Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch. And the IMPORTED Bible book is transted to Englsh and is not American / North American. Study the Navajo Pollen Path and other systems too. ===:::

But yea I agree that I‚Äôm not that surprised."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : people who say statements like this are bewildered. Do you think The Bible is nonfiction? Do you think The Bible is the one and only one perfect book in the entire public library? It is a science fiction book. And if people can't comprehend and read a 2,000 YEAR OLD story properly. Regarding Chris Platt and Donald Trump, if he is so poor at literacy he can't find verse "1 John 3:17' in that 2,000 year old story - what luck do you think Chris Pratt has reading year 1776 Founding Fathers writings if he can't comprehend 2,000 year old Bible fiction? This is a LITERACY problem, not a FAITH or "BELIEF" problem. It is not good to let people run around with fundamental misundersanding and comrpehension failures and act like they aren't misinterpreting other books, users manuals, websites, literature, art work! Test Chris Plat on some song lyrics, what wild interpretations does he come up with if he can't see "1 John 3:17" applies to Donald Trump judgement by Bible fiction fans? WISE UP USA - we have hundreds of millions of people who can't tell Russian Internet memes are fiction. We have people who think Fox news is nonfiction! Addiction to fiction is driving the Donald Trump nation. the TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD Bible literacy is EVIDENCE of an absence of media ecology literacy (Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers level of multi-media literacy) ===:::

"Ah, the comment I was hoping to see!

If nobody said it, I was going to say the same thing. Been shopping at Target for about 20-25 years, they always seemed to be the high-end big box store with quality products. We all used to call them Targ√©t for a reason‚Ä¶they were the snooty upper class suburban option.

Lately‚Ä¶and by lately I mean over the last 5 years or so, they‚Äôve just been adding more junk. They‚Äôre still an option for standard commodity stuff like food, toiletries, books, toys that are identical to products you can buy elsewhere (although whether they‚Äôre cheaper is debatable‚Ä¶I usually have my Amazon app ready to price compare) but damn if their other products just don‚Äôt seem cheaper and more poorly made.

If it‚Äôs Target vs Walmart‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not seeing too much of a difference now. Except that Target is offering the same junk and higher prices and that won‚Äôt fly in this day of Trump-manufactured inflation"

"This headline is (a lot) misleading. Target has a policy that requires executives to step down at a certain age and this has been in the works for years. In fact, Brian Cornell was granted a few years extension on his contract.

He's leaving, but not because of declining sales, but because his contract ran out. I think Cornell made a bad decision in January to bend the knee. He did what he thought was right for shareholders, which is fine - I guess, but that decision had consequences that I don't think he anticipated or frankly cared too much about since he knew he was leaving later this year."

As The Church was confronted with 1960's psychodelic rock music and 2001: A Space Odyssey film in yhear 1968, the Levant-triology clergy in USA had a choice of marketing The Bible / Torah / Quran as *the best science fiction trillogy story from old times*, but instead the clergy doubled-down and declared The Bible as nonfiction.

We see this, of course, in the conflict concerning creation science. Some educators representing, as they think, the conscience of science act much like those legislators who in 1925 prohibited by law the teaching of evolution in Tennessee. In that case, **anti-evolutionists were fearful that a scientific idea would undermine religious belief. Today, pro-evolutionists are fearful that a religious idea will undermine scientific belief. The former had insufficient confidence in religion; the latter insufficient confidence in science**. The point is that profound but contradictory ideas may exist side by side, if they are constructed from different materials and methods and have different purposes. Each tells us something important about where we stand in the universe, and it is foolish to insist that they must despise each other.‚Äù

"The right functionally never planned to.

They recognized the power it had to reach so many young minds and wanted it for themselves. TikTok is a golden goose. They want the goose alive and for themselves, not dead.

They‚Äôve spent this entire time attempting to force bytedance to sell it to an American company that the federal government could control.

TikTok absolutely represents a problem for humanity in the way its algorithm can and has shaped peoples minds, meaning the best choice is to perform a series of studies to analyze its effects, identify any problematic outcomes it contributes to, issue ultimatums on changing such effects, create a group within the government to monitor the ongoing effect for changes that violate whatever standards are being set, and in the event of the parent company refusing or failing to comply then drafting a piece of legislation that bans said platform.

The right wants to snake it so they can turn it into a propaganda machine for themselves. If trump could, I‚Äôm certain he‚Äôd force them to sell it to his ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù company and rebrand it as ‚ÄúTrumpTok‚Äù or some other asinine thing."

I also agree with Jack - it has all been transparent to me from the start a decade ago. But all of his failings and shortcomings as a business man, family man, politician, and general citizen have been laid out ad nauseam at this point.

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.

"This. Their entire values and belief system has been permanently modified by decades of indoctrination by extremist conservative media telling them daily that Dems are destroying America and that the cult leader must break some rules to defend it. No different from Nazi Germany. And once the propaganda's rot entrenches itself, it's virtually impossible to stamp out. They will go to their graves with their dumb beliefs.

Consider it took full occupation by foreign powers and decades upon decades for Nazism to disappear from Germany. Even after Allied powers' efforts to de-Nazify, years after the war ended, the truths and horrors being revealed, mountains of contradictory evidence, yet the population wasn't easily deprogrammed. They essentially had to just wait for the older generations to die off.

For instance, in 1952, still 68% of Germans polled believed other countries started the war. It wouldn't be until the 1960s, nearly 20 years after the war, before it was less than a majority. Or in another polling example: a full decade after the war (1955) nearly a majority answered 'yes' to the proposition 'were it not for the war, mustache man would've been one of the greatest statesmen of the 20th century.'

Cult indoctrination is notoriously difficult to deprogram. And we're suffering from a [personality cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) characteristic of countless failed democracies throughout history. But the inoculation to cult demagoguery is an educated and questioning populace before they succumb to the cult. If Nazi Germany is any indication, odds are the 15-25% of America that are full blown maga won't suddenly have an epiphany and come back to reality.

We're only a few steps away from invocation of the Insurrection Act and deployment of the military into US cities under martial law. And with an arsenal of 5,000 nuclear weapons, we won't have the luxury of being invaded by anyone. This is on us Americans, and Americans alone to fight this evil. Nobody is coming to save us."
