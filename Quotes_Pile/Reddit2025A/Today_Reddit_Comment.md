"It was because the democrats failed to protect and ultimately save the democracy and the people the democrats serve didn't give a shit and forgot about it. Biden refused to push Garland to make a decision before it was too late and now it's obvious he was worrking with the trump people. All of these court cases that got delayed and such turned out to have been done so because they were soft on or sympathetic towards Trump, thus making it impossible to prosecute him. The problem is that we have institutionalists and it was obvious as far as Biden's win that Trump was going to continue being a power while Biden and the Democrats remained institutionalists. The people of the US preferred to forget, so this became something of no priority which was proven by just a couple days of online outrage when they were pardoned.

If, by any chance, the Dems win 2026 and 2028, which is seemingly impossible, they will not clear the government and the country of the treasonous rot, thus leaving the way open for another in Trump's family to run. The problem also is that what Trump has done to the country will be a generational repair operation. There's no way the people will keep the democrats on long enough to oversee it and with all these terrorists still in the government, it's just going to happen again.

At this point I'm in favor of the US breaking up so russia has less of a cohesive satellite state which is what the US effectively is right now."

Hate itself motivates membership in tribes. “Hitlerism was a mass flight to dogma, to the barbaric dogma that had not been expelled with the Romans, the dogma of the tribe, the dogma that gave every man importance only in so far as the tribe was important and he was a member of the tribe.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45.

He cannot be this dumb or arrogant and those who can do something can't be that hand tied, it feels all so obvious to have zero consequences. And I'm sure the many victims feel the same. I guess when the world's elite could be implicated, they need to act then.

"It's not just a feeling. The military parade in China, and especially the words of Xi, could very well mark the formal start of WW3.

It's basically NATO(Allies) vs The Axis...again. And they are already at war, with Ukraine being used as a proxy.

The issue is that Russia and China fired the first shots more than a decade ago, when they filled Western society with propaganda and misinformation (and we allowed it). They were so effective that they managed to install a puppet regime in the US, throwing all NATO allies into chaos.

There's no easy way out now, and I believe that's the real reason for the parade...they think they won. And honestly, if you look at the chaotic state of Western society, I would say they did. Hopefully, I'm mistaken."

"Not all of us, but the mental toll of having to point out every single obvious lie is too much. I will add some context, my wife and I are considered upper class in the U.S.. We both make more money than my parents ever could. I still have the hardest time convincing my parents that the country is becoming an oligarchy. No matter how each EO negatively affects them, they believe that Democrats are evil. Why? No idea, considering they support universal health care, and pro-choice. What are they voting for? Lies and problems they never had to deal with. Both retired, both concerned about illegal immigration in a part of the country that had 0 illegal immigrants.
