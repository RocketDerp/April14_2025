"Your right, it's going to be written by Russia or China.

We had the world and we threw it away because they tried to follow up a black man with a woman.

This is the end of the American Empire.  Dying not with a whimper but a rage tweet at 2 am."

"He should have been barred from running the minute he invited foreign interference in a US election from a public debate stage (asking Russia to find Hilary's emails circa 2016)."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The problem is **social media amusement-washes / humor-washes all this absurd antics politics**, crowds on meme machines mocking away in predictable fashion to the Surkov techniques / Tony Clifton performance of Trump. July 27, 2016 https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-putin-no-relationship-226282 - people *LOL LOL LOL LMAO WTF WTF! LOL!* day and night at Donald Trump. The situation we are living in is described in 1985 book by NYU professor Neil Postman, "Amusing Ourselves To Death" - people have lost their ability to not chuckle at absurd surreal antics and Russian media techniques exploit this in the society. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death ===:::

"It was because the democrats failed to protect and ultimately save the democracy and the people the democrats serve didn't give a shit and forgot about it. Biden refused to push Garland to make a decision before it was too late and now it's obvious he was worrking with the trump people. All of these court cases that got delayed and such turned out to have been done so because they were soft on or sympathetic towards Trump, thus making it impossible to prosecute him. The problem is that we have institutionalists and it was obvious as far as Biden's win that Trump was going to continue being a power while Biden and the Democrats remained institutionalists. The people of the US preferred to forget, so this became something of no priority which was proven by just a couple days of online outrage when they were pardoned.

If, by any chance, the Dems win 2026 and 2028, which is seemingly impossible, they will not clear the government and the country of the treasonous rot, thus leaving the way open for another in Trump's family to run. The problem also is that what Trump has done to the country will be a generational repair operation. There's no way the people will keep the democrats on long enough to oversee it and with all these terrorists still in the government, it's just going to happen again.

At this point I'm in favor of the US breaking up so russia has less of a cohesive satellite state which is what the US effectively is right now."

"A lot of americans hate america."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Many people, We The People, in USA hate human beings they disagree with. Hate itself motivates membership in tribes. “Hitlerism was a mass flight to dogma, to the barbaric dogma that had not been expelled with the Romans, the dogma of the tribe, the dogma that gave every man importance only in so far as the tribe was important and he was a member of the tribe.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. Donald Trump acting Tony Cliftion provides constant hate magnet, constant mockery programming content. ===:::

"Because people REALLY wanted cheap eggs, that are still not cheap to this day."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Twitter-think repeating retweeting shallow superficial ideas over and over. LOL LOL Eggs, people so stupid, dumb, idiot that I disagree with. A total mockery nation. Donald Trump is the messaging leader of a society that values mocking as religion. That more mockery, mock harder, hate harder, will make for a better future. Toxic religion faith systems. ===:::

"Everyone wants someone else to do the right thing because they don’t want to experience any consequences of that personally.

It’s a dangerous mass cowardice and greed. It’s not just the right either. Look at how many banks and bankers we penalized after the GFC. None."

"Despite the photos showing people rioting, breaking windows, and fighting with the police, I know people who still insist that it was a peaceful demonstration"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : January 6, 2021 was after constant mental manipulation since March 2013 onward... Russian IRA conditioning of the population to be detached from reality, addicted to fiction media system and self-harm values on a macro scale (fiction like Fox News entertainment).

"And Americans will read this post, get angry, and do fuck all but watch it happen"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Addiction to *watching* entertainment of Donald Trump mocking and insulting is exactly the society-wide problem. People so addicted to Twitter-length messaging one-line trash talk ideas and conditioned reactions. Unable to defend agisnt the Putin Media Invasion since March 2013. Glued to their touchscreens feeling the vibes of the entertainment streaming memes centered around Donald Trump antics and mind exploits (Surkovian governing media systems). USA will not facef up to entertainment addiction. [Grim_Blunt/Stop_All_Entertainment](../../Grim_Blunt/Stop_All_Entertainment.md) ===:::
