"If Dems want to gain any control of this narrative, they should be fighting fire with fire. They should be shouting Vance is trying to kill Trump to take his spot from the roof tops. Then when he inevitably kicks the bucket they should continue to claim he had trump killed to sow as much division among MAGA as possible to weaken his grip on power. Vance won’t inherit his cult of personality."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction addicts demanding more ficiton to satiate their constant craving for more and more fiction governing. Surkov won since March 2013. Meme adelled nation. "cult of personality" is a shallow and superficial, people do not understand that Jesus is dead and the Bible continues to work. L Ron Hubbard is dead, the science ficton storytelling addicitons continue. Media cults of Fox News and Surkov monomyth patterns are **media cults**. Media cults are media cults, Reddit cults, HDTV cults, Bluesky cults, cults of mocking and insulting Donald Trump will continue as jokes and meme cults long long long after his death. Addiction to fiction, avoidance of nonfiction science. Memes to our death. "Amusing Ourselves to Death" - Neil Postman, 1985. ===:::

"Within a week or so of Donnie meeting with Putin so he can be told what Vlad expects from him, Russia did a massive missile strike on Kyiv and killed more than a dozen people and wounded hundreds.

Civilians. That is what Russia attacks with their missiles. They do not use their missiles against the Ukrainian troops slaughtering their own soldiers, with a casualty ratio of 4:1 in favor of the Ukrainian defenders.

Why is Russia fighting this way? Because they intend to simply destroy Ukraine on all fronts until it collapses. This is known.

President Dzhokhar Dudayev - "Russians sick with russism" https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=d7xJl3ZrFeI&t=102s

Americans are sick with Trumpism. Different from Russism. Trumpism, is being a craven bootlicker for evil men. The supporters lick Donnie's boots, and Donnie licks Putin's."

"If you watch the video, it is a specific term. It is understood by Russia's neighbors all too well. It is the name for Russian imperial delusions.

"Russism" is the belief that Russia is the center of a genuine historically real empire, that includes the Baltic states, ceretainly all of Eastern Europe, but historically Ukraine has been the chief prize of Russist fantasies. Ukraine, is Russia, according to Russism.

It's this idea of a "Greater Russia" which includes, btw, Alaska. It's a delusion. But that video is from 1995, the Yeltsin years. 30 years ago, people who were soon to be assassinated (Dudayev was assassinated shortly after this video, and Chechnya is now a Russian vassal) told us what we are facing today."

"Well if its ok for the bluwhytes why is it not ok for Russia? If the answer is because blackmail and money that's not good enough. Im not for civilians dying but for standards in foreign and domestic policy, which it seems we do not have here in the states. When Bongino wrote that "this is no way to run an empire" I both wish he would have elaborated and dont really need him to. I feel like we all know that our own people are the biggest traffickers perverts and drug runners and are inexorably linked to those same characters in other nations. That's why Democrats have left their base on this issue and MAGA is catching on. Can Americans unite against these grossly criminal puppeteers? I wonder."
