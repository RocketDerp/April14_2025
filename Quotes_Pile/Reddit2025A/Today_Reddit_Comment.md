"Depressing music has it's place. But for the love of all the Gods of music, please make it more. Make it angry and depressed (NIN), or make it esoteric and depressed (Tea Party), or make it arty and depressed (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds). Just a few examples off the top of my head. But milquetoast and depressive, where does that get fun?"

"This is maybe not the best example. The right decided that she’s also one of their martyrs (since she was a pretty white woman killed by a black guy in a Democrat city) and have been posting about her everywhere. Conservatives just raised over $2.5 million to install murals of Iryna Zarutska all over the US (with $1 million being donated by Elon Musk). They’ve highly politicized her death as well. Of course, it’s all performative because you know that 90% of them don’t give a shit about Ukrainian refugees or justice/mental health reform otherwise and, if Twitter posts are anything to go by, are just clamoring to say slurs because of the race angle."

"I think thats the one of the biggest kickers to me. I called a friend out for posting a sympathy post. She didn't directly reply back to me but instead writes a follow up comment on her own post which addresses my call out by going "i didn't post about the 2 democrats who were shot because I never post about anything like this"

And im just like...exactly! You never post political stuff yet took the time to defend THIS man? This man who would condemn you for having had an abortion as a teenager - which i didn't say but couldn't help thinking to myself.

Its such virtue signaling and an attempt at moral superiority and its really pathetic to watch. Like yall ain't my friends let alone an ally to me or my loved ones."

And yes, somehow all that is Democrats fault because they are evil baby blood drinking Satan worshipers who want everyone except illegal immigrants dead, which is why we must kill them all.

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

Couple of the current lies are:

"He was murdered for his opinions!" Nope, that's absolutely not the reason why, is gross simplification, and a complete distortion of the truth, but it sounds really good for their side and makes him appear to be some kind of noble martyr.

And in response to his on the record quotes of it just being necessary for some people to die to gun violence: "That's not what he meant! He meant it was sad and unfortunate but couldn't be avoided! More people die in cars every year, should we ban all cars???" In addition to car and gun deaths being a nonsensical comparison between apples and potatoes, it's also a complete red herring meant to do nothing more than pull you away from the fact that he was an absolutely vile person that advocated for children to die to gun violence, as long as they weren't his children, of course, in order to stoke the support of right wing gun fetishists.

Just like all of his utterly fake "change my mind" debates, it has been crafted to push a narrative that to a noncritical thinker looks perfectly rational. But it's all fake, it's all a facade, it's all for show."

Let's not forget that Trump has called for violence at his campaign rallies before when someone was protesting against him.

nazis devised the global jewish conspiracy that went the same way. jews were always to blame somehow, some way. it didn’t matter who they were imor what they did. every foul thing was their fault somehow and it wasn’t ever about reality or fact or objectivity; it was about blaming jews and eventually killing then."

Speculating on the shooter, constantly scrolling for updates, etc. This morning when it was announced the shooter had been caught he read every rumour post about the shooter's identity being trans, left, etc out loud. Once the identity and details about the shooter were revealed he was silent and never mentioned it again. They live in their own reality."

And social media keeps eating the IRA Kremlin information warfare an avoiding Malala's book ideas. In the John Stewart interview, Malala said World War Three was coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjGL6YY6oMs - and she described it like the film "Civil War" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(film) that was already happening in Swat Valley Pakistan. And Malala's October 2013 interview was right before the February 2014 Ukraine war, neighbor fighting neighbor now for all those years Russia attacking Ukraine.  I do not see people declaring we need to love one another, love mother earth, Woodstock 1969 was heading in the right direction with messages. I instead see messages saying MAGA is predictable movement with predictable outcomes. Which Malala was saying predictable outcomes - but pointing out that without love and compassion - is life really good? Is Taliban life even good for the Taliban leaders? I don't believe that. It's all an error / mistake in education and comprehension. Exactly the topics Malala is addressing - bad and terrible education. often rooted in horrific interpretations of fiction (metaphor) Quran and Bible literacy. “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

"This is the problem facing America; the far-right views the center and so-called "left" with equal conviction and belief that they're the problem. All while completely ignoring their own very actions, by leaders and talking heads, and by their own fellow MAGA everytime violence occurs. They only accept as facts and truth the things that reaffirm their already held beliefs. They only believe that which paints the "left" in a poor light, and anything that makes MAGA look bad is hand waived away as fake news, witch hunt, deep state lies.

These are not mentally well people, and I sadly do not know how we come back from this before things get much much worse. At the very least it would require an actual leader in power that cares about healing the country, one with tact, grace, intelligence and emotional/general intelligence. Instead we have another mentally unwell man child with clear traits of malignant narcissism who will stop at nothing to get revenge on his perceived enemies (you are NOT to try and hold him to account for his crimes, because they're all made up to hurt him. Otherwise they will accuse you of the same thing and lessen the meaning of justice and his own wrongs). Just like Miller using "insurrectionists" here, or Trump going after people for "mortgage fraud", ya know, the exact same thing he was convicted of. It's saddening and frustrating beyond belief to sit back and watch America burn because an entire political group has been proagandized to about only being to trust the media that lies to them. It's a crazy world we're in and honestly I'm exhausted by just how dumb it all really is, and how easily half of America is leading us all off a cliff, only to whine about "Dems, LGBTQ, "woke" destroying America.

Just like with the trans boogeyman they've all been hammering on social media and in the news after the one of many school shootings recently. No amount of facts, hard proof and data is going to make them change their tone and admit that trans mass shooters are few and far between, but they aren't going to let that keep them from acting like nearly all mass shootings are trans. They'll ignore the fact that men account for over 95% of shootings and over 55% are White Men, but sure let's focus on the less than 1% to blame for this. They started the propaganda immediately with Kirks death, calling for violence against the "left" and going to "war" (Fox News has made everything a war against poor victim conservatives since the '90s, but sure, they're not to blame for the divide in America AT ALL).

It's like a mass mental illness, and that is making everyone unwell dealing with their constant gaslighting, projecting, lying, etc. Something has to give ON THE RIGHT or this country is headed for self-destruction."
