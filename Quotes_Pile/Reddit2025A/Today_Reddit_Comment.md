When did empathy become so polarizing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : QUESTION: "When did empathy become so polarizing?"
ANSWER: Joseph Campbell lessons for Star Wars audiences filmed by George Lucas in summer of 1986: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. **The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile” — the person is not of the same order." (see also Islamic "infidel", Christian "non-believer" terms to match up "gentile") ===:::

If you would have told me all this was possible in America I would have dismissed you as a crazy conspiracy theorist, I’d have bet everything I have that this scenario is not possible. But here we are and I think I have trauma from it. I’ve lost my confidence in what is possible or not and I have no idea how this is all going to turn out. I think many MAGA including Trump are actually okay with a civil war and it’s so thoroughly disturbing. It seems like he might be finally hitting some roadblocks in his agenda with recent court rulings and finally getting some pushback. I hope you’re right!

"The problem is they don't construct this in their head, they get it from random bullshit engagement bait on Facebook. I guarantee there she's literally talking about a Facebook post that literally made that shit up to farm clicks.

I can't tell you the number of times my mom tells me some random made up bullshit like "did you hear about blah blah blah???" and I have to say "where did you hear that?"

"Facebook"

"Mom, do I have to explain this again?"

And in my case she's sort of half way starting to get it, but there are a large number of people that don't have anyone close to them to counteract the made up crap they get force fed to them."

"I watch Parkergetajob on YouTube, and his whole schtick is having folks debate him about why they support Trump. what I've learned watching his channel is that most Trumpers do not understand what a source is - they will frequently make a confident statement, and, when pressed about why they think that's true, they will usually say that they just think it's true. no laws referenced, no executive orders mentioned, just that they're happy Trump is fixing America based off vibes and social media posts.

the most consistent weird thing is that they all "don't agree with everything he does," so they can totally ignore the rape and child trafficking and sexualization of his own daughter and all the other weird or criminal shit, yet, they all believe in their own flavor of Trump who has done imaginary things that they're thrilled about, despite there being no proof about any of it.

like, just yesterday, there was a guy claiming that Trump has ended six wars. when pressed on it, he very confidently mentioned that one of the conflicts Trump ended was the situation in Gaza. this dude - as of yesterday, September 6th, 2025 - said that "it's not even a thing anymore" and that the region has been under a ceasefire since Trump stepped in. when and where did Trump step in? when did he step in? totally unclear. when it was brought up that there was a double-tap explosive attack on a hospital with a bunch of journalists in it just a few days ago, well, actually, nuh-uh.

I have no doubt that most of these people would be institutionalized if we were still doing that shit."

Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

"And the big problem is, they kind of construct their own reality and then they simply believe the delusion more than reality.

In their minds things are going great not because of any quantifiable real reason, but because the reality they made for themself is going great. That’s why they love Trump, because they love the delusional version they have of him where he does things like get rid of their taxes and wade through rivers to save drowning children.

It’s a mass psychosis and I am so confused how it happened so quickly."

"These are the most miserable people on the planet. They can't enjoy anything. They have to fantasize that were enraged by it in order to celebrate. This is genuinely sick.

Her first response was not what I thought it was going to be. Even a little bit. When she said "I cannot wait for all--" my brain finished it with "my friends and family to hear the news" because surely she was happy about this? Absurdly so but that is the emotion I was expecting. Nope.

"...for all you blue people" even here I still thought she was going to show the emotion we call happy, maybe a bit of unbecoming smugness, but happiness all the same. "..TO BE PISSED ABOUT IT!"

She then expressed a pretty detailed fantasy of liberal who are engaged at the realization that Trump helped them, and they have to admit that he did. She imagines us having genuine psychological breakdowns at the idea of giving him credit for doing something good. And then, only then, does her smile return.

"I love my country."

"I think the mass delusion of what I call “digital adjacency” is very real and very dangerous. Partially due to social engineering and partially due to his weird “authentic” voice, Trump successfully leveraged Facebook and Twitter to propel him to the White House in 2015. People really believed he was “speaking to them,” “telling it like is,” “talking like them.”

Somehow, he continues to mainline his presence into a frightening number of American households via Truth Social - often hourly - employing virtually the same schtick from ten years ago. The dopamine hit MAGA voters feel when they receive a push notification from Donald Trump should never be underestimated. Many of them believe he has a personal relationship with them. Think about the percentage of text messages an average MAGA voter receives on a daily, weekly, yearly basis from Donald J. Trump. Compare that to the number they receive, or don’t, from the other people in their lives.

If we make out of this second term with some semblance of our democracy intact, this decade-and-a-half is going to confound historians for the next 200 years."

"Any platform. During his first presidency, instagram and twitter even the official whitehouse pages were filled with insane commentary and obvious bots. People were falling for it then. During Biden, it got worse. Every post, every announcement, every bill, every holiday and completely ordinary happenings were bombarded and filled with insane comments all upvoted by thousands. Insane shit. Mind bending nonsense. Democrats were cloning people, top comments around the time the IVF bill was being put forward. Ukraine funding and giving control of American soldiers drafted over to Zelenskyy remarks on any issue in Congress even when the bills and transcripts were readily available to read in full copies never mentioned any of these things or even the word Ukraine became truth. Completely astroturfed with disinformation. Dont even begin to scrape into pizzagate, Hunter Biden, and COVID conspiracies. These people believe all of it.

"interesting theory. I was in line in the post office a few months back and an old white lady was on the phone with someone who was obviously in distress. she kept saying, "don't worry about it. just pray about it. trump's gonna fix all of this." I wanted to slap the phone out of her hand, like, *lady, trump doesn't give a shit about you or your quotidian problems. unless the person on the phone is distraught because they just got caught embezzling money and fucking kids, trump is not concerned about it, and is most certainly not in the business of making it better*

"And what do you do? It's seriously like a religion. There is no argument against it. A group of people support him because he said so. That's it. You can't convince any of them otherwise because he is right and anyone who doesn't believe him is wrong. End of story. Their lives literally need to crumble, they need to lose everything, they need to see everything they've ever hoped for completely fall apart and then maybe, a strong maybe, some of them will come to the realization but I'm convinced they would all follow him to their dying breaths.

The lack of education is the other MAJOR factor along with everything you said. Listen to how he speaks. He has the vocabulary of a 3rd grader and the solutions to problems of one too. He speaks in a way they can all understand and his solutions to anything are so simple minded that they make sense to anyone who lacks actual problem solving skills and critical thinking. Ask a 3rd grader how to fix something and they'll give you a solution that would never even come close to working and they'll tell you confidently because on a basic level it seems obvious to them. That's as far as these people can think and they shout it from the rooftops as if everyone else is just blind to it.

It's not just that they feel like there's some special connection, everything he says and does is designed to create it. The republicans genuinely said, enough of the population is dumb enough that we can get the dumbest person we can find, put them in office, and do whatever we want. They targeted every supporter because they knew how dumb they were.They've all been insultingly played and they are overjoyed about it. You cannot do a single thing to change it and you're absolutely right it will be baffling to anyone who reads about it in a history book(if those are still allowed by then)"
