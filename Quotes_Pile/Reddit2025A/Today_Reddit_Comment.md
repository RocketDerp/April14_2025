"There's gotta be an element of extreme cognitive dissonance involved. I refuse to believe that close to 50% of voters are ok with child abuse.

In order to beat them, you need to understand them. They just truly, honestly somehow believe it's a conspiracy and lies. They've lied to themselves that thoroughly.

That's why arguing with them about it seems like you're arguing against a brick wall. Because to them you are spouting nonsense. That's what they hear."

"Trump lies about the weather when we can all see the rain with our own eyes, and feel the raindrops falling on our heads.

And then he gets upset that people don't accept his lies and he reacts as if he is the the victim of betrayal."

"I'm not even sure how the Onion is still around. This administration is like satire of itself."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "What this film is going to suggest is that that defeatist response has become a central part of a new system of political control. And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time. Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics." - December 31, 2014 - more than a decade ago. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html ===:::

"Yeah I don't know how anyone can think that Ballmer is some kind of visionary. A lot of mythos around tech billionaires is way overstated in general but many of them at least actually did build something. Ballmer was just an early employee that rose to the top of an already very successful company and his wealth is predicated not only on the working class like many others but on other people's visions as well."

"I think too many believe the system is fine, its just they are getting a raw deal through bad luck, conspiracy against them, whatever. We are prolific at manufacturing excuses.

More than that, though, its that people do not understand the system, don't care to learn, and just accept it is what it is and try to figure out how to fill their lives with copes and distractions enough to deaden the pain of failure and apathy. Ironic we're discussing this in a venue for hyper plugged in NBA fans who need constant discussion to get their fix."

"This is a blinkered view of political analysis. It's not a "purity test" or egotistical to evaluate the political valence of a particular political party in a world historical perspective. With your framework,  it's impossible to say that the dominant political parties have drifted rightwards. 

Saying up vs down is more accurate is absurd. There are plenty of right wing narratives that use this format and they are 100% wrong."

"There isn’t. When the left-right spectrum came into being it was describing constitutional monarchists vs. outright absolutist monarchists. Those terms have literally always been flexible, because they describe political realities, not a specific set of political policies."

"It's too late and they won't. The bourgeoise convincing the rest of us to focus on left vs right was the game plan all along. The right is screaming about gender and race and the left is trying to move on from that but being held down by the same issues over and over again."

"Vladimir Putin is calling on the conservatives of the world to unite—behind him. The Kremlin leader's full-throated defense of Russia's "traditional values" and his derision of the West's "genderless and infertile" liberalism in his annual state-of-the-nation address last week was just the latest example of Putin attempting to place himself at the vanguard of a new "Conservative International."

"I know a lot of VC and tech guys, and even the biggest tech bro you'll ever meet admits Balmer is a clown and owes his entire fortune to the housing selection committee at Harvard. Microsoft under his direction was adrift and his tenure was the era that Apple took over the consumer hardware space after being reduced to the absolute fringes previously. I have never heard anyone talk about Balmer and some sort of visionary."

"People are just now realizing how much of a colossal idiot Steve Ballmer is with the latest Clippers debacle. He was CEO of one of the largest companies ever for over a decade and nearly every public facing decision he made was marked by absolute ignorance and unearned self assurance. He continuously shat the bed and M$ lost market share on so many platforms and still was rewarded."

"You can't hate boomers enough."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-think, Tweet-logic Tweeting-length short message. Constant Reddit / social media messages to promote that *hate harder* will improve the USA sitaution. Donald Trump inpsires nonstop hate as religion. Eeepest sustained faith that *hate will make* the world a better palce, that what the USA needs is more and more hate messages and hate behaviors (Trup as role model of hate leadership). Foundaiton of Russian mind manipulation to believe hate will improve humanity globally. [USA already knows this is a mistake, The 1954 Equation](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md). Hate is self-harm, a self-own of the nation conditioned by Putin since March 2013 with IRA. ===:::

"Once upon a time, we built a system of Enlightenment reasoning and discussion. If you refrained from participating in that, if you insisted on telling bald-faced lies that nobody including yourself actually believed, if you did not respect evidence, if you were openly predatory, you were professionally ostracized, personally shunned, reviled, no benefit of the doubt granted. It was a matter of honor, of basic social conduct. It was justification for reprisal. Either you're somebody we can have a conversation with, or you're a dangerous lunatic who infringed on our society that we must be rid of as soon as possible.

"Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself" said your senior leadership.

Yes sir, said you. And then went to post about how they might not have your best interest in mind on Reddit.

These aren't beliefs, they're thin pretenses. He doesn't believe these stories that he is telling literally. Your boss isn't telling you he doesn't believe in inflation, he's telling you "Fuck you! And don't you dare say another word about your pathetic weakness to me. I'm a winner, I deserve it because of who I am!"

Your response to that can be varying degrees of violent or procedural, but it absolutely needs to become malicious and effective if you are to survive in this world."

"I know plenty of people who have this opinion IRL. They come from every kind of political direction, their one and only combining factor is that they lack any kind of critical thought and instead just take whatever is the current opinion of the people around them and take a position that is 180° to them because they're so much more special than their fellow humans."

"It certainly does. I like having healthy political discussions with my dad as we are quite opposite when it comes to a lot of recent issues.

He mentioned to me he was listening to a podcast (can’t remember which one) and they were talking about how the real reason Russia invaded Ukraine was because of NATO encroachment that went against established treaties.

He explained he is anti-Russia but could understand this justification, at least.

I had to explain to him how that is purposefully misleading half truth that leaves out all the treaties Russia repeatedly broke which led NATO trying to expand its influence.

He’s one of the smartest people I know and he even fell for the propaganda initially, before knowing the full context."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : USA **We The People have been raised their entire life to know that Russia is the enemy**.

"It's good that you can have healthy discourse and debate with your dad, and hopefully not fall out. Since Trump has come on the political scene, I have read so many comments from presumably US located redditors who give anecdotal comments that current US politics has caused long lasting rifts within families and friendships. I'm sure it's been somewhat of a 'thing' for generations, but this last decade seems to have been hugely polarising."
