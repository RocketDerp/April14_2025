"This is just plain false. This is absolutely being covered by major western media networks.

The people who complain about something "not being covered by western media" are usually the ones who don't even watch the news or read online newspapers. Often, they only get their news from Reddit or other social media, so when something isn't on the front page of Reddit or being spammed on Twitter, they think nobody else is covering it."

"you guys are stupid if you think the United States has any control over what Israel does. The relationship does not work like that, Israel doesn't know whatever it wants with American tax payer money. Then uses the United States to clean it up"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Israel and USA population consumes the same science fiction story "Torah" with Adam / Eve / Moses (Bible front section, "Old Testiment" in the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible) and think they have common values and grounds. It is like the audience of fiction Fox News finding themselves in agreement because people watched the same entertainment Fox News story that same week. There is an absence of media ecology self-awareness of how media consumption (John 1:1) influences feelings of having something in common with mindsets. ===:::

"Man this is vile

They are trying to sabotage the hostage deal. By launching an attack on qatari soil (qatar is an intermediator between hamas/israel) they want the qatari to pull out of the negotiations and thus the israeli can say qatar is to blame for the hostages not being released.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/security-chiefs-negotiators-us-said-all-blaming-netanyahu-for-tanking-hostage-talks/

Article: Security chiefs, negotiators, US all said blaming Netanyahu for tanking hostage talks

This has happened before. The hostages could have been home over a year ago. But the Israelis want the genocide to continue.

This also covers up yesterday drone attack in the sumud flotilla. I wouldn't be surprised if the had a third attack in bound to iran or somewhere else.

Edit: its confirmed, they killed the hamas head negotiator."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Of course **people care**, this bullshit of "nobody seems to give a flying fuck anymore" is incredibly shallow and lacking self-awareness. Social media users are flocking to the topic like flies to shit. War and action violence is entertainment to people who avoid serious discussion of the education / comprehension problems in society. Media addicts of Reddit can't wait to get notification of breaking news events to engage on social machines of Reddit. People give a HUGE SHIT to it like sporting events and famous entertainers like Reality TV star "The Apprentice" show coverage. Sports team Torah vs. sports team Quran live coverage! Fiction story vs. fiction story fighting it out! Sports fanatics with sports mentality. ===:::

"No they aren't next. Putin has been prepping a Baltic invasion for many years, has been clear on his aspirations. Even before Finland joined nato, Baltics was always next. Its not really up for discussion, we know what he wants. Baltics have much larger Russian populations than Finland, that's probably the biggest reason. They also fit better in line with his their tactical aspirations, joining st Petersburg up with Kalinigrad. Then there are historic reasons, returning the Soviet block."

"It's kind of the same for my country (Israel). Far-right/Jewish supremacist/fascist people (whichever way you may want to address them) were gleeful when the US election results came out, and became far more open about their views/goals (they were always genocidal morons).

I think it's happening in many other nations, sadly."

"The simple fact is Putin and Russia are just evil and the fact that you don’t see large scale protests in Russia against Russia’s unprovoked invasion is not because Russians are in fear of Putin’s SS, it’s because the average Russian is perfectly fine with exterminating Ukraine and any other country or race Putin puts up on the pedestal as the “enemy of Russia”

The sooner we accept this harsh truth the sooner we can admit the only way this war can end is if the ordinary Russian citizen is made to know terror just as the Germans and Japanese were so they beg their government to stop the war"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit messages saying that people actually enjoy murder and killing and it just be supported by brainwashed Russian people. Putin has been in power for 25 years using Surkov media techniques. Reddit users can't discuss the IRA since March 2013 invading Reddit itself.
"if the ordinary Russian citizen is made to know terror" - oh, so if the ordinary Israel person is made to known terror on the morning of October 7, 2023 - then Palestine will solve the problem! Faith in terrorism being messaged on dehumanizing machines of Reddit. Fatih in murdering humans. "The simple fact" - everything is very very very simple messaging on Reddit. Murder and terrorize the everyday people of Russia! Teach them that war and terrorism is the answer to pass down to their children. ===:::

"By now, most people see his true goal. Why else would Gaza be leveled to the ground? Because terrorists are in one area, does that justify destroying every building, car, hospital, everything, in a place where two million people live? Israel hasn’t just destroyed lives, it has obliterated the very area those two million people call home. And this while having, together with the U.S., some of the most advanced intelligence capabilities in the world, yet they choose to carpet-bomb Gaza as if it were 1942."

The USA and Israel told Qatar they were going to do this and Qatar signed off. They are just going to release a press release condemning it to save face but will do nothing. This was long overdue. Hamas refused to surrender and now Gaza city will be taken by force. Play stupid games win stupid prizes."

"I'm confused by people surprised by this.

Conservatives are *literally* the party of slavers and nazis. They've been against civil rights, women's rights, equal rights, labour rights, gay rights, trans rights, etc. the entirety of their existence. They are literally the group who rose up when monarchies fell and democracy rose to fight FOR the nobles retaining their (unfair and unearned) privileges and power. They are *literally* the party of social/cultural hierarchies.

Y'all are surprised that they support Trump?

Trump isn't an anomaly of conservatism, he's the inevitability of conservatism. He's the whole fucking point."
