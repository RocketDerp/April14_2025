"This is Reddit. We don't do sources here."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Was one of the big changes in Reddit long-form comment culture when the Putin media invasion started in year 2013. People became far more concerned about insulting and mocking other people than educating and teaching - providing links and citations - that the Google search engine could hit upon topics and keywords. Even if the person you were directly replying to in public discourse didn't care about the link, 7 years later on Reddit a search engine hit could bring people to the old conversation. That media ecology self-awareness started to boil off in the out-group hate heat the IRA induced. ===:::

"Me too. Damn that’s sad I had to learn from a meme."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction content consumers get incredibly sad when a very old man, age 89, dies. A person they do not know except through film and television content. The same younger film media / movie media fiction addicts (Robert Redford context) **can not relate how fiction addicts to Charlie Kirk content (podcasts) being killed shockingly in public while speaking at a University has induced media mania in audience members**. There is a complete lack of comprehension of media ecology and how emotion (["heart strings" metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s)) are pulled and manipulated by wealth content holders / copyright holders. And who pulls such heart strings. The film industry cartels / musi industry cartels / video game characer cartels / who manipulate audiences to build massive wealth / social emdia fiction content cartels (Reddit, Facebook, Elon Musk Twitter) do it even mroe personalized since year 2013 using Cambridge Analtyica and Kremlin techniques.

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?”

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Russian Internet Research Agency since March 2013 has altered mindsets so extremely that media practitioners / news publishers have to amplify everything into breaking news / urgent news reports with extreme language to reach the tone-deaf (meaning-deaf) audience who has been mind-fucked beyond all recogniziton by the IRA.

Gatov, who is the former head of Russia's state newswire's media analytics laboratory, told BuzzFeed the documents were part of long-term Kremlin plans to swamp the internet with comments. "Armies of bots were ready to participate in media wars, and the question was only how to think their work through," he said. "Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers." - published June 2, 2014 https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america

"The Russians could disappear into thin air and it would probably still take months for Ukraine to recapture the country.

Millions of landmines, anti-personnel traps, ditches, trenches, nets, tank traps, razor wire, poisoned wells, booby trapped houses and dugouts, caltrops, and many other horrible things stand between Ukraine and any hope of normalcy.

Dealing with those things will last decades after the last Russian gets turned into fertilizer."

"I agree, the headline is certainly a bit extreme.

To be as generous as possible to it, what I would say is that, on a larger scheme, the Russian offensive to take Pokrovsk has largely culminated. The disaster for Russia that was the “breakthrough” from a few weeks ago north of the city has really resulted in a major kneecapping of the already weakening push.

When you add to that Ukraine’s effective striking at logistics and assets that were recently diverted to the Pokrovsk offensive, it really points to the fact Russia is in trouble.

That also ignores the trouble brewing in the Sumy region for Russia as well with Ukraine now making flanking strikes into Russia itself at this point. Normally you’d think such a situation would warrant more assets, but we’re hearing that Russia is sending troops AWAY from Sumy and towards supporting the Pokrovsk offensive.

I think soon enough we may see the first month of more Ukrainian gains than Russian gains in a long time, and it won’t be due to a sudden massive rout. Ukraine is learning how to effectively clear out Russians, and Russia is rapidly losing the ability to maneuver cleanly and safely with the amount of armor lost."

"This has nothing to do with sanctions. Sanctions are showing their effect, but elsewhere.

This is caused by Russians overextending in a thin strip of land surrounded by Ukrainian forces on all sides, betting they won’t have the manpower to counter attack, somehow forgetting this is the most densely manned part of the front."

"Not for pratically free unlike Ukraine. Russia has to pay China now for what they buy, at a premium as dodging sanctions and keeping things discrete tend to make a product more expensive.

Ukraine can run a Lend Lease tab and pay in decades after the conflict ends.

Or more recently they buy from US and the EU pays the bill.

The EU alone can outspend Russia by a large margin. Defense budgets are not even at 2%, NATO has not even entered the fight and Russia has been effectivelly stopped dead in its tracks with 1M casualties already."

"Reddit commenter just making things up as usual go figure."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Since the Putin Media Invaison of Reddit from March 2013 onward, there is a lacking of people who name-drop authors and titles of books or other off-Reddit citaitons in favor of inband message (bullshitting). The intended media environment outcomes is people forget yesterday's stale comments (boring) as they constantly crave new consuming for fresh new low-effort jokes and memes. Sophisticated mental exploits of CA and IRA. Donald Trump has been influenced by all this since March 2013 and you can witness in summer of 2025 how he uses insults and creativity ("making things up") poetically to draw audiences deeper and deeper into compusive Tony Clifton audience reactions. ===:::

"That college really seems cursed. Taught there for 14 years. By the end, so many crazy things had happened, on-campus shooting perpetrated by an instructor on a professor then the instructor shooting himself dead the same day (and no report released on what even really happened), terrible car accident killing an education professor, the murder of a music professor by a stepson. A feckless, vindictive, stupid asshole of a maniac president (Bill Laforge) who built himself a palace of a home from alumni money and took the school into financial disaster after a post-COVID downturn in enrollment. A chair of a division letching on his female students. Hiring an unqualified con man life coach dean. Another dean going off the deep end and confining an instructor physically in his office. The decimation of all its programs with special attention on the humanities, which is what gave DSU its identity.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We can do emergency NATO wide media ecology teachings from James Joyce, Marshall McLuhan, Jean Erdman, Neil Postman for 18 months and turn our year 2013 onward dsaster sitaution around.
... ... ...
“Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man. The Finn cycle of tribal institutions can return in the electric age, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.” - from the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.
... ... ...
“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

Media system vs. Media system / systems. Study of Quran fiction media vs. Torah ficiton media, fiction vs. fiction, alternate-realty vs. alternate-reality reveal people get extremely agressive when their fiction story does not dominate the whole world ("God" above all else, Levant trillogy fiction storytelling).

"The right is very sensitive even though they pretend the left is the sensitive ones" is out-grup hate patterns. Both groups are correct that human minds are extremel sensitive (all people, over 8 billion on earth) to their favorite media format / media venues / media seasoning / media flavoring / media tone / media storytelling regarding fiction addictions. Thinking that all human behavior is "left or right" is a horrible way of interpreting media ecology and human behaviors. Trying to apply how Bible fiction addicts sat in left or right (where there was no other choice of seating) in front of the King's throne is a practice of mental self-limiting taking to the extreme.
