"Not just your country. I'm in fucking Canada and out of 6 immediate neighbours 3 are Maple MAGA and are all women.

I made the mistake of bringing up politics with one the other day...    
*"Oh I love what Trump is doing down there. He's a hero, we need someone like that in Canada"*   
*"Why don't you move down to the States then?"* -me   

F%#$ing irony is that she's on disability and benefitting from a long list of social services which would be the first to be cut under a Trumplike regime.   
I keep saying that MAGA is not a problem unique to America: similar parties and sentiments are rising worldwide. Even darker days are ahead."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The MAGA "movement" is not unique to USA, and people keep ignoring that Putin and Trump are best buddies and working together. The Internet Research Agency worked with Cambridge Analytica as agreed by Trump in November 2012 to alter the minds and behaviors of ALL PEOPLE.
"Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.", "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа.", "Дальше оставалось только загрузить эти данные в информационные потоки и социальные сети."
We have HARD VALIDATED FACTUAL EVIDENCE going back **to year 2014** disclosed to We The People, the public world wide: "It examined thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017. Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a "wedge issue", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University." - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 ===:::

It’s a nice thought."

"There is also the historic example of Hitler, Mussolini or Kadafi. Unfortunate that they dragged a lot of people to the grave before them. Let’s see if America truly is the special country we claim we are and how far we will be dragged before it’s gets stopped in its tracks. I remember, a long time ago, in high school history classes thinking “ how did the German people let that happen?”. It’s becoming a haunting thought now when I can see how easily it’s happening here and how meaningless the word “American” can become with so much un-American activity being condoned by supposedly very self declared American Patriots."

"There was one 10 minute video where he shows his written manifesto. I read it was uploaded "right before the shooting"'. I watched the whole video on Twitter but it didn't specify a time or anything like that.

I'm also not sure how true it is that they'd be posting about this for months. Their social media got taken down before their name was public."

"Turns out, women are not that attracted to prejudice. Who knew?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-think meme-thinking Twitter-length logic. Explain marriage between religions, predudice between atheists / Upanishads / Torah / Bible / Quran groups? Explain why men in poverty are not as attractive as wealthy men? Explain why women vote for Putin? Explain why women vote for Trump? Explain why people who use spare time and free time on social media don't support Malala since year 2012 and year 2013 when she became world famous? And instead, spend their free time constantly discussing their addiction to Trump mocking messages? Completely avoidant of Malala messages, books? Explain how mothers want Donald Trump to be role model for thier children, including dauthers, while avoding Malala as a role model for thier children? Explain sports stars and rock stars who have massive groupies in every city, even when they are public bigots? Detailed dicussion, not Twitter-think. Malala wrote an entire book explaining the situations and experiences:
“The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”

"And yet they call people on the left “snowflakes”. 

I’ve been over there and seen the circlekerking they do, it’s laughable. “The left don’t like reality and facts!” and “Anything they don’t agree with, they lose their shit!” It’s like they’re completely lacking any self-awareness. 

Obviously not all of them are like that, some actually question Trump and the Government’s actions, those people then get accused of being “Brigaders”. 

So any dissenting voices must be secret liberals, just like the Conservative politicians who came out against Trump during the election. All this time, they were secretly Liberal plants. 

Utterly fucking bizarre and bereft of any self-awareness or intelligence."
