"This is Reddit. We don't do sources here."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Was one of the big changes in Reddit long-form comment culture when the Putin media invasion started in year 2013. People became far more concerned about insulting and mocking other people than educating and teaching - providing links and citations - that the Google search engine could hit upon topics and keywords. Even if the person you were directly replying to in public discourse didn't care about the link, 7 years later on Reddit a search engine hit could bring people to the old conversation. That media ecology self-awareness started to boil off in the out-group hate heat the IRA induced. ===:::

"Me too. Damn that’s sad I had to learn from a meme."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction content consumers get incredibly sad when a very old man, age 89, dies. A person they do not know except through film and television content. The same younger film media / movie media fiction addicts (Robert Redford context) **can not relate how fiction addicts to Charlie Kirk content (podcasts) being killed shockingly in public while speaking at a University has induced media mania in audience members**. There is a complete lack of comprehension of media ecology and how emotion (["heart strings" metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s)) are pulled and manipulated by wealth content holders / copyright holders. And who pulls such heart strings. The film industry cartels / musi industry cartels / video game characer cartels / who manipulate audiences to build massive wealth / social emdia fiction content cartels (Reddit, Facebook, Elon Musk Twitter) do it even mroe personalized since year 2013 using Cambridge Analtyica and Kremlin techniques.

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?”

"The Russians could disappear into thin air and it would probably still take months for Ukraine to recapture the country.

Millions of landmines, anti-personnel traps, ditches, trenches, nets, tank traps, razor wire, poisoned wells, booby trapped houses and dugouts, caltrops, and many other horrible things stand between Ukraine and any hope of normalcy.

Dealing with those things will last decades after the last Russian gets turned into fertilizer."

"I agree, the headline is certainly a bit extreme.

To be as generous as possible to it, what I would say is that, on a larger scheme, the Russian offensive to take Pokrovsk has largely culminated. The disaster for Russia that was the “breakthrough” from a few weeks ago north of the city has really resulted in a major kneecapping of the already weakening push.

When you add to that Ukraine’s effective striking at logistics and assets that were recently diverted to the Pokrovsk offensive, it really points to the fact Russia is in trouble.

That also ignores the trouble brewing in the Sumy region for Russia as well with Ukraine now making flanking strikes into Russia itself at this point. Normally you’d think such a situation would warrant more assets, but we’re hearing that Russia is sending troops AWAY from Sumy and towards supporting the Pokrovsk offensive.

I think soon enough we may see the first month of more Ukrainian gains than Russian gains in a long time, and it won’t be due to a sudden massive rout. Ukraine is learning how to effectively clear out Russians, and Russia is rapidly losing the ability to maneuver cleanly and safely with the amount of armor lost."

"Not for pratically free unlike Ukraine. Russia has to pay China now for what they buy, at a premium as dodging sanctions and keeping things discrete tend to make a product more expensive.

Ukraine can run a Lend Lease tab and pay in decades after the conflict ends.

Or more recently they buy from US and the EU pays the bill.

The EU alone can outspend Russia by a large margin. Defense budgets are not even at 2%, NATO has not even entered the fight and Russia has been effectivelly stopped dead in its tracks with 1M casualties already."

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

Why hasn't Reddit made Jen Senko a household name since year 2015? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad Her nonfiction film came out before the 2016 election. A baby boomer stood up to Fox News, and Reddit commmunity can't organize around a role model person "the little guy" who stood up to Fox News. Reddit lacks media ecology self-awareness of how they aren't opposing Fox News because they too are in a cult of messages and don't want to be bored without a Fox News audience to constantly mock and insult. People are addicted to mocker lead by Trump. It is Fox News beleivers mocking Reddit, Reddit mocking Fox News audience. Russia won, the IRA won, Sukov won, USA lost the information war since March 2013. ===:::

"When I first saw that clip, I was certain the subtitles were changed to make it look like he said that. Then I turned the sound on, and I thought for sure that someone had dubbed his voice over to make it look like he said that. Then I thought it must be AI-generated. I mean, I knew Kilmeade was a real piece of shit, but I couldn't even imagine that he'd say something so horrific on camera.

It's amazing how far the United States has fallen in just ten years. I went from living into the "shining city on the hill" to living in a "shithole country" without even changing zip codes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : New reddit account with to feed the flames of cravings and desires. There are so many people on Bluesky and Reddit raging for Epstein sex fantasy info about Donald Trump. Sexual realtionshps fantasy about shooters / guns. Wrecking the entire nation with social media comments and postings, on on on wanting to know about sex life of Donald Trump. Even if they don't vote for Trump, they turn all conversation into the most fantasy-driven fiction-believing QAnon nonsense about magical information about private jets (Epstein) and sex lives. Can not accept or seek out a normal sate intelligent government leadership - have to have sex content nonsense information be the number one concern! Donald Trump Jr. HIMSELF teased them into information addictions. https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-did-donald-trump-235900050.html - and you can't get people to face up that all this behavior is "Amusing Ourseles To Death" as a nation, Neil Postamn's 1985 nonfiction book. ===:::

"There is just no way this text exchange is real. If you made a movie or TV show you would be laughed at for this unrealistic text exchange that perfectly lays out all needed evidence to prosecute. 

Also, one thing that's clear about this kid is he was terminally online. Not a single terminally online person texts like this. Not even close.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Russia has been waging a War Against Reality on Reddit since year 2013. Reddt is a Russian manipulation and gaslight chamber. A website where people cower and hide their real names and reality out of sheer terror of being a human person. Video game addicts, sports addicts, Trump mockery addicts, The_Donald, anti-citation / constantly wanting people to create original comments instead of look things up on Wikipedia and create FAQ - praising low-effort jokes and noise that drown out any good common understanding or comprehension in favor of people writing and writng the same low-effort shit without reading or seeking out refined (Wiikpedia editing and logging of changes) ideas. All comments get abandoned within hours when new posts start with zero commetns and people race to create trash reaction comments all over again. It is a butchering factory for comprehension as what matters if the constant flow of refreshing /new /new /new on every subreddit. This is the community with the free time / spare time and organization skills to face up to the nonfiction writings from { Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev, Neil Postman } - but instead uses all the energy to humor-wash and LOL-wash and amusement-wash everything Donald Trump does as entertainment. Can not resist mocking MAGA and mocking President Tony Clifton style of acting. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Since March 2013, the Russian Internet Research Agency manipulated the everyday people of USA. Alas, people are unable to look past their fixaton on one person: Donald Trump, who they imagine was given suitcases of cash and hookers like in a Hollywood film (fiction learning / entertainment films), and study how non-fiction information warfare actually works. Evidence going back to year 2014: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 that entertainment-focused population of USA avoids. ===:::

"Every damned tv evangelist for the past 60 years has been pulling a similar con as Trump. There's a parallel there and it's one reason trump and the Republican party has been successful in their current grift."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Bible is science fiction, Quran is science fiction, Torah is science fiction. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Donald Trump Truth Social provides fiction that audiences desire. We are now a fiction-driven society like Saudi Arabia with Mecca, like Putin's Russia with Surkov techniques. Fiction storytelling techniques attract media addict American population (We The People). The rise of the Streaming Media age (creation and popularity of Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube, Joe Rogan podcasts, etc) is the rise of fiction addictions. No longer do peoople have to wait for the cinema to open, or only get the move cable TV HBO offers on a schedule, it is a filter-bubble of egoism non-stop choose as you wish. And people choose: Hate Trump, Mocky Trump. The endless insporation of Truth Social values / Twitter values of 24 hour a day hate messages and mockery, fiction content, self-harm manipulation. That's what Trump provides for everyone, a person to insult and mock. A total population of 341 million people who prize and value hate messages and mockery of pople they disagree with, egomania self-harm. We could all unite and learn about Russian informationw warfare that streamed over the Internet since March 2013, but that is nonfiction, that is real reality. Nonfiction is not popular, nonfiction does not sell. Neil Postman's 40 books are ignored.. because nonfiction was left beyond in favor of Truth Social leadership of fiction. Trump himself sells and markets fition Bible books. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Freedom to hate, hate one another, hate thy neighbor is a core value of educated pepole. Freedom to mock and trick and manipulate with Edward Bernays techniques since the 1920's. Freedom to out-smart everyday rural people with Russian informationw warfare paired with Cambridge Analytica payloads. Freedom to use the most educated psychologists and psyciatirsts from Cambridge Analytica in a plot to manipualte rural less-educated MAGA famers and supporters. Freedom to use Rupert Mudoch media empire to predatory manipulate people who have zero education on human mind subconious and addictions to media itself (Bible addiction, Quran addiciton of September 11 2001, Quran addiction of October 7, 2013 - all educated avoided to the general public but taught in marketing and advertising schools to serve Trump / Murdoch / Musk / Putin / etc). The general publi is not educated on how Dr. Arbraham Brill worked with Edward Bernays, the general publid does not grasp the mechanics of wealth televagelism of Fox News, the Mosque, the Church, the Temple.  “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite.

"You're a little mistaken on that. Fox News has shows that they classify as "news" programs and shows they classify as "entertainment" programs. It's the "entertainment" programs that they argued should not be held to journalistic standards. Guess which type of show they put on their prime time lineup to talk about the events of the day."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I do git commits on GitHub of Reddit social media comments, therefore I am... This whole lacking self-awareness of social media influence in this comment. Twiter-think Tweet-length short message shit ideas. When a jouralist interviews a human person with "oral tradition", is that not news? Exactly whart part about writing e-mail differes from postal mail regarding fiction vs. nonfiction? Is a paper postal letter from Albert Eisten with an assertion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard_letter suddently non-ficiton if he were to have used e-mail from Googel? This is a nation that is so overdue for EVERY PERSON age 12 to age 120 to learn about Russian information warfare techniques (and Neil Postamn's media ecology). Russia's tactics go BEYOND just Reddit comments into props and entertainment exploitation.
