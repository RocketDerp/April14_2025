"
1) Reddit has become a lot more like Facebook in the past few years.  There is a lot more tolerance for low quality info in general.     

2) I think highly-viral info like this has a “frequency” or “seasonality”.  After an outbreak, eventually enough people will forget or move platforms, so the user base will become susceptible again."

"Cults don’t think."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Extreme twitter-length thinking. This very message illustrates media cult behavior of 3 word length thinking to complex issues. Cults follow patterns of conditioned thinking, avoidng *free thinking*, further even if people are borrowing thinking from books and Twitter and Reddit and other media - a cult is often followers of only very specific books and not open to the entire public library. We need to be teaching comparative mythology in the face of what many people describe as widespread cults of Fox News media, etc. Somplistic statements like "they are in a cult" does not in any way rescue people or call for cult deprogramming. Why are mental health professions all across the world not using World Wide Web / social media to describe the proble and people on Reddit linking entire article instead of 3-word chanting (in the anti-MAGA media cults)? ===:::

"Have you ever watched Fox "News"?

It is genuinely batshit insane, unfiltered propaganda. Like always sensationalist, often utterly divorced from reality, and highly curated to increase outrage and a faux sense of self-righteousness alongside a very discrete set of marching orders for viewers to follow. It is genuinely hard for me to watch because it is so obviously manipulative, from the loaded framing of rhetorical questions and statements, the headlines/ticker reels they use being outlandishly inflammatory and unfactual, and the blatent lack of any sort of journalistic integrity amidst their elaborate editorialization. Just an entertainment channel masquerading as news that people erroneously consider a reliable source. 

It is on EVERYWHERE in the south and midwest. It is just playing, by default, in most any public space that has a television. It is on in restaurants and bars and diners. In hotel lobbies. They leave it on in their homes, playing on the TV endlessly. Just constant background noise. My aunt left it on and playing in the other room during Thanksgiving dinner. It is ALWAYS on. In the car there is Fox News Radio. A 24 "news" cycle, like a weird mental pacifier that leaves them the opposite of pacified, that they seek out like addictive bubblegum for their brain to passively chew while a fox host feeds them digested bits of filtered information and how best to "interpret" it. 

That is the problem. Genuinely, it's just Fox News. They have cut the legs out from under the 4th Estate. They are just the personal PR platform for a political Party that subverts the integrity of journalism and lies and misrepresents information CONSTANTLY in order to keep people that seek out no other source of information thinking that they are the only choice worth voting for, despite the obvious and repeated damage it does to them."

"So while Trump is obviously ignorant of a great many things, one thing he's pretty tuned into is the perceptions of his base. He has an almost unique insight into what they want to see and hear and like a weathervane is able to align himself in that direction. He also quickly corrects when the wind changes - remember how he got booed for taking credit for the vaccine? He never tried that again.

I'm saying all this to point out: for his base, sounding like a crazy person isn't a dealbreaker. It's actually part of his appeal. When they turn on the TV and hear a loud ignorant man ranting and raving about stuff he doesn't understand, they point at the TV and shout, "He's just like me!"

This is why he was so quick to stage that photo op on his assassination attempt. We can debate whether he was really struck by a bullet or just debris, but it doesn't matter because his base cares more about appearances than reality, and Trump understands that. It's why they voted for a TV star that played a successful businessman, not an actual successful businessman. So looking tough is more important than being tough.

If you're still with me after all this, I promise I'm getting to my point now. The reason Trump is so quick to cover his hand or any sign of infirmity is that he knows his base will follow him across almost any bridge... *except* if he starts looking weak. MAGA cannot abide weakness. As soon as he has a serious issue in public that he can't cover up, the spell will break on a lot of them. Not all of them of course, but a lot of them won't tolerate a weak Trump. They truly believe he's this strong virile male specimen. Hell, I suspect some of them even think he's actually hiding Rambo-era Stallone's body under those ill-fitting suits."

"But at the same time, who's going to hold them responsible? The U.S. certainly won't. Additionally, this regime will last for decades. The GQP has already set up a line of succession even after F47 is gone. It's unlikely any of us within eyeshot will see the end of GQP rule. Small children today might. *Maybe.*

Therefore, nobody committing war crimes today will ever be held responsible. They'll be long dead before that ever happens.

Given the Current Environment, I don't trust the military anymore than I do cops. The overwhelming majority of current military are GQP loyalists. They're not loyal to the Constitution, and they certainly aren't loyal to civilians. They're loyal to the regime, and they'll do anything the regime commands them to."

"Dude. I had a friend I’d known since middle school and saw the downward spiral on Facebook and finally unfriended her in 2020 because her husband commented something about “killing demonrats”, his words. She posted about Epstein all the time. She was still on an old profile I recently got into and…crickets. Not a single mention of it all since this started with Trump.

So I searched for and screenshotted every Epstein/Maxwell post she made and every “save the children” post. I was going to just send it all to her before deleting my profile, but I’m just so done with it all. It wouldn’t change her mind anyway."

"My one leading feeling about modern american christianity is that, they better hope they're wrong. They had better hope that the afterlife is nothing but a void. They ignore everything their christ has commanded them to do and then declared their actions having been in christ's name. They are all idolitors, worshiping money, power, and men.

I'm not a believer, but I was raised in the catholic church and confirmation at our parrish required a lot of study. I can count on one hand how many times in my adult life I've heard a christian talk about their beliefs and been like "yeah, they actually follow scripture".

In the wildy unlikely case that they are onto something, I'm betting my heathen afterlife is gonna look a whole lot better than theirs."

"This is the old song and dance of the internet, every time there is a disagreement between two groups, both try super hard to deny that the worst exponent of their side exists.

I've seen so many people twist themselves into a pretzel trying to pretend there isn't antisemitism in the pro palestine movement.

When it would be much easier and effective to say yeah of course a movement in opposition to israel will inevitably attract antisemitic opportunists, there is nothing that can be done to combat this other than disavowing them, but that shouldn't distract you from the fact that the Israeli government is trying to ethnically cleanse Gaza.

"Because there’s a lot more antisemitism on the Right from far more influential voices atp who uh, tend to support Israel as a shield and because they hate Muslims. That’s why it gets handwaved away. It’s not as prevalent on the pro Palestine side as it is on the side that regularly espouses support for Israel. To say they are remotely the same is giving undeserved credibility to orgs like the ADL who are less concerned with Jewish safety and more concerned with peddling in hasbara, Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian racism. It’s why they never condemn any bigoted antisemitism from Trump, Musk, et al.

Heck, Israel’s own diaspora minister went to a whole conference of far right and antisemitic political parties in Europe about a year ago."

"Movements are scary.

Once you involve everybody, a cause can easily come to be defined by what brought people to the cause, instead of the core idea.

Josh Johnson had a really good bit about this effect in the "Men's Rights" movement, how it had started as fathers united by their struggle to see their children in custody disputes, but because of the name they'd settled on they rapidly attracted angry men who were bitter they weren't getting dates. And then that's what the movement was, because of who it had attracted, and the original core idea was lost in the noise.

When you invite the people on board with your idea, it's so important to be careful how you do it, because your idea *will* be replaced by whatever unifies the crowd it attracts. Which is how "PLEASE let's stop killing people" becomes "YEAH, let's kill DIFFERENT people"."

"It's insane. I was involved in republican politics until about 20 years ago while I was still young. Family influence as well as active political campaigns in town. There were people who operated on principles. Granted, the principles they operated on are not ones I agree with, but still, there was coherence and I think they truly believed they were making good choices.

For context, this was in NJ, which had historically had a republican party that was not concerned with social conservatism and even had a fairly normal view of environmental protection for the beginning of the century. Then the obvious happened. Once could see that things started shifting around the beginning of the Bush admin. I had left any engagement with their politics around that time, but by the arrival of Obama, things were already completely broken by the 40 years of the "Southern Strategy," which in no way was limited to the South.

Now, the US has a party built on the types of divides that have started revolutions in the past, except their divisions are fictitious or, in my mind, illegitimate and inhumane.
