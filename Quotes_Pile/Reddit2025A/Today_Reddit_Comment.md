"No, they are connected to how many people were killed that were working for western organizations. Last time there was an apology was the WCK bombing. Now the journalists that were killed were working for western publications."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users could be organizing sending thousands of inexpensive smartphoens with SD cards to haeve *everyday people* record video of events and have multiple people show what is happening. In an information war - document how people are starving and being bombed. Organize pickup locations for SD cards every 12 hours and a system to publish the videos from Amman Jordan or other neary by Internet stable location. This has been going on since October 2023 and social media society is not organizing to show thousands of indepenent *non-professional* people given a democratic voice in the situation. People are not asserting Malala's excellent ideas about terrorism on social media. Instead, people react to Israel over and over and over, reactionary thinking. Anti-progress thinking. Social media society has all the signs of beig media addicted to the daily news events and not actually haing copassion for EVERYDAY people being given voice like Malala's focus on EVERYDAY people being given voice through education and stable information systems (stable education / learning systems). ===:::

"The consequences are they lost their moral high ground forever now. Every time going forward there's a 'oh the holocaust' people will parallel it to what Israel is doping in Gaza. People are realising this has been going on, to a lesser extent than today, but for the last 70 years.

From what they are doing now Israel will lose a bunch of global support, possibly even USA over time. While they enjoy a powerful position in ME today, without big brother to arm and defend them things could really change over the longer term.

From that even with ethics and humanitarian reasons aside, this has been a horrible decision by Netanyahu, They get a little more land but the people will always be on the other side of the fence and now their global support will shrink."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think media addicts are entertained by horror films, wars footage, video of suffering, photographs of others suffering and being terrorized. Content creation is what many people favor over compassion and love. Addicts to media reacting to every event of war, not calling for Malala's **nonfiction** solutions to end war - but instead react-commenting on Reddit and other media platforms and media systems keeps audiences glued to streaming information devices. ==:::

"And yet another oopsie doopsie. We're so terribly sorry (that we got caught). It certainly won't happen again (for at least a couple of hours)."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And yet another Twitter-length Tweet-thinking Bluesky-length message on scial machines with no solution to the media addictions to fiction problems. Torah is fiction. Quran is fiction. Palestine vs. Israel is fiction vs fiction information system battle. Reddit meme consumers mock awya in total mockery: "yet another oopsie doopsie" - feeding their reaction-commenting media addiction to the most sophisticated media machines ever created by humanity, cloud computing instant meme delivery systems. "yet another oopsie doopsie" thinking. AN ENTIRE SOCIETY: Sarcasm, mockery, total mockery society.

"Americans can’t fight the military but they can go straight to every maga politician’s home, and every home that ever had a maga flag, and just do what is right for the betterment of humanity"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Americans can't fight Russia's Internet Research Agency since March 2013. Anti-intellectual gun-stroking gun worship American values. So conditioned that violence solves problems. Domestic violence being encouraged constantly when we are dealing with media addiction problems. Social media users won't do the one thing that addresses Fox News (Rupert Murdoch) addiction problems; Stand up for Jen Senko's film. Stand up and teach nonfiction educaiton about fiction addiction. Addiction to hate, horror, "The Purge" fiction, etc. Social media addicts keep repeating their cravings for horror content, nightmares, violence action films instead of addresing that MAGA is driven by systemic violence (D.O.G.E. dehumanization, USAid removal dehumanization, hate promotion, anti-empahty, anti-compassion). Addicts to media don't want to teach about media ecology and media addiction and address the Russian information warfare since March 2013. Craving for violence and action images abounds. ===:::

"Whenever I think that things can’t get worse and we the people are about to stand up I call my dad, who still lives in a small town in OK, to get a very disheartening reality check. Okies are seeing some of the most negative impacts from Trump and GOP policies and they are still waving their MAGA flags. There are far too many people whose only political agenda is harming those they have been conditioned to hate by rightwing media."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  "whose only political agenda is harming those they have been conditioned to hate by rightwing media" - yes EVERYONE had been conditioned to hate via the Internet Research Agency since March 2013. Putin's rightwing media. "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа." And people keep remarking that media caused the hate but don't want to pick up books about media itself (Neil Postman's library) and start addressing the problem. Jen Senko's film rots on the shelf and people make Reddit comments over and over without seeing the forest for the trees of NATO loss of an information war to Russia. ===:::

"The culture difference from then to now..... I mean..... what the fuck happened?????????"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : What happened is the Internet Research Agency waged war of memes against the United States of America and NATO since March 2013: "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа." ... "Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года." ===:::

"I am asking myself this exact question every time I read the news. How and why?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : **How:** the Internet Research agency since year 2013. **Why:** 14 months before the Ukraine war went hot in February 2014. "Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года."  Denial abounds, the USA and NATO have had their asses kicked in an information war.

"Also all of the European subs are being bombarded with nationalist propaganda accounts - notice how many of them are <12 months old and are in the form word-word-number"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media addicts commenting about the social media ecology crisis that abounds. Alas, not offering any solution, just Twiter-length descriptions over and over every day without any call to address the meme indotrination camps that (ultra far-right, ultra dehumanizing) Russia has initated since March 2013 as lead-up to the Ukraine hot war of February 2014 onward. There are nonfiction books rotting away in the public library while people spend their free time and spare time reaction-commenting to images on social machines. Anti-educaiton, anti-teaching, anti-Malala values abound. ===:::

"They don’t like him, but they LOVE the damage he’s doing. I know people that fall into the “my life sucks and it’s not my lazy ass’s fault” that are giddy about the destruction of America, bringing down all the people they see as successful and undeserving to wallow in the shit and poverty they live in because they can’t keep a job.

Actual crabs in the bucket having a grand ol’ time making everyone as miserable as themselves"
