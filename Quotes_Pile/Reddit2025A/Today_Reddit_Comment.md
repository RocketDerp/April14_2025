"HIs is the classis dilemma of the liar. Trump lies so much he has no credibility at all. There is no transparency. The American people really have no information on the president's health. So what do the republicans do? They investigate Biden from a year ago. And so it goes."

"I moved to Texas 2 years ago and joined Nextdoor. I immediately notice that every video posted of every level of regular neighborhood happenings is met with comments like “they’re lucky I wasn’t there with my gun” “wish they would have tried that at my house, I’m ready with a gun”. None of the videos/images showed people breaking into a house, btw.

Just a collection of people dying to use their guns because they lived in a very safe, low crime suburb which didn’t fit their Rambo fantasies. That’s how this nonsense happens."

"Everyone is afraid of a hot WW3, and while it's right to avoid that, it's not right to allow Russia to attack the West through influence, propaganda, undersea cable cutting, GPS jamming, etc. without consequence, and purely financial responses aren't deterring them.

Eventually influence campaigns get the job done, seeding a societal cancer that eventually kills the host. We're seeing that today across Europe and in the US.

"The real question is why we're not doing the same they are doing. Where are our attempts to unseat Putin? It's one thing to not want to escalate, but Russia set the rules of the game. Why aren't we playing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People againt Putin are not self-aware that what Surkov information warfare does is make people addicted to entertainment-based politics. Fiction outselling nonfiction also takes on Saudi Arabia Mecca, Russia, Palestine, Israel, etc. Putin is convincing people that "War All Against All" (Surkov calls the 5th World War) is more social media engagement and excitement than compassionand love. This is a LONG standing problem of the Bible fiction storytelling in USA. Sports games, video games, addictions to competition to entertainment - not learning nonfiction self-improvement. Entertainment of war, entertainment of hate insulting mocking of out-groups is the values of Putin. And USA has discarded science and compassion values in favor of entertainment. "Fight fire with fire" means fight entertainment Putin and Trump with more entertainmet. It has wercked the Earth itself with climate change and religion entertainment wars. Trash mockery politics on Reddit outsells nonfiction sincere leaders. Rupert Murdoch's Fox News fiction outsells important science learning and comprehension. ===:::

"Germany investigated the Nordstream pipeline bombing like it was the most important thing ever. When they requested information from polish law enforcement about some people involved, Poland was like "lol, nah". It's a fucking war, why are we investigating the side that does these things to defend themselves and weaken the aggressor? And to what end? Are we going to arrest the Ukrainians that did it? It has no consequence now that it's done and it was a convenient way for Germany to get out of the remaining contracts without being held responsible for rising energy prices resulting from it.

Germany isn't even able to weaken the propaganda of the AfD, let alone working on tools to counter Russian propaganda."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : AfD is selling the message that hate and mocking of outsiders has long-term payoffs. That love and compassion should be abandoned in favor of addiction to hate and mass dehumanization. Which is more popular in video games, war and killing entertainment. Real life, authentic nonfiction learning - what Malala is begging people to do... doesn't sell like AfD and Russia's hate content. Comprehension and understanding are boring to people who want enemy to mock and hate. ===:::

"As much as I agree with you, my country almost put a puppet president in charge because of the propaganda, the money, and all the finely tuned influence Russia put behind him. Our secret services were so behind they only managed to put the pieces together only AFTER the court cancelled the elections because of the tampering they uncovered. They pushed propaganda through tiktok just a few months before elections. The candidate participated in NO debates. Almost a year later, we see the people that voted for him around us. They are people living abroad, sending money home, that have voted for a crazy man that was about to close the boarders to Europe and basically strip us of any NATO protection. As much as you want to blame the common man, this psychological warfare is something hard to detect and combat."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : There is a society-wide crisis, aftermath, of people being shallow and superficial. People who proclaim Donald Trump is a liar and deceiver, but won't dicuss WHY would poeople believe lies and deceptionleadership is good for their children and future. People who proclaim Fox News has harmed their parents and siblings in their family, but won't discuss Jen Senko's year 2015 film. People who think TikTok convinces people to believe lies and falsehoods, but won't discuss Reddit. Tree after tree not willing to learn and study the forest level of multiple NATO nations. That's why I keep pushing for 1985 dead author Neil Postman for people to gain perspective on attraction to fiction problem. A dead author isn't speaking about Fox News which didn not come along until October 7, 1996. A book from eleven years earlier explains the problem before Fox News and Apple iPhone were created. We The People are taking comprehension, understanding, communications all *for granted*, and we have fed meme after meme, sports after sports, fiction video game after fiction video game, entertainment Fox News, over and over into our minds. Neil Postman's 1985 book explains this as best as can be done in a short 1984 page book. The addiction to clickbait and addiction to egoism filter-bubbles has taken over society. Putin and Trump understand how to feast upon an exploited mind-fucked popupaltion that favors fiction and avoids nonfiction. ===:::

"We (western democracies) are fighting back, but Putin has tighter control over the media than we do. In addition the amount of information needed to make change is much higher, because you aren't going to win elections with information campaigns. You'd have to influence the Russian public enough to revolt.

Finally, they are just better at it. I'm not aware of any western disinformation campaign as successful as Brexit or Trump.

We might be smarter to do things like stuxnet in Russia. That we have shown aptitude in."

"I live and teach in a rural area. I promise that most of these folks will never know the truth. They will continue to believe that Obama and Biden and the Clintons are behind all of this. They are sick, angry, and suspicious and when Fox News is on every television telling you that the democrats are to blame it takes zero effort to believe it.

It’s so difficult when I have first graders repeating things they hear their parents say. It was rough during the election. One of my students who receives several services (van transportation, reading support, speech therapy) was really excited that Trump was elected because he was “going to get rid of all the bad people in the country”. And she’s not the exception."

"It’s a cult. They cannot think for themselves."

Education and teaching are not attractive. Mocking and insutling and name-calling incredibly popular. Twitter-length Tweet-thinking. "It’s a cult. They cannot think for themselves." - the issue is not *original creative thinking*, the issue is taht the thinking is self-harm to the USA. The thinking is follow Cambridge Analytica thinking since March 2013. The abandonment of nonfiction in favor of total mockery. "No Siht Sherlock" on Reddit is that kind of conditioned mockery I am witnessing as a cult repetitive chanting. ===:::

"But it’s not just Fox anymore…. There are so many networks, and then you get into the real meat: YouTube and podcasts. There are simply not enough boomers to keep this going. They needed young people, and they used modern platforms to get a message out that resonated with them. It’s terrifying, and it happened in Germany leading up to the 2nd world war.

But when you called them Nazis, for YEARS, voices on the right AND the left called you an alarmist. The left slept through this. They pandered to minorities without offering a plan to make their lives better. They championed issues that impacted less than 3% of the electorate while not telling the lower class as a whole how they will be moving to a new middle class within 10 years. Nothing.

Fox enables all of this, and they are MAGA heroin for sure. But that makes social media MAGA meth, and the red hats have mastered social media in the same way the left figured out the 24 hour news cycle first in the early 90s. And the lefts lack of effective leadership is doing the red hats every favor in the world.

If there was a party trying to let a dictator take over, the Dems are doing a fantastic job fitting that mold. They won’t emulate an opposition party, aren’t providing plans that people can easily understand and sell to others, so what the fuck are they doing? In 2025 I give the democrats the MAGA MVP award.

"That's because, just like Wakanda, the "America" that you saw was a fictional creation based on the media's portrayal of America. People in AMERICA believe that the REAL America is somewhere else out there, somewhere nice and clean and fancy, where everyone's happy and life is fairly easy.

Not in THEIR town of course but somewhere.

It's part of where the anger and entitlement particularly of less educated/traveled people in the USA is coming from, the concept of "relative poverty" is important in psychology....if you have a perfectly nice and nutritious meal, but everyone else around you is having something fancier to eat, suddenly your nice nutritious meal may seem like garbage to you because everyone else is having something nicer.

Which is stupid, okay, but that's how our minds work.

People with an education who have travelled around a bit understand that the USA is not what the media makes it appear to be, and so they're not as bothered by the idea of relative poverty.

But people who do NOT have that experience see their adequate lives in their town as being RELATIVELY garbage because they're comparing their life situation to Wakanda, basically, and they're mad that they will never get a chance to go live there. And they get even MORE mad when anyone tries to make changes that would actually make their lives better, because they already believe that so many other people have lives so much better than theirs, and political figures have taken advantage of that to push the idea that it will get worse if we do anything like, say, health care for all.

They literally don't understand it's not real and that damn near everything they think they know is a lie."

"Wtf is going on right now? Like surely the WH staff know everyone has been speculating for days over this and it's still radio silence. Like if trump was a-ok don't you think he'd have appeared on camera or tweeted or anything? It's starting to seem like even if he hasn't croaked he's medically incapacitated like he's had a stroke or is bedridden in some way. It's so fucking weird. As far as I know every time a president has had serious medical issues in the past it was quickly reported to the media. What's with all the secrecy? At this point the longer they wait the more serious it seems."
