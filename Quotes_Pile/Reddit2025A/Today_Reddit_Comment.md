"Suicide by cult. She’s not the first, nor will she be the last."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Cults of memes, cults of anti-science, cults of fiction stories. Those who die for Quran and Mecca and Mosque, Islamic Terrorists, are suicide by science fiction storytelling cult. That is what Putin and Trump and Cambridge Analytica mastered since March 2013. And we must educate every person age 12 to age 120 in the entire world on media ecology and comparative mythology (science fiction history, monomyth vs. monomyth story patterns in human mind) to defend against the self-destruction. 5,000 patterns of science fiction alternate reality were deployed by Russia: "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа." - https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446 ===:::

"This is a disgrace - she became radical and does NOT deserved this honor. She failed to see Trump administration as the Domestic Enemy they are. Out constitution warned us about “Enemies Foreign and Domestic” we are here! Stock up on 2nd Amendment supplies and soon make a choice wish side you will stand on - as a progressive Democrat myself - I will stand on the right side of history!"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I suggest stocking up on "sober up from enertainment" 1st ammendment supplies and start distributing them *yesterday*. Cult deprogramming instructions and education, teachings about media ecology, teachings about mob mentality and  "MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M - and study Russian information warfare and defend against Putin techniques. ===:::

"It is absolutely sped up for the first part of the video until she is close to going off the road. How can you not tell this is sped up just by looking at her head movement? Her head looks like it is being fast forwarded, because it is. You can also look at the time in the bottom right corner, the seconds are going up much faster all the way until 22:10 where it then goes to normal speed because she’s about to go off road.

This isn’t an argument, it is objectively, 100% sped up. Multiple things make that very obvious."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Meme addicts to hyper reality and entertainment content can not distinguish reality itself. They are avoidiant of nonfiction reality, not attracted to analyzing and learning about relevant society reality of media addiction behaviors (the car driver is a hyperreal media addict too, like the Reddit audience members aboidant of reality). ===:::
