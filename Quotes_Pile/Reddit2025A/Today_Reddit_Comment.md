"It's shocking how quickly the US turned into Russia and it's even more shocking how their own people are cheering for it"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Internet Mesarch Agency and Cambridge Analytica deployed mental manipulation starting in March 2013. Several years before the November 2016 election win by Donald Trump. People do not take seriously the behavior changes in USA population. Terse, flippant, dismissive, avoidant of nonfiction. Donald Trump entertainer is valued above nonfiction sincere leaders. People compulsively spend all their free time and spare time insulting, mocking, name-calling, mimicking Donald Trump. Attracted to the total mockery unlike any other area of life. Donald Trump is bigger than all the top 10 video games, all the top 10 films, all the top ten sports events COMBINED in how much people can not resist mocking and insulting the Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People do not want to face up how Saudi Arabia and Mecca operate, how Putin and Surkov use antics politics in Russia, etc. Motivating a population to murder neighbors in Ukraine is no small feat. Being a killer, blood on your hands, is no minor life experience. Russia has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014 and the people of Russia are so programmed and conditioned that it keeps going on and on. USA people have been more and more attracted to, flocking to, self-harm and dehumanization with Trump. The behaviors are in your face. People will not stop mocking, insulting, name-calling,dehumanizing "the others" in USA. Every day, the same attractions. ====:::

"So coverage here in Denmark, is that DR (danish national media) has uncovered a plot with 3 individuals with close ties to Trump, operating in Greenland trying to create false narratives, that would hurt the Greenlandic relationship with Denmark, with the goal of creating a Greenlandic “independence movement” in support of Trump taking over.

It violates several international laws, and will probably hurt ties between Denmark and the US further, unfortunately."

"The rot is so deep that the premier of Alberta can openly take trips to Mar-a-Lago to get her marching orders. It's no coincidence that she's pushing the idea of Albertan sovereignty with the end goal of becoming the 51st US state."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : since March 2013, the IRA with Cambridge Analytica payloads wasn't just targeting USA, but all over. The human brain to self-harm. Even domestic Russia is self-harming. ===:::

"I am not sure Americans are aware of how much the relations to their allies are suffering.

When you speak to Americans, it seems they are completely unaware about how much the relationship to e.g. Canada and Denmark has changed just in the past 6 months."

"
> I have no idea why so much of the MAGA-sphere thinks you win arguments by being louder.

It's not about winning arguments. They just want to shut down the opposition so they effectively give up. If you look at US politics right now, it seems to work, too. How many times have you rolled your eyes at something the president did or said in the last DAY and just not engaged because you knew exactly how the conversation would go anyway. I won't pretend I haven't been there."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion." "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds. "Those kinds of tactics are meant to stop democratic debate, and they work." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/

"Do you know what the hardest thing is though? How fucking exhausting it is. If you have a shred of integrity you'll want to provide evidence for your arguments or takedowns. Rebuffing a single talking point can take hours of research, then more time to digest it and form a cohesive argument. So much time and effort, doing their research for them, and it's exhausting.

These chucklefucks though? They're not burdened with facts or reason. They just stroll in, confidently shout a load of bullshit that feels good or feels right to them, some shit they read on Twitter, then just dip. And people eat that shit up. It's not a level playing field, and the more insidious amongst them know it."

"All they can talk about are the talking points that FOX and Newsmax give them. They can’t expand on any of it, they can’t talk without disagreeing because they don’t listen and when they don’t have an answer, they talk louder and say things like “are you kidding me?!” They are simple minded, manipulated people."

"I'd say that's fair, but lets not pretend like folks here do anything but regurgitate the same talking points."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Original thinking is far overrated. People flock to trending and jump on board bandwagons constantly. The problem is WHAT they flock to. Instead of flocking to authentic goodness values like Malala's reformations of sexual realtions in Pakistan, people flock to Donald Trump's anti-education anti-comprehension anti-empathy anti-goodness. People flock to fiction storytelling of Fox News and Donald Trump, not to science and talking points. Same with ChatGTP and GrokAI - the fiction "halcunations" they produce is incredibly popular with consumers / audiences. People do not see, authentic sharing of factual reality. "Sleep Joe Biden" is not entertaining for audiences, trash Tony Clifton performances by Donald Trump and others ells far more. Sober Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" can't be faced by people addicted to antics politics and fiction. People flock to entertainment, amusement, often LOL LOL LOL at the suffering of other people. Death-wishing draw an audience. The what people repeat is unoriginal and hate-filled. ===:::

"Last year I had a co-worker say that the democrats have been pushing awful policies since Clinton, so I asked what Clinton-era policy he didnt like, and the guy just immediately changed the subject to sports."
