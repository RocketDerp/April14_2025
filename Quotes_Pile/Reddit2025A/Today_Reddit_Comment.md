"Conservatives don't believe in using words accurately.

When they say pedophile or groomer they're not talking about the youth pastor who got a 17 year old pregnant. They're talking about gay people being gay in public. 

There's a lot of focus on trans folks right now, but the conservative movement at large has never accepted any kind of LGBTQ+ lifestyle.

They're way more ok with a 25 year old dude getting a 15 year old girl pregnant because that's regular "normal" sex. As long as they get married, they might not have any problem with it at all. 

That sticker is just calling for the execution of gay people. It's not ironic, the words just mean different things to them."

Election day is when people decided they were going to stand aside and let this happen.

Until or unless there is violence initiated against Republican politicians by their own deep red constituents at a scale that cannot be written off as some kind of deep state plot, we are all just passengers watching the ship burn from its deck.

They own the country now, the American public willingly sold it to them in exchange for the promise that people different than them would be hurt, despite the protests of tens of millions.

Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of people, trying to make the best of a broken world and raise children in it is preferable to leaving them orphaned or just dying outright.

The only hero we have waiting in the wings is the brutal and glaring incompetence of this administration, and the hope that they fail to compromise the voting system while alienating enough of their base that they get absolutely wiped out in the midterms.

"So again, the problem is religion.

Religion is inherently incompatible with democracy. Religion doesn't teach democracy, the entire belief system is based around a single entity controlling the universe - the ultimate dictator.

It actively discourages independent, critical thought. It teaches that your church and pastors have all the answers to everything and that going against them is morally wrong. It's not democracy if one, infallible pastor can convince a whole town of people to vote a certain way on the threat of eternal damnation. It's theocracy with extra steps.

Religion needs to go. We will never be able to move on as a species until we stop letting people dupe others into believing in magic sky wizards that hate whatever the hot button topic of the week happens to be."

And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, **What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens?** Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools.

"They are genuinely incapable of seeing that reality. They generally do not see reality accurately at all. Not even being sarcastic, their talk radio and propaganda has been pushing a generally incorrect view of the world for decades now just to rile them up and make money off their rage."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People are unable to tell reality from fiction. It is the aftermath... the Internet consumer society is wrecked since March 2013. Think about the titles of these two books... Peter Pomerantsev: "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia" - 2014, "This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality" - 2019. Those two books from year 2014 and 2019 describe the disappearance of faith in reality and attraction to fiction crisis. ===:::

"Magats quite literally do not live in reality. It does not matter what Democrats have actually done, what matters is what Magats *think* Democrats have done. This entire time, they genuinely truly believed Democrats were doing these things, thus have no problem doing it themselves because "well, well, they did it first!" They are all delusional psychopaths."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Russian Internet Research Agency has been waging war against reality since March 2013. USA has lost the war against nonfiction. Putin won, Surkov won. People insult and mock and nickname, *hate harder*, and *hate thy enemy* values abound in USA August 2025.

"The famine has been very clearly and explicitly intentional. The intentional murdering of World Central Kitchen volunteers delivering food aide, twice. The deliberate use of food care packages as bait for murdering starving people coming to collect the food. It’s been clear for many months that this is an intentional and chosen method of genocide, to force them into famine. Frankly, the UN and the world have shown they do not want to prevent the famine or stop it, considering no consequences have come from those clear human rights violations."

"It really is.

One other not I would add to others: for me, a lot of time old movies are a slowburn/boring, so it takes a lot of deliberate sitting my ass down and steeling through the slow parts to actually watch an older serious movie, but 12 angry men had me at the endge of my seat for the entire duration.

If you are thinking "man it sounds like a niche old movie thats gonna be boring," its not, it gets very fun very quickly, so I heavily recommend giving it a shot."

"This kid represents the feelings of everyone who possess common sense and compassion."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops" - Joseph Campbell, age 82, Skywalker Ranch lessons from George Lucas to Star Wars audience / Hollywood fans publisehed 1988. ===:::
