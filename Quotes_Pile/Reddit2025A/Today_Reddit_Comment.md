"I'm not turning my back on one of the few remaining sources I trust because they are making decisions to continue to provide the valid info they can. If we keep canceling everyone when they cross our personal moral line we will have limited sources to pull from."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The "fly in the soup" imperfection, "bad brand", block-happy / deport-happy society. Instead of identifying the bias in human minds / no-go egoism topics, pepole want to block entire swaths of media venues or media platforms. We aren't standing together in common cause, and if people favor fiction we all drown in fiction. ===:::

"Trump got a transplant over labor day weekend"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fixation on one 79 year old man as the source of all problems instead of We The People having a media ecology crisis and loss of information war to Russia since March 2013. The entertainment people have talking about Trump's penis and other body organs, his golf course outings, his clothing and maekup. Constant attraction people show in USA to anything but addressing the mass psychosis problems of society / mass dehumanization group behaviors. ===:::

"You didn't. It's just Redditors being Redditors."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit is far from the only media platform to dehumanize with no-identity reactionary thinking. Elon Musk purchased Twitter to further social media mass dehumanization and role models of Donald Trump as social media behavior leader. ===:::

When did empathy become so polarizing?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : QUESTION: "When did empathy become so polarizing?"
ANSWER: Joseph Campbell lessons for Star Wars audiences filemed by George Lucas in summer of 1986: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. **The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile” — the person is not of the same order." (see also Islamic "infidel", Christian "non-believer" terms to match up "gentile") ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Top popular comment on the topic. Note the extremely tiny length of the message, even for Twitter or Bluesky this is extremely short. No context is provided other than reaction-comment popularity itself. No quotes of education, no authors referenced, just tossing words into a soup of hate and mass dehumanization. Twitter-thinking fueling reactionary anti-intellectual anti-education anti-peace mob mentality mindsets. ===:::

"While he is doing that, this isn't for distraction.

This is just part of project '25. Sending red state national guard into blue states to squash dissenters and such.

This was always the plan."

Past a certain point, even threatening a military invasion on domestic soil becomes more of a legitimate issue than the heads of state being key members of a child trafficking ring operated by the shadowy elite"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts compusively support Donald Trump / Elon Musk / Putin situation since March 2013 by not becoming serious and teaching media ecology / information warfare to rescue Americans from the IRA + CA mind-fucking. Failure to witness how many think Trump is engagement mockery / mocking. Mocking is not resisting Surkov techniques. ===:::
