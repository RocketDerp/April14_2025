"Not to mention how many cruise ships leave from Florida. This is worst case possible epicenter for widespread diseases that will kill people because the more a disease spreads, the greater likelihood of mutation."

"It's a fact. No evidence other than him constantly bowing to Putin is needed. Even if he wasn't one, he willingly acts like one."

"Clueless that Putin is far smarter than he is yet that's the weakness on Trump, thinking he's the most powerful person in the world when thinking it is not enough you have to act like it yet he does not know how to."

"Because they ran on that before and a huge number of Americans just shrugged and suddenly decided that they love Russia. So the dems had to switch up their messaging"

"It’s almost as if there’s a desire to promote white supremacy in the US as widely as possible, relishing the fact that it gets to appear on everyone’s front page over and over and over again. Meanwhile redditors choose to respond to it by trying to one up each other with cutesy cultural memes instead of refusing to accept this filth. Others ask “genuine questions” to have commenters spell out what’s actually going on here in black and white. This is Propaganda 101, people, and you are being played."

"And they're almost always the most fucked up inbred brand of white person too. They are uneducated and uncurious as fuck and I absolutely despise when they try drag us normal white folk into their stupid theories and prejudices just cos we got the same skin colour. It is fun to ask them to elaborate and play dumb though cos some of the smarter ones will backpedal or stumble and the ones who proudly proclaim their racism makes it more satisfying for me to tell them to get the fuck out of my face, they don't belong near me."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : so "satisfying" to have racists around, a low bar, to measure against. So pleasing to the egomania that humanity is full of racists and other people to look down upon. No desire for a better humanity, just to despise people. Hate as faith. Despising humans as faith. Hat is so motivating and satisfying to people. Mass psychosis abounds. "MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M ===:::
