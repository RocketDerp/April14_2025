"With Republicans, every accusation is an admission of guilt that they have done or desire to do the thing they are raging about.

The same shameless people who complained about cancel culture are now using the government to extort media networks to censor opinions they don't like."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Many People can't read any Levant religion text and locate goodness. And people behaved shocked that other information about goodness is completely backwards. The Bible is 2,000 years old and meme societies think it is not worth the effort to teach and educate the inverted meaning problems https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/ of Fox News, Newsmax, Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter, MAGA, Bible / Church.... Trump fanatics / Trump content addicts are not shameless people, they are deeply ashamed of hating homosexuals and transgender people in their society. But Reddit like Twitter-think short messages that say they are shameless and can't recognize that they are ashamed of black skin color, ashamed of humanity and adore to worship wealth status symbols / NYC tall buildings and other objects. ===:::

"Diaper don the man baby has spoken."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Every day the media addicts flock to the meme networks to say these fetish lines about Donald Trump. They are thrilled to proclaim how entertaining and thrilling it is to have a meme President playing Tony Clifton antics politics. Thrilled that these Russian Surkov techniques provide constant absurd surreal poop-diaper content discussion. Completely avoiding nonfiction learning of how to build a healthy society, instead wallowing in the mockery that Donald Trump creates of the USA. This has been gong on for OVER TEN YEARS AND THREE MONTHS since Trump became the central fixation of media networks / media systems. This is a meme addled society, sickened by junk media consumption, wrecking the world with Donald Trump role model of thinking and insulting people. Shit-worshipng society, year after year, admiring the media environment created by Trump and Putin. ===:::

"The amount of people that have been in support of what's going on with Colbert and Kimmel on FB is baffling to me. I try to tell them its not the cancelations that are concerning its the implications behind them and what they could mean going forward and I'm apparently in the minority with this thought process."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Entertainment addicts can be very picky in their meme flavor and styles. Donald Trump has made everything in society about ratings and popularity, and fiction avoiding nonfiction. Implications are welcomed and embraced, being able to remove music / art / spoken languages / content that is undesired, like block button on Bluesky is cheered on, like deporting undesired Spanish language speakers, filter bubble celebration. Musk and Trump egomania as role model. Facebook ability to use computer machines to dehumanize real people is embraced in USA society. ===:::

"America bitched out in a big way here. No one had the balls to stand up to Trump and now I fear it's too late.

The home of the brave let a senile old criminal rapist take over and trash the constitution in less than a year with almost no pushback.

It's gotta be one of the fastest and easiest hostile takeovers of a democracy in history."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Putin spent his entire life in KGB, starting study in Germany before fall of Berlin Wall, learning manipulation. By the time the March 2013 media invasion of Reddit and other social media sites was activated, over a dozen years of success with domestic Russian warfare against comprehension, warfare against nonfiction. It was not as fast as people think, and Cambridge Analytica techniques were just not posable before the Apple iPhone addictions were / new media ecology of intimate touch screens / were fully deployed on rural less-educated USA areas. Mobile networks had to be expanded, users had to learn to use touch screens and cameras, etc. It has not bee "less than a year" as this Reddit comment says, it took since the November 7, 2013 agreement with Russia to mind-fuck the entire population into complete avoidance and citation of nonfiction on media ecology and Russian information warfare methods. ===:::

"He just brought it back on The Late Show. It wasn't funny at all. The Colbert Report was designed to mock a Bush-era neoconservatism that has now been exterminated. In an era of MAGA fascism, it just feels limp and inadequate.

Honestly all of broadcast late night's attempts to lampoon Trump for the past decade feel limp. Aside from Stewart, nothing short of South Park fits the bill. Which is what makes this whole sordid censorship saga even more pathetic."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Always faith in mocking. The Middle East clergy mocks every other religion they don't like, what has that gotten the world? Always belief that if we keep mocking away and amusing away at our misunderstandings. Why not all hide real names and identity on Reddit and Bluesky, unless you are a Bluesky book author or comic creator selling - then you use your real name. Always more bullshit mocking, insincerity. People say it doesn't work against Trump, can not cite nonfiction of Surkov techniques in Russia for 25 years... Did mocking the GOP eliminate the GOP/ Mocking Busy save the USA from the IRA? It's a horrible deepest faith. Hate and mocking. Everything Neil Postman describes in "Amusing Ourselves To Death" 1985 book. It is the teams of writers doing organized bullying on a schedule with multiple shows of organized mad bullying. And you get bully murder/suicide acts like MAGA as the outcome. We created this with mocking bullying as money making content. We are completely unable to defend against Putin because we mastered humor-washing mockery-washing bullying-washing. South Park lampooned Charlie Kirk and he got murdered, that isn't sending the message of *win* against Putin and Cambridge Analytica that Reddit is convinced it is. People fundamentally can't grasp that millions of low-effort streaming comment messages are filter-bubble experiences. We drown in comments with zero sense of importance. We saw this play out where Russia mind-fucked the COVID-19 pandemic since year 2014, YES, way back in 2014 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - and people can't even cite Bill Gates giving a Ted Talk about COVID-19 in 2015, yes 2015. We CAN NOT get people with spare time and free time (Reddit comment creators) to fight intelligently with information systems. Mocking is the root amusement cause. ===:::

"Even Tik Tok won’t do anything about it anymore. They use to be sticklers for rules. Now it’s pretty much anything goes on that crappy app since Trump continues to save them from being shut down"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Notable observation: On Tik Tok people often use their real face and/or voice, sometimes showing real outdoor locations. On Reddit, content creators of comments hide their identity. ===:::

"During an investigation at work unrelated, we recently read text messages between a bunch of right-wing inspectors. They talked about finding places they believe liberals are concentrated like libraries, marches, nightclubs, hiking clubs, parks. These are wild times."

"Media literacy is dead. These people will clap and bark like seals for things that run antithetical to what they believe because they’re just stupid."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : A twitter-length tweet-think out-group hate comment (out-group stupid) that can't cite or name any authors / name-drop any books or authors or any media education. Not even the simplest "Marshall McLuhan wrote about this in the 1960's" to asset a professor from University of Toronto, just call people stupid for amusement contents on Reddit. Bark like seals at individual trees and not see the forest inclusive of Reddit. Can't identify any timelines of when things change, the Internet Research Agency active measures on Reddit since year 2013. Just mocking group B from group A. Avoidant of *we*, *our* situation and outcomes, and identify Trump as an entertainer mocking-based out-group base leader. ===:::

"They were duped, they are rubes. They have been lead to believe they are oppressed, they have been given a bunch of enemies, first immigrants and now people who think differently. People with "other ideas." This is how authoritarianism takes control."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Name authors, name books, name organizations... *who* gave the list of enemies. It's just comments of mocking the out-group. Russia IRA conditioned all this since year 2013. Message avoids: Not *we* were duped. We are living under mass dupe, Surkov Won, Russia won. An author on authoritarianism teachings? Call to use education and stand up for goodness (stand up for Malala's education efforts)? ===:::

"You know im starting to understand why people say the sexual abuse subtext of Chainsaw Man isn't taken seriously, cause this is real life and some of the people in this comment section should have been removed from the genepool a long time ago."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The video game / film entertainment fantasy of "should have been removed from the genepool". Hate harder messages. Dehumanize harder messages. Anti-education, anti-teaching, short simple "removed from" without specifics. Jail? Prison? Killing? As Reddit is a teaching ground / educating minds every hour of every day to prize low-value no-identity no-citation reactionary thinking of out-group mocking and bullying. People don't learn from rectangle classrooms, they are learning from Reddit. ===:::

"Reddit is where you go to find the worst relationship advice"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit is an addiction. People compulsively flock to low-effort commenting drowning out / washing out medium-term long-term thinking with a massive ocean of anti-citation anti-refinement of information. Comment after comment like rain turning mountains of understanding into sand. ===:::

"For the same reason it's okay, to show a person in a movie getting shot 20 times, bleeding out all over the ground and then getting stabbed in order to make sure they're dead. But show a 1 sec view of a penis and you're "HURTING THE CHILDREN AND RUINING OUR CULTURE!!"

Abrahamic Religions demonize sex or even the thought of sex, while fully embracing violence in all form and western world is run by people who support those religious shitheads because they control the dumb majority of the populace in order to keep the powerful in power."
