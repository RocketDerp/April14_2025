"
1) Reddit has become a lot more like Facebook in the past few years.  There is a lot more tolerance for low quality info in general.     

2) I think highly-viral info like this has a “frequency” or “seasonality”.  After an outbreak, eventually enough people will forget or move platforms, so the user base will become susceptible again."

"It's so sad how the USA has destroyed itself since Biden left office...

I really hope that the EU will keep building it's own defenses, while providing Ukraine the means to defend itself, because, in the end, what other choice do we have?

There is no compromise with a monster like Putin."

"Cults don’t think."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Extreme twitter-length thinking. This very message illustrates media cult behavior of 3 word length thinking to complex issues. Cults follow patterns of conditioned thinking, avoidng *free thinking*, further even if people are borrowing thinking from books and Twitter and Reddit and other media - a cult is often followers of only very specific books and not open to the entire public library. We need to be teaching comparative mythology in the face of what many people describe as widespread cults of Fox News media, etc. Somplistic statements like "they are in a cult" does not in any way rescue people or call for cult deprogramming. Why are mental health professions all across the world not using World Wide Web / social media to describe the proble and people on Reddit linking entire article instead of 3-word chanting (in the anti-MAGA media cults)? ===:::

"Troops being deployed everywhere - ramping up concentration camps. They're staging for a crackdown. I'm guessing we'll be waking up one morning to 10's of thousands of homeless (including the working homeless), and anyone protesting,  being rounded up and sent to the camps. The message will be comply or you'll be sent to the camps as well."

"I can only assume the majority of "Americans" on this website frothing at the mouth for revolution are bots or astroturf farms because you'd have to be a moron to be telling other people to spill blood on your behalf, and insulting them for not doing so, while sitting behind a keyboard.

You want to kick start the new bloodiest conflict in American history, go spark it yourself. Everyone else seems to be relying on and exhausting all other options before taking an action that can never be taken back."

"Im real. I say rip off the bandaid. Luigi was the pot beginning to boil over the edge . It will accelerate into the middle east if we dont all pick a time an place to start marching"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Luigi is a gun-worship symbol of December 4, 2024. Gun stroking gun worship USA symbolism. Anti-intelelctual, sneak, liar, manipualtor from a real estate golf course family values. TRUE ripping off the bandaid would be social media addicts facing up to Trump being an addict to Truth Social memes and Fox News HDTV. Media addiction confrontation of a whole nation. ===:::

"Blue collar stiffs, worshipping a billionaire whose sole policy is to enrich the 1% and screw over the working class. And they elected him twice.

Maga doesn’t even have basic pattern recognition skills, let alone critical thinking skills."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA party within the USA, the MAGA social movement of year 2013 onward is the product of the Russian Internet Research Agency / Donald Trump / Cambridge Analytica all working together since November 7, 2012 agreement by Trump with Kremlin.

"It’s right wing media. That 1st person’s viewpoint is what they’ve been fed by that brainwashing machine. They’re convinced of conspiracies about the “great replacement” coming from the outside by the “southern invasion” and from the inside by BLM, DEI and “woke”."

"When I was 8 my mom met this guy who took over everything after we moved in with him. He would have on every tv in the house and every radio and it would be Fox News or some political show where they all yelled at each other and the radio was always right wing bullshit. 1) it was boring and obnoxious, 2) it was annoying, and 3) their arguments never made sense! “This Old House” was a reprieve since I wasn’t allowed to watch cartoons very often."

"Because they don't consider their interests to be what you consider their interests. They're not looking for better healthcare or good educations or futures. They live in places that have long since given up any hope. None of them have any dreams that the future will be brighter or that any policy will materially improve their lives.

All they want is to hurt the people they view as "the problem." They don't care that they're stuck in hell, as long as "the other" gets stuck in a worse hell."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Skywalker Ranch California lessons for Star Wars Audiences published in 1988 book Power of Myth: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. The myths of **participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile”—the person is not of the same order." - see also "infidel" word. ===:::

"Reduce it down even further than that.

They worship a diaper-wearing, industrial-spanx armored, shoe lift needing, face painted 80 year old spoiled brat bitch baby of two of the nastiest cousin kissing degenerate gamblers who injected the plight of their lessers directly into their veins.

Being a billionaire is nothing. They're not special anymore. Which means they like everything else. The moment they open their mouths to try to justify liking an orange, greasy, 80 year old spoiled brat white child, they're lying. They like having a dirty idiot grandpa tell them what to do. It's their kink."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Texan Rick Roderick: ["It seems to me that young Douglas is going to go to his mum and dad, and they’ll talk to him about it and explain how it fits and so on, and then will come that shattering night when you are about sixteen, and you find out mum and dad are afraid to die too… or maybe fourteen. And on a Freudian account, **it’s not accidental that that’s the time you reach out for large and invisible fathers to protect you**… and mothers. And you know what, that’s elegant suspicion. It is not an argument; it’s an elegant suspicion. In fact when you look at the iconic significance of churches, you know the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, the family values stuff, you know… I mean, I hate to sound cynical, but as Freud says, they whole thing is so patently infantile. So obviously infantile, that **to anyone with the love of humanity it’s just sad to think that most people will never rise above this view of life**. Well, when you have had a snotty German talk to you that way, you begin to suspect that he may be right, and this is one of the masters of suspicion."](https://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/) ===:::
