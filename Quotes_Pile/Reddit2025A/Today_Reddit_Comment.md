"It's a fact. No evidence other than him constantly bowing to Putin is needed. Even if he wasn't one, he willingly acts like one."

"Clueless that Putin is far smarter than he is yet that's the weakness on Trump, thinking he's the most powerful person in the world when thinking it is not enough you have to act like it yet he does not know how to."

"It’s almost as if there’s a desire to promote white supremacy in the US as widely as possible, relishing the fact that it gets to appear on everyone’s front page over and over and over again. Meanwhile redditors choose to respond to it by trying to one up each other with cutesy cultural memes instead of refusing to accept this filth. Others ask “genuine questions” to have commenters spell out what’s actually going on here in black and white. This is Propaganda 101, people, and you are being played."
