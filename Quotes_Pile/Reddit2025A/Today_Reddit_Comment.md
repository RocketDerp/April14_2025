"
1) Reddit has become a lot more like Facebook in the past few years.  There is a lot more tolerance for low quality info in general.     

2) I think highly-viral info like this has a “frequency” or “seasonality”.  After an outbreak, eventually enough people will forget or move platforms, so the user base will become susceptible again."

"It's so sad how the USA has destroyed itself since Biden left office...

I really hope that the EU will keep building it's own defenses, while providing Ukraine the means to defend itself, because, in the end, what other choice do we have?

There is no compromise with a monster like Putin."

"Cults don’t think."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Extreme twitter-length thinking. This very message illustrates media cult behavior of 3 word length thinking to complex issues. Cults follow patterns of conditioned thinking, avoidng *free thinking*, further even if people are borrowing thinking from books and Twitter and Reddit and other media - a cult is often followers of only very specific books and not open to the entire public library. We need to be teaching comparative mythology in the face of what many people describe as widespread cults of Fox News media, etc. Somplistic statements like "they are in a cult" does not in any way rescue people or call for cult deprogramming. Why are mental health professions all across the world not using World Wide Web / social media to describe the proble and people on Reddit linking entire article instead of 3-word chanting (in the anti-MAGA media cults)? ===:::

"Troops being deployed everywhere - ramping up concentration camps. They're staging for a crackdown. I'm guessing we'll be waking up one morning to 10's of thousands of homeless (including the working homeless), and anyone protesting,  being rounded up and sent to the camps. The message will be comply or you'll be sent to the camps as well."

You want to kick start the new bloodiest conflict in American history, go spark it yourself. Everyone else seems to be relying on and exhausting all other options before taking an action that can never be taken back."

He would have on every tv in the house and every radio and it would be Fox News or some political show where they all yelled at each other and the radio was always right wing bullshit. 1) it was boring and obnoxious, 2) it was annoying, and 3) their arguments never made sense! “This Old House” was a reprieve since I wasn’t allowed to watch cartoons very often."

"Because they don't consider their interests to be what you consider their interests. They're not looking for better healthcare or good educations or futures. They live in places that have long since given up any hope. None of them have any dreams that the future will be brighter or that any policy will materially improve their lives.

All they want is to hurt the people they view as "the problem." They don't care that they're stuck in hell, as long as "the other" gets stuck in a worse hell."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Skywalker Ranch California lessons for Star Wars Audiences published in 1988 book Power of Myth: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. The myths of **participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile”—the person is not of the same order." - see also "infidel" word. ===:::

"Reduce it down even further than that.

They worship a diaper-wearing, industrial-spanx armored, shoe lift needing, face painted 80 year old spoiled brat bitch baby of two of the nastiest cousin kissing degenerate gamblers who injected the plight of their lessers directly into their veins.

Being a billionaire is nothing. They're not special anymore. Which means they like everything else. The moment they open their mouths to try to justify liking an orange, greasy, 80 year old spoiled brat white child, they're lying. They like having a dirty idiot grandpa tell them what to do. It's their kink."

And on a Freudian account, **it’s not accidental that that’s the time you reach out for large and invisible fathers to protect you**… and mothers. And you know what, that’s elegant suspicion. It is not an argument; it’s an elegant suspicion. In fact when you look at the iconic significance of churches, you know the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, the family values stuff, you know… I mean, I hate to sound cynical, but as Freud says, they whole thing is so patently infantile. So obviously infantile, that **to anyone with the love of humanity it’s just sad to think that most people will never rise above this view of life**. Well, when you have had a snotty German talk to you that way, you begin to suspect that he may be right, and this is one of the masters of suspicion."](https://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/) ===:::

We The People also seem to have lost sense that Trump was voted out of office for four years and addressing the Cambridge Analytica aftermath and media addiciton (descrbed by Neil Postman in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death") hasn't taken over society thinking and behaviors. ===:::

"The one thing that's stood out to me a lot recently is that there was a whole movement where they kept claiming that Obama was the Anti-Christ. And every accusation is a confession, of course.

I'm not religious, but if ever there were an Anti-Christ, Trump sounds an awful lot like him."

Why isn't "1 John 3:17" a household name / known verse since 2015 when Trump started to run for POTUS? Why isn't Matthew 6:5 being repeated and repeating from Christian Clergy all over the world about the Donald Trump $59.99 Bible selling and [famous posing in front of a Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church)?

"Have you ever watched Fox "News"?

It is genuinely batshit insane, unfiltered propaganda. Like always sensationalist, often utterly divorced from reality, and highly curated to increase outrage and a faux sense of self-righteousness alongside a very discrete set of marching orders for viewers to follow. It is genuinely hard for me to watch because it is so obviously manipulative, from the loaded framing of rhetorical questions and statements, the headlines/ticker reels they use being outlandishly inflammatory and unfactual, and the blatent lack of any sort of journalistic integrity amidst their elaborate editorialization. Just an entertainment channel masquerading as news that people erroneously consider a reliable source. 

It is on EVERYWHERE in the south and midwest. It is just playing, by default, in most any public space that has a television. It is on in restaurants and bars and diners. In hotel lobbies. They leave it on in their homes, playing on the TV endlessly. Just constant background noise. My aunt left it on and playing in the other room during Thanksgiving dinner. It is ALWAYS on. In the car there is Fox News Radio. A 24 "news" cycle, like a weird mental pacifier that leaves them the opposite of pacified, that they seek out like addictive bubblegum for their brain to passively chew while a fox host feeds them digested bits of filtered information and how best to "interpret" it. 

That is the problem. Genuinely, it's just Fox News. They have cut the legs out from under the 4th Estate. They are just the personal PR platform for a political Party that subverts the integrity of journalism and lies and misrepresents information CONSTANTLY in order to keep people that seek out no other source of information thinking that they are the only choice worth voting for, despite the obvious and repeated damage it does to them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Why hasn't social media stayed *focused and sustained* on this topic?

Why haven't we made Jen Senko a household name?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad) A *baby boomer* stood up to Fox News - why are we not using her leadership to rally around? Why can't we on social media repeat and keep repeating: Stand Up For Little Guy? Instead, we flock to The Big Guy crushing The Little Guy... Rupert Murdoch and Trump and Musk media systems. Again, why hasn't social media made Jen Senko a household name? THINK ABOUT IT! ===:::
