"It's shocking how quickly the US turned into Russia and it's even more shocking how their own people are cheering for it"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica deployed hard-core mental manipulation starting in March 2013. Several years before the November 2016 election win by Donald Trump. People do not take seriously the behavior changes in USA population. Terse, flippant, dismissive, avoidant of nonfiction. Donald Trump entertainer is valued above nonfiction sincere leaders. People compulsively spend all their free time and spare time insulting, mocking, name-calling, mimicking Donald Trump. Attracted to the total mockery unlike any other area of life. Donald Trump is bigger than all the top 10 video games, all the top 10 films, all the top ten sports events COMBINED in how much people can not resist mocking and insulting the Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People do not want to face up how Saudi Arabia and Mecca operate, how Putin and Surkov use antics politics in Russia, etc. Motivating a population to murder neighbors in Ukraine is no small feat. Being a killer, blood on your hands, is no minor life experience. Russia has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014 and the people of Russia are so programmed and conditioned that it keeps going on and on. USA people have been more and more attracted to, flocking to, self-harm and dehumanization with Trump. The behaviors are in your face. People will not stop mocking, insulting, name-calling,dehumanizing "the others" in USA. Every day, the same attractions. ====:::

"So coverage here in Denmark, is that DR (danish national media) has uncovered a plot with 3 individuals with close ties to Trump, operating in Greenland trying to create false narratives, that would hurt the Greenlandic relationship with Denmark, with the goal of creating a Greenlandic “independence movement” in support of Trump taking over.

It violates several international laws, and will probably hurt ties between Denmark and the US further, unfortunately."

"
> I have no idea why so much of the MAGA-sphere thinks you win arguments by being louder.

It's not about winning arguments. They just want to shut down the opposition so they effectively give up. If you look at US politics right now, it seems to work, too. How many times have you rolled your eyes at something the president did or said in the last DAY and just not engaged because you knew exactly how the conversation would go anyway. I won't pretend I haven't been there."

"Do you know what the hardest thing is though? How fucking exhausting it is. If you have a shred of integrity you'll want to provide evidence for your arguments or takedowns. Rebuffing a single talking point can take hours of research, then more time to digest it and form a cohesive argument. So much time and effort, doing their research for them, and it's exhausting.

These chucklefucks though? They're not burdened with facts or reason.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Original thinking is far overrated. People flock to trending and jump on board bandwagons constantly. The problem is WHAT they flock to. Instead of flocking to authentic goodness values like Malala's reformations of sexual relations in Pakistan, people flock to Donald Trump's anti-education anti-comprehension anti-empathy anti-goodness. People flock to fiction storytelling of Fox News and Donald Trump, not to science and talking points. Same with ChatGTP and GrokAI - the fiction "hallucinations" they produce is incredibly popular with consumers / audiences. People do not see, authentic sharing of factual reality. "Sleep Joe Biden" is not entertaining for audiences, trash Tony Clifton performances by Donald Trump and others ells far more. Sober Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" can't be faced by people addicted to antics politics and fiction. People flock to entertainment, amusement, often LOL LOL LOL at the suffering of other people. Death-wishing draw an audience. The what people repeat is unoriginal and hate-filled. ===:::

"In my experience as a teacher, one of the biggest red flags that someone is going to have a hard time in life is that they struggle to understand analogies, satire, hypotheticals, thought experiments, etc...

"Well you also gotta remember how much sanewashing conservative media does of Trump. Most of these folks have never seen anything except curated excerpts of his speeches, or screenshots of his "good" (ie: less insane) Tweets on Facebook. Hopefully this actually has people not just look at themselves, but actually look at Trump outside of the small bubble that's been constructed around them.

“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard?

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in **the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming**, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995 ===:::

He's laid off thousands of federal workers, all over the nation, which not only means workers that will be unemployed BUT also cripples the government's ability to function AND the benefits the public gets from the government.

"I am just an armchair economist watching things unfold and I think this recession could be the big one, possibly so damaging and prolonged that it actually upends the US as the global economic leader and hands the mantle to China.

Everyone knows there is a recession every 10-15 years. Companies get too greedy, lie to inflate valuations, they cut jobs and expenses too much and the whole thing collapses.

This has become a fairly accepted cycle in the business world and on Wall St.

Whenever this would happen the adults would step in, create some regulations and let things slowly rebuild.

The problem is there are no more adults in the room. Trump is starting trade wars with historic allies and driving up the costs of all products for seemingly no gains. They have fired the stats people from the labor board because they didn't like the numbers (and would prefer to publish fake ones that make things seem great). They are beginning a wholesale assault on the Fed, the last bastion of sanity and hope for an economic recovery and will do eventually replace JPow with some talking head from TV that Trump likes but has no idea what they are doing.

There is a good chance that the US/Trump will lean towards the Turkish economic policy of inflation doesn't exist and if it did it will just balance itself out and that will cause a catastrophic spiral downwards"

Suggesting he’s weak and stupid is simply a way to promote inaction. He’s dangerous and if he was weak, you should go stop him right now."

"Of course it's not a joke. All this guy craves is power, money, and attention. He craves it like oxygen. You think this MFer cares about leadership? The Constitution? Consent? HELL NO.

My only question is how the freedom-loving, "don't tread on me" flag waving, "we the people" truck sticker having rubes are falling over themselves to kiss the ring of a wanna be dictator? Ask them how they'd feel if that dictator were someone, say, like Barack Obama? Would they suddenly change their tune when it's not one of theirs?

I don't ever want to hear about freedom again. I have to suppress a gag reflex every time there's a national anthem at a sporting event. I laugh out loud every time I see an eagle painted over an American flag on the back of some slap dick's truck window, like an angry chicken staring at me.

Just a matter of time until technology invents even easier ways for one person to murder and kill others in mass. Keep passing down to over 8 billion people that violence is good. Simplstic thinking. May as well stop investigating airplaine crashes and making cars safer, because if you don't deal with the pscyological problems of human brains and artifical intelligence finding that violence is the answer - terrorism will become the outcome from human beings who already terrorize the air / water / animals of the Earth.
