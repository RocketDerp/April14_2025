Those who die for Quran and Mecca and Mosque, Islamic Terrorists, are suicide by science fiction storytelling cult. That is what Putin and Trump and Cambridge Analytica mastered since March 2013. And we must educate every person age 12 to age 120 in the entire world on media ecology and comparative mythology (science fiction history, monomyth vs. monomyth story patterns in human mind) to defend against the self-destruction. 5,000 patterns of science fiction alternate reality were deployed by Russia: "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета".

"It is absolutely sped up for the first part of the video until she is close to going off the road. How can you not tell this is sped up just by looking at her head movement? Her head looks like it is being fast forwarded, because it is. You can also look at the time in the bottom right corner, the seconds are going up much faster all the way until 22:10 where it then goes to normal speed because she’s about to go off road.

This isn’t an argument, it is objectively, 100% sped up. Multiple things make that very obvious."

"You already answered your own implied question: They don't think. I know so many people that view everything from the standpoint of what they gain from an action, not what they RISK with an action. It's a fundamentally different mindset, and chasing dopamine is DESIGNED to make you not think about consequences. Thinking about things in terms of risk FORCES you to think about things, because the first thing you are going to think is: I don't like risk. How do I make risk go away? And now you're thinking about it..."

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, 2019 ===:::

"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, **creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action." - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ ===:::

"Yes, but the only reason Roosevelt is there is so they can claim it wasn't done purely to stroke Trump's ego. It's a weak argument because it's comparing a historical president who can't politically benefit from the display of a message to a present one that can.

Normally political leaders in a democracy opt out of that kind of outlandish glorification at government expense while in office. It looks too much like North Korea or something. The most they usually get is a small official portrait hung in government offices."

They get off on causing suffering and pain, and the weaker the victim, the better. So of course they're going to be pedos.

"Buying the lie is not about being a moron, it’s about the lie being a power move. Most of Trump’s appeal is that he’s strong, so he can say any lie he wants. The more blatant the lie is the better, because accepting a blatant lie just further proves how strong he is. And if you don’t accept it then you’re outed as not being a true conservative.

It can be really hard from the outside to understand the conservative mindset, because it looks like conservatives are simultaneously believing contradictory things, sometimes within the same sentence. We throw around terms like cognitive dissonance, but no matter how much they’ve drunk the cool-aid for that to be cognitive dissonance would be wild.

But it’s not cognitive dissonance because it’s not about belief, just like with everything else with conservatives it’s about posturing and hierarchy. The lies aren’t actually lies, they’re power moves. And repeating them isn’t about believing them, it’s about solidifying your place in the hierarchy. It’s communication, but it’s not about communicating ideology, it’s a pack of dogs posturing submissiveness to the alpha."

"Why did they get convicted and disappeared during Trump’s first term, and then Trump kept hinting for four years of all the people in those files at every rally.

You would think from the first term, he’d know what was in the files, and NOT talk about them.

And now, since he says “I told the FBI about him”, so one congressman said “yes, he’s in the files, because he tipped off the FBI.

Bullshit. He WAS the FBI for the first term, and never thought to say he turned in Epstein himself?"

"That's exactly the danger with people like Joe Rogan. They represent themselves as ideologically neutral and openminded to different points of view, and the dumb fucks who listen think that the kooks they platform have an equally valid views as actual subject matter experts. I know someone who went down a right wing rabbit hole because she listened to shows like Rogan and Bill Maher looking for a "balanced" view."

"Watching the fall of the Rome (USA) has been an interesting sight, they labeled their pretorian guard after the most disgusting part of the Nazi regime (SS). They sold their liberty to their enemies gladly for money (like the Greeks who sold out for byzantine emperors). It has been interesting watching how they turned from liberty for all to all hail the emperor, they got nothing in exchange but they stilled applauded.

Like the romans they had influence around the world but once they fractured and turned their focus on interior squabbles, it disappeard. As it almost entirely made up stuff to grab power one quote resonates in my mind. A quote from John Milton "I rather rule in hell than serve in heaven". But as the roman empire did, the American followed. They both fell inevitable into disparity and disrepair.

Bye bye America as number one in cultural export, they are no longer number one in anything and most of Amerika fell below most third world countrys in almost all statistics (already has)."

"Trump is addicted to money. The more you have, the more important. Putin is the richest man on the planet. Trump looks up to him. Good chance Mr. Trump sex fetish with beautiful girls and women, was satisfied by the Russian state and is documented by the same. Maybe this is why the little private meetings take place between the two, off mic and camera. Trump needs to be reminded he has a daddy"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Donald Trump is addicted to egoism. He is a magnet for egomania. Trump is entirely addicted to television and has been his entire lifetime, since childhood. Trump went into casinos for the entertainment side of the business, not for profit, but to learn how to manipulate crowds with entertainment addiction. Donald Trump playing NYC Tony Clifton performances blended with Surkov screenplays https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/ is his life dream. He gets constant attention while everyone eats the Clifton act. He barely sleeps, can't wait to start staging his next Clifton performance, Trump works incredibly hard as an entertainer on constant tour. Social media eats right out of Putin and Trump's hands. ===:::

"No, the US is done. There won't be a time republicans and conservatives admit what they've done to our nation. They will continue to live in loony world. The rest of the world will move on and isolate the failed nation of the USA. Europeans have stopped parcel shipments to the US. The rest of the world is recruiting top US scientists. There isn't going to be a time where US regains sanity because it would take the right to admit they fucked up. They will not."

"The problem we have now is they're breaking shit everywhere at every level. While it would be nice to oust the ones in government,.. That may take a decade or more to fully re-set (back to staff at various levels who have any ethics and actually follow laws)

But then what. We've still got groups like Proud Boys and 3 percenters and even just unaffiliated individuals who have hateful beliefs. You know the guy in the big lifted pickup truck that feels emboldened to "roll coal" and drive dangerously. How do we fix that ?

You know that old adage about how "A lie makes it around the world before the Truth even gets its boots on". This is basally the physical manifestation of that. People can tear things down faster than good ethical people can build things up. How do you get back to a society that values the hard sweaty work of "building things up" and "lifting others".

The currently popular ideology seems to be "tear things down and be cruel and selfish"."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Yes. Parenting in Palestine. Getting married in Palestine in October 2021 and having your first child in June 2023 leads to a terrible nightmare. People all around you in Palestine are organizing a terror attack on Isreal the morning of October 7, 2023 (Putin's birthday) and from that day forward your life is Hell. At least the Hell hasn't stopped at the end of August 2025 when I write this commentary. Parenting in Palestine is constant stress. Donald Trump leadership of the USA is constant stress if you don't think fiction and chaos are awesome entertainment for you and the future of children. ===:::
