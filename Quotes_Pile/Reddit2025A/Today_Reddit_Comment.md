"It's going to flip flop around idiotic figures in a downward spiral that leads to idiotism paralyzing any meaningful political progress in your country. Every new administration will have to remove everything from that before."

"Why lie about every issue? Being in favor of crime is demented, let’s see how that ages."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-think Bluesky-length thinking. Politicians who are dishonest and manipulate We The People is a crime. "Demented" plauing on "Dementia Donnie" topic. "like about every issue", constant deception claim. Perfect 100% falsehoods is impossible, nobody can be perfect correct or perfectl false. What one can be is perfectly banal. Short tiny comment messages that manipulate the mind into perfection of always bieng shallow and superficial. But you can't always be correct 100% or always be wrong 100%. ===:::

"No. He has a 38% approval rating. 60% disapproval."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : When dealing with Tony Clifton performances, you add these two numbers together. Total engagement is what matters. 38% + 60% = 98%.

"To me one of the most chilling parts of 1984, and one that to me explains a lot of the conservative/authoritarian mindset, is when O'Brien explains to Smith that making someone else suffer is the only way to make sure you have power over them: after all, how can you know you are imposing your will on someone else if they just comply? For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them. That is the point of cruelty for its own sake as weaponized by conservatives ans authoritarians."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : USA people are spending all their spare time and free time commenting and discussing the Tony Clifton performance. The addiction to the Clifton show and techniques is so extreme that even after 10 years people keep craving and calling for more. "Sleepy Joe Biden" was way too boring performance for meme addeled media addiction nation. ===:::

"This regime won’t lose a single supporter over this. Talking heads for billionaire oligarchs clutched their pearls when Hillary called Trump’s supporter’s deplorable but she was right.

Anyone still supporting Trump at this point is a bad person. Cruelty is the point and this is exactly what they voted for."

"The media long ago decided that you can’t accurately describe Republicans’ beliefs and actions without sounding terribly biased, so they chose not to do that."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This was a core focus of the Russian IRA: [Gatov, who is the former head of Russia's state newswire's media analytics laboratory, told BuzzFeed the documents were part of long-term Kremlin plans to swamp the internet with comments. "Armies of bots were ready to participate in media wars, and the question was only how to think their work through," he said. "Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers."](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america) - same goes for social media users. Get people addicted to fiction. This problem (crisis) is not in any way unique to the Republican party and United States of America - it is a human brain issue globally. Fiction outsells nonfiction. "The media" includes Reddit, memes and tarsh content, Bluesky trash content. Neil Postman in 1985 published a book titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death' that discusses *the media* problem of audiences being amused all the time, LOL hilarious to Donald Trump and others playing Tony Clifton acts. ===:::

"This administration believes how they've handled this entire debacle makes them look strong when it's actually made them look completely inept, unorganized and just plain cruel. Amazing that anyone would want to still support this dumbass President but hey here we are."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Classical thinking. Completely outdated thinking. This is eating the Surkovian onions. Proclaiming that chaos and nonsense is *accidental*, completely ignorant of Cambridge Analytica plot to break america and how Surkov governing techniques have worked for Putin power the past 25 years. 2019 :    
“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to **instill chaos through society** so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ... ... ... 
"This administration believes how they've" created content for Reddit users to mock and call Tony Clifton act dumb idiot fools. Putin and Trump are running circles around the ENTIRE USA population who can't cite  Christopher Wylie and others (Neil Postman, etc). ===:::

"To anyone paying attention, putting buffoons in charge that send ongoing live military and actions to reporters in accident should have demonstrated everything we need to know about this administration.

They're dangerously incompetent.

Everyone who knows what they're doing has left the building."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  [Another meme addeled eater of Surkovian onions who claims this is "incompetent" application of Surkov Kremlin technqiues](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md). Doesn't comprehend that "everyone who knows what they're doing has left the building" - is a win for Putin and the intended outcome of Russian informaiton warfare. Another social media meme addict who can't be bothered to read books that have been sitting on the shelf for over a decade on how modern Russia operates. Conditioned reaction. ===:::

"The dems ran a shit campaign but the voters failed. Trump ran a campaign on hating on your neighbors and dismantling democracy and the voting public loved that shit. Its not like Trump's relationship with Epstein or his predatory behavior towards young women/underaged girls were a secret either. All of that shit was outted during his first term and voters were able to overlook all of that."

"Biden was an idiot and a clown, and so were his advisors. Nominating a Republican AG because he was slighted by congress over the SCOTUS role is something only a staffer whose whole worldview is informed by the West Wing would come up with."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Americans mock Americans, Americans calling other Americans idiot and clown all the time in August 2025 total mockery. Russian IRA did not just attack MAGA and Republicans, it was TOTAL SOCIEETY, INCLUDING Democrats, including Biden himself. USA population is in mass psychosis. Total psycologicla denial, unable to face **year 1985 nonfiction book** by Neil Postman and others that describe addiction to media systems. Russia won, Putin won, Surkov won since March 2013. ===:::

"Agree with the first part, disagree with the second. This wasn’t Biden sundowning. This is the action of some extremely online Twitter liberal staffers who post that sipping tea gif in response to stuff like “Donald Drumpf isn’t actually a billionaire”. It’s the type of move that someone who thinks AG Garland would make a good scene in a movie would choose. Someone else convinced an already decaying Biden that this move would unite both sides of the aisle and then everyone would clap and dance together."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : yes. Focus on the media consumption and Twitter-thinking. We The People can't even face up to the Fox News crisis and be serious, let alone every social media platform full of shit reaction messaging. ===:::

When you have media power, no rules apply, if you can wave around the Quran in Saudi Arabia and run the Mecca science fiction theme park - anything goes. ===:::

"People somehow twisted themselves into knots that he and entertainers are progressive because they talk about sex and drugs, but no they don't talk about any of that in a positive way. He's long made deeply misogynistic music. The fact that a guy who has been that bad towards women also is a bigot towards gay people is not shocking.

And it turns out that a lot of conservative men of all stripes have harmful views of both women and gay people."

"I feel like the standard for tech billionaires being evil has just shifted dramatically. Like Bill Gates is just an evil businessman, and maybe back then that was the worst of the worst, but these days the worst tech billionaires might as well be supervillains. These days the tech billionaires want to build company towns to virtually enslave their workers, create a surveillance state, fire as many workers as possible and replace them with AI, etc. which in comparison makes Gates look very run of the mill."
