"There's gotta be an element of extreme cognitive dissonance involved. I refuse to believe that close to 50% of voters are ok with child abuse.

In order to beat them, you need to understand them. They just truly, honestly somehow believe it's a conspiracy and lies. They've lied to themselves that thoroughly.

That's why arguing with them about it seems like you're arguing against a brick wall. Because to them you are spouting nonsense. That's what they hear."

"Trump lies about the weather when we can all see the rain with our own eyes, and feel the raindrops falling on our heads.

And then he gets upset that people don't accept his lies and he reacts as if he is the the victim of betrayal."

"Lol, gotta say man, half the stuff comin' outta Trump's mouth feels like it'd fit better in a stand-up comedy show than a political platform."

"I'm not even sure how the Onion is still around. This administration is like satire of itself."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "What this film is going to suggest is that that defeatist response has become a central part of a new system of political control. And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time. Surkov is one of President Putin's advisers, and has helped him maintain his power for 15 years, but he has done it in a very new way. He came originally from the avant-garde art world, and those who have studied his career, say that what Surkov has done, is to import ideas from conceptual art into the very heart of politics." - December 31, 2014 - more than a decade ago. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html ===:::

"His supporters admire him for it.

The same far right-wing people I knew had no issues lusting after high schoolers and talking about their friend's daughters' looks or breasts.

Hang out with one when a high school lets out. Watch their eyes."

"Our government has willfully given the controls of the masses to a few oligarchs and intelligence officials. Our democracy is dead. We are nothing but a legally hallowed out corpse that sociopathic oligarchs get to wear and parade around as a mask."

"Yeah I don't know how anyone can think that Ballmer is some kind of visionary. A lot of mythos around tech billionaires is way overstated in general but many of them at least actually did build something. Ballmer was just an early employee that rose to the top of an already very successful company and his wealth is predicated not only on the working class like many others but on other people's visions as well."

"The conflict isn't left vs right. It's up vs down

EDIT: I acknowledge that many people on the right are duped into supporting the rich by wedge social issues. I can only hope they realize they're being used before it's too late"

"I think too many believe the system is fine, its just they are getting a raw deal through bad luck, conspiracy against them, whatever. We are prolific at manufacturing excuses.

More than that, though, its that people do not understand the system, don't care to learn, and just accept it is what it is and try to figure out how to fill their lives with copes and distractions enough to deaden the pain of failure and apathy. Ironic we're discussing this in a venue for hyper plugged in NBA fans who need constant discussion to get their fix."

"This is a blinkered view of political analysis. It's not a "purity test" or egotistical to evaluate the political valence of a particular political party in a world historical perspective. With your framework,  it's impossible to say that the dominant political parties have drifted rightwards. 

Saying up vs down is more accurate is absurd. There are plenty of right wing narratives that use this format and they are 100% wrong."

"There isn’t. When the left-right spectrum came into being it was describing constitutional monarchists vs. outright absolutist monarchists. Those terms have literally always been flexible, because they describe political realities, not a specific set of political policies."

"Thats not what the people above wants us to think. the right targets those who are vulnerable and poor to manipulate so that they can be used as a shield to continue to accumulate massive wealth and power. Just look at what fox news is doing. They lie all day and hide the truth and faces no consequence."

"It's too late and they won't. The bourgeoise convincing the rest of us to focus on left vs right was the game plan all along. The right is screaming about gender and race and the left is trying to move on from that but being held down by the same issues over and over again."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The formal announcement was made December 2013, right before the February 2014 Ukraine invasion.
"Vladimir Putin is calling on the conservatives of the world to unite—behind him. The Kremlin leader's full-throated defense of Russia's "traditional values" and his derision of the West's "genderless and infertile" liberalism in his annual state-of-the-nation address last week was just the latest example of Putin attempting to place himself at the vanguard of a new "Conservative International."

"I know a lot of VC and tech guys, and even the biggest tech bro you'll ever meet admits Balmer is a clown and owes his entire fortune to the housing selection committee at Harvard. Microsoft under his direction was adrift and his tenure was the era that Apple took over the consumer hardware space after being reduced to the absolute fringes previously. I have never heard anyone talk about Balmer and some sort of visionary."
