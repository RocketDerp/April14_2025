"This is just plain false. This is absolutely being covered by major western media networks.

The people who complain about something "not being covered by western media" are usually the ones who don't even watch the news or read online newspapers. Often, they only get their news from Reddit or other social media, so when something isn't on the front page of Reddit or being spammed on Twitter, they think nobody else is covering it."

"Yes, one of the many tragic features of the current regime in DC is that its propaganda makes the world feel so small, like the only thing that matters is that fucking guy."

"you guys are stupid if you think the United States has any control over what Israel does. The relationship does not work like that, Israel doesn't know whatever it wants with American tax payer money. Then uses the United States to clean it up"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Israel and USA population consumes the same science fiction story "Torah" with Adam / Eve / Moses (Bible front section, "Old Testiment" in the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible) and think they have common values and grounds. It is like the audience of fiction Fox News finding themselves in agreement because people watched the same entertainment Fox News story that same week. There is an absence of media ecology self-awareness of how media consumption (John 1:1) influences feelings of having something in common with mindsets. ===:::

"Man this is vile

They are trying to sabotage the hostage deal. By launching an attack on qatari soil (qatar is an intermediator between hamas/israel) they want the qatari to pull out of the negotiations and thus the israeli can say qatar is to blame for the hostages not being released.

https://www.timesofisrael.com/security-chiefs-negotiators-us-said-all-blaming-netanyahu-for-tanking-hostage-talks/

Article: Security chiefs, negotiators, US all said blaming Netanyahu for tanking hostage talks

This has happened before. The hostages could have been home over a year ago. But the Israelis want the genocide to continue.

This also covers up yesterday drone attack in the sumud flotilla. I wouldn't be surprised if the had a third attack in bound to iran or somewhere else.

Edit: its confirmed, they killed the hamas head negotiator."

"In this political chaos nobody seems to give a flying fuck anymore. It’s only going to get worse."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Of course **people care**, this bullshit of "nobody seems to give a flying fuck anymore" is incredibly shallow and lacking self-awareness. Social media users are flocking to the topic like flies to shit. War and action violence is entertainment to people who avoid serious discussion of the education / comprehension problems in society. Media addicts of Reddit can't wait to get notification of breaking news events to engage on social machines of Reddit. People give a HUGE SHIT to it like sporting events and famous entertainers like Reality TV star "The Apprentice" show coverage. Sports team Torah vs. sports team Quran live coverage! Fiction story vs. fiction story fighting it out! Sports fanatics with sports mentality. ===:::

"It’s not an air fleet. It’s a glorified gas station.

This article is idiotic. They’d be just as justified writing an article calling out Shell for letting ice vans get gas at their stations."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The story has major name recognition, status symbol icons in the mind. Popularity. Media addicts are not self-aware of their own compusive attraction to language symbolism / brand names / big names. ===:::

"After Trump became president, Putin has become emboldened to carry out strikes against civilians at a whole new level because he knows Trump will never retaliate."

"No they aren't next. Putin has been prepping a Baltic invasion for many years, has been clear on his aspirations. Even before Finland joined nato, Baltics was always next. Its not really up for discussion, we know what he wants. Baltics have much larger Russian populations than Finland, that's probably the biggest reason. They also fit better in line with his their tactical aspirations, joining st Petersburg up with Kalinigrad. Then there are historic reasons, returning the Soviet block."

"It's kind of the same for my country (Israel). Far-right/Jewish supremacist/fascist people (whichever way you may want to address them) were gleeful when the US election results came out, and became far more open about their views/goals (they were always genocidal morons).

I think it's happening in many other nations, sadly."

"The disconnect from reality of this comment is genuinely concerning. He literally was emboldened enough to invade under Biden and there were hundreds of civilian strikes. Reddit has lost the plot."
