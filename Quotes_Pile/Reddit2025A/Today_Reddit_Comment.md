"No, they are connected to how many people were killed that were working for western organizations. Last time there was an apology was the WCK bombing. Now the journalists that were killed were working for western publications."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users could be organizing sending thousands of inexpensive smartphoens with SD cards to haeve *everyday people* record video of events and have multiple people show what is happening. In an information war - document how people are starving and being bombed. Organize pickup locations for SD cards every 12 hours and a system to publish the videos from Amman Jordan or other neary by Internet stable location. This has been going on since October 2023 and social media society is not organizing to show thousands of indepenent *non-professional* people given a democratic voice in the situation. People are not asserting Malala's excellent ideas about terrorism on social media. Instead, people react to Israel over and over and over, reactionary thinking. Anti-progress thinking. Social media society has all the signs of beig media addicted to the daily news events and not actually haing copassion for EVERYDAY people being given voice like Malala's focus on EVERYDAY people being given voice through education and stable information systems (stable education / learning systems). ===:::

"The consequences are they lost their moral high ground forever now. Every time going forward there's a 'oh the holocaust' people will parallel it to what Israel is doping in Gaza. People are realising this has been going on, to a lesser extent than today, but for the last 70 years.

From what they are doing now Israel will lose a bunch of global support, possibly even USA over time. While they enjoy a powerful position in ME today, without big brother to arm and defend them things could really change over the longer term.

From that even with ethics and humanitarian reasons aside, this has been a horrible decision by Netanyahu, They get a little more land but the people will always be on the other side of the fence and now their global support will shrink."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think media addicts are entertained by horror films, wars footage, video of suffering, photographs of others suffering and being terrorized. Content creation is what many people favor over compassion and love. Addicts to media reacting to every event of war, not calling for Malala's **nonfiction** solutions to end war - but instead react-commenting on Reddit and other media platforms and media systems keeps audiences glued to streaming information devices. ==:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Americans can't fight Russia's Internet Research Agency since March 2013. Anti-intellectual gun-stroking gun worship American values. So conditioned that violence solves problems. Domestic violence being encouraged constantly when we are dealing with media addiction problems. Social media users won't do the one thing that addresses Fox News (Rupert Murdoch) addiction problems; Stand up for Jen Senko's film. Stand up and teach nonfiction educaiton about fiction addiction. Addiction to hate, horror, "The Purge" fiction, etc. Social media addicts keep repeating their cravings for horror content, nightmares, violence action films instead of addresing that MAGA is driven by systemic violence (D.O.G.E. dehumanization, USAid removal dehumanization, hate promotion, anti-empahty, anti-compassion). Addicts to media don't want to teach about media ecology and media addiction and address the Russian information warfare since March 2013. Craving for violence and action images abounds. ===:::

Okies are seeing some of the most negative impacts from Trump and GOP policies and they are still waving their MAGA flags. There are far too many people whose only political agenda is harming those they have been conditioned to hate by rightwing media."

Putin's rightwing media. "Дональд решил пригласить для этой задачи - специальный научный отдел "Кембриджского университета". Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа." And people keep remarking that media caused the hate but don't want to pick up books about media itself (Neil Postman's library) and start addressing the problem. Jen Senko's film rots on the shelf and people make Reddit comments over and over without seeing the forest for the trees of NATO loss of an information war to Russia. ===:::

"The cratering of the economy is intentional. When the smaller businesses go belly-up they will be bought out for pennies on the dollar by larger corporations which will charge higher rates for shittier service and then blame woke or DEI for the business failing. But they will simply declare bankruptcy and move on to the next. The US is entering the second Gilded Age. It will be probably 20-30 years before it recovers, if it ever does. Multiple generations will be lost to indentured servitude to corporations. But the leaders will lie and the corporate media will lap at those lies and spread them breathlessly to stay in the good graces of the Führer. Truth is lost. Facts mean nothing."

"Ah, it’s hard to know, but yeah, women tend to be very vindictive and often don’t show the same level of comradery as male teams.

For me, I remember that if anything like that happened, you were expected to confront the person as a team, and if there was a scuffle, the whole team had to be involved. That’s how we were trained. Never allow the other team to bully you, but also never be the aggressor.

Antagonizing is appreciated tho... so it's a thin line.

With all that said, intentionally targeting the setter during warm-up is literally the biggest sin you can commit in volleyball, and it usually culminates in scuffles or fights.

You would always get punished for losing your temper, but you would be punished even more if you dont have your teammate's back.

At my level this would likely mean a DQ for the other team or red card for the player who did this.

You simply cannot do it, because you can concuss them. Volleyball can do real damage, and when you strike at average speeds above 100 km/h, you don’t get a chance to react. It feels like a sucker punch and can eliminate you from the game.

It always interests me that this stuff happens in the NBA or Volleyball, and the difference in reactions between men and women is very apparent. I’m assuming it has a lot to do with coaching culture."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : military training techniques work on Japanese in 1942, Germans in 1942, Russians in 1942. Military techniques are practiced without educating the population on how they work and operae. Now we live in a world where Russian military an Cambridge Analytica has mind-fucked everyone with bonding techniques of out-group hate. Gender lines of out-group hate, rape and pillage, are part of military practices all over the world in 1940's techniques. The attraction to Putin and Trump is attraction to mass dehumanization and out-group mockery. Meme addicts can't resist the total mockery Putin and Trump created since March 2013 using information systems warfare. ===:::

"I've got a theory that some people think being smart is just being contrarian, like just claiming the opposite all the time. I think this might be because they get corrected by smarter people a lot, so that's their perception. To them, being smart isn't about actually being factually correct, it's just saying "nuh uh" and "akschully".

Also, I think there is a lot of past propaganda, like hard decisions have to be made, these few people must die so more can live, etc. But it's all purely reactionary, the thought ending random claim. Like American marketing had convinced the populace that there's always two sides of the truth, but you know, sometimes one side is Nazis and just objectively wrong."

"This is 100% it. And it’s why we’re fucked because they have trained themselves to never agree with anyone, especially people they do not like.

US culture has largely propagated this phenomenon due to how “cool”, “smart” or “manly” characters are portrayed in art and film. They’re usually witty and clever, and will verbally eviscerate anyone that dares challenge their morality or intellect, usually in a flashy or humorous way.

All these idiots are trying to be Deadpool or the Joker but they forget that requires actual charisma, humor, and intelligence. Because if you don’t have those you just come off as an over-confident brainless douche.

I’ve heard a lot of terms for these type of people like “know it alls” or “one-uppers” but I just call them assholes because all they do is spew shit at people and act shitty to everyone. Just shit people all around."

So I suspect when the US is no longer the largest economy in the world, historians will point to this as the biggest reason."
