"Ya know, the shittiest part of this is that even though that dude is an utterly useless asshat I will still fight for his right to survive.

I'm so tired of these fuckalls who suck from the government teat and complain about the government offering other people besides them assistance as well."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We have a massive media ecology crisis described 40 years ago in Neil Postman's year 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To DeatH" about television news systems. Adult education isn't optional. We need to educate people why Fox News is wrong, we can't keep leeting rural uneducated adults in USA not comrprehend how Facbook, Fox News, Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter works on their mind. Russia won, Surkov won the information war since March 2013 because we did not educate rural Americans with media ecology. Neil Postman's 1985 book was essential for the smartphone age, and we did not teach it to every adult. ===:::

"The only reason I wish I was still on X is to see all the people replying to this moron telling him he did, in fact, vote for this."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit user commenting may not be on X / Twitter media platform, but the message they created on Reddit is Twitter-like and short-length Tweet-thinking. Just telling people "you voted for this" and sitll having them vote for the next fiction storyteller to feed their fiction addiciton to short simplistic Twitter-style ideas does not address the problem in any way, shape, or form. Neil Postamn's **book is only 184 pages, a SOCIETY WIDE education campaign to get EVERY PERSON on the SAME PAGE** of the 184 page book "Amusing OUrselves To Death" - ALL PEOPLE, age 12 to age 120, NEED TO LEARN. Just saying "you voted for this" is not in any way addressing the underlying cause of the Russian win of the information war. Moscow won, Surkov won! ===:::
