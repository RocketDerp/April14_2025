* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And those years of Fox News messaging (Obama coming on to world stage, campaigh for POTUS 2007 onward), content, were put inside the minds of Fox News audience. Then in March 2013, Russia (working with Cambridge Analytica) mastered the Internet messaging techniques of filliping values in the human mind. Inverting and framing things as us. vs. them... USA vs. USA, not USA vs. Russia. ["At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation." - September 9, 2014 (more than a decade ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/) ===:::

"What the actual fuck. I've been trying to reserve my outrage at all of the daily horrendous shit this admin pulls, but when the administration says "there is no limit to the authority of the President" that's just some of the fucking most traitorous un-American shit I've ever heard.

Not to be some Gadsen-flag-flying cockwomble, but America's government is supposed to be limited in very specific and sometimes vague ways. The authority of any one branch is government is supposed to be limited by the other two branches on a regular basis. The authority of the government is supposed to be limited very specifically to protect people's civil rights. Even the most conservative, elitist, racist, sexist men from the founding wanted a rule of law and guaranteed fair trials, limited arresting power to terrorize citizens, and a presumptuin of innocence.

Obviously execution of those and excuses for why blacks and women (& others) haven't been considered "citizens" consistently has been key in the struggle, but they are just saying wrong, traitorous shit right now."

"It was not the "Lolita Express." That plane was destroyed.

It was another plane that Epstein used to own. It was auctioned off and was purchased by a plane chartering company. Trump's plane, while on the campaign trail, had to get grounded for a week or something. His campaign reached out to a private chartering company to rent a plane. That plane happened to be one of Epstein's planes that was auctioned off and purchased by the chartering company."

"This really gets to the heart of our problem as a country. 30+ years of talk radio, fox news, and social media hatemongering has made a part of the country view their own countrymen as sub-human enemies.

Central American concentration camps dont matter, rape doesnt matter, killing democracy doesnt matter... because its just 'democrats'. They arent "Americans I disagree with" or even "Human beings that deserve basic decency" . They are enemies, who deserve every evil that can be inflicted upon them.

Republicans have gotten so tribal and so hate filled that there is no bottom. There is no voice left that says "We are better than this. This behavior is beneath us". And now Foxs News Grandpa is in charge... the unrestricted hateful id of millions of frightened and angry people who have never set foot in America's cities are champing at the bit to wipe them out to save a version of America that exists only in their minds.

Wasting the free time, the spare time, that Reddit users have. Exaclty as Neil Postman's 1984 book says: "Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism." - which describes Reddit activity in year 2025 back in 1985 language, Reddit didn't even go online until yaer 2005... but Postman saw the problem and accurately described the outcomes before he died. Mocking back at Joe Rogan is not resisting Joe Rogan.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social machine consumers of 2025 (chanting "Epstein", "Epstein" constantly in August 2025) in their race to be terse, short-messages popularity (like Twitter / Bluesky / SMS), don't even speak up that *"falling in love"* with an age 14 child that you see in passing at a public event for only minutes is not *love* at all. You rarely see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism by emphasizing that **the behavior is actually "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination"** to better describe how predators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of society), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the meaning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "[A Subaru Car is love](https://www.motor1.com/news/142732/subaru-love-ad-campaign/)" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values. Donald Trump knows exactly what he is doing with his lifetime association with McDonald's marketing / logo / brands / slogans. Donald Trump cult loving behaviors of McDonald's audience to memes and messages that trickle down from billionaires. Just like the Middle Ages Church in Europe trickled-down Bible verses to the population to manipulate the audience meaning of "love", clergy rule, wealth televangelism today of Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump status symbols. ===:::

I once had men slow down and follow me in a creeper van, keeping pace with me, on an unpopulated stretch of road. It was terrifying. They were going so slowly that my jogging pace was faster than them, but I didn't want to put my back to them so I ended up at this awkward shuffle.

We came to a stretch of road where there was a weird three-way intersection. A car came up at the intersection where I needed to cross so I paused, thinking that the creeper van would drive on. Nope. They stopped to keep staring at me. This whole encounter was "only" like thirty seconds, but it felt like a lifetime."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I am not agreeing with this short-thinking Twitter-length statement. But I do ponder that South Park was beyond subscription paywalls and now people who have heard all the hype about the first two episodes that already aired are rewatching the massive collection of previous episodes. Maybe even some of the video games have increased in sales? Fantasy on my part: If South Park could do an episode on 1985 Neil Postman book and how it relates to Surkov and Putin's first 12 years rise to power (1999 to 2011, throw in Robert Reich on economics of the USA Holiday Christmas year-end impact upon Q1 2026... focus on those 3 topics... the war could dramatically turn around. ===:::

It's not that he's a pedophile and very likely trafficked and raped children with Epstein and Maxwell.

It's that apparently there are people who feel like they cannot or WILL NOT remove him from office because of any of these things due to their personal political profit.

He is the actual worst possible human we could have in political power and the people who think he's perfect for the role are the ones who are screwing everyone over - especially themselves."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The issue is not if Putin has blackmail on one person, Donald Trump or even his family. Why do so many people SUPPORT his pro-Russia stance. Only explanation is [Surkov isn't joking about manipulating minds](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-president-vladimir-putin-election-americans-1327793). As I try to correct people on social media: bribes and paying people off is not the deepest motivation. Fox News does not pay their audience to believe fiction. Saudi Arabia does not pay Quran believers to admire Mecca, it is in fact, the other way around. Fox News is paid for by the audience subscriptions (cable TV,etc.) and by advertisers selling products to Fox News audience. Addiction to fiction storytelling is a force that for many people runs far deeper than money motivation and financial incentives. Science fiction of Torah, Quran, Bible have people funding and pay for Mosque / Church / etc. Putin is not bribing millions upon millions of people in USA t be glued to every antic and golf course outing of Donald Trump as a media event. Media addiction to the Trump brand and fantasy lifestyle is a cult type behavior, like people's favorite music band in live concerts on a bigger scale.
