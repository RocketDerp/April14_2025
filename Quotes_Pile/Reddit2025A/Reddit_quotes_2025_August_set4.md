"I’d bet you can find Fox News material from when Obama was president claiming he did or wanted to do many of the things Trump is doing now."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And those years of Fox News messaging (Obama coming on to world stage, campaigh for POTUS 2007 onward), content, were put inside the minds of Fox News audience. Then in March 2013, Russia (working with Cambridge Analytica) mastered the Internet messaging techniques of filliping values in the human mind. Inverting and framing things as us. vs. them... USA vs. USA, not USA vs. Russia. ["At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation." - September 9, 2014 (more than a decade ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/) ===:::

"What the actual fuck. I've been trying to reserve my outrage at all of the daily horrendous shit this admin pulls, but when the administration says "there is no limit to the authority of the President" that's just some of the fucking most traitorous un-American shit I've ever heard.

Not to be some Gadsen-flag-flying cockwomble, but America's government is supposed to be limited in very specific and sometimes vague ways. The authority of any one branch is government is supposed to be limited by the other two branches on a regular basis. The authority of the government is supposed to be limited very specifically to protect people's civil rights. Even the most conservative, elitist, racist, sexist men from the founding wanted a rule of law and guaranteed fair trials, limited arresting power to terrorize citizens, and a presumptuin of innocence.

Obviously execution of those and excuses for why blacks and women (& others) haven't been considered "citizens" consistently has been key in the struggle, but they are just saying wrong, traitorous shit right now."

"It was not the "Lolita Express." That plane was destroyed.

It was another plane that Epstein used to own. It was auctioned off and was purchased by a plane chartering company. Trump's plane, while on the campaign trail, had to get grounded for a week or something. His campaign reached out to a private chartering company to rent a plane. That plane happened to be one of Epstein's planes that was auctioned off and purchased by the chartering company."

He's saying that children of democrats, and even children that could grow up to be a Democrat deserve to be raped.

"This really gets to the heart of our problem as a country. 30+ years of talk radio, fox news, and social media hatemongering has made a part of the country view their own countrymen as sub-human enemies.

Central American concentration camps dont matter, rape doesnt matter, killing democracy doesnt matter... because its just 'democrats'. They arent "Americans I disagree with" or even "Human beings that deserve basic decency" . They are enemies, who deserve every evil that can be inflicted upon them.

Republicans have gotten so tribal and so hate filled that there is no bottom. There is no voice left that says "We are better than this. This behavior is beneath us". And now Foxs News Grandpa is in charge... the unrestricted hateful id of millions of frightened and angry people who have never set foot in America's cities are champing at the bit to wipe them out to save a version of America that exists only in their minds.

Meanwhile, the billionaires who set this all up have to be rolling on the floor laughing that they found so willing an army to keep them safe from anything that might actually make regular American lives better.

"I’m seeing this a lot in any kind of right wing communities. Incels, maga, conservatives all seem to have one thing in common - they cannot see anything that happens to them as their fault. Literally nothing could be caused by them being pieces of shit or having no empathy for others.

It’s democrats faults everything is bad, it’s women’s fault they won’t date you, it’s the evil liberals getting you fired from your job.

Couldn’t be that you’re an evil, selfish pile of shit and people tend to be pushed away from that"

***I would be better copying and pasting quotes from two dozen books than use my own brain damaged frustarted writing. But I can't do either. And I'm so sick of people falling into out-group hate patterns at the hands of Cambridge Analytica and Surkov Kremlin style informaiton warfare.***

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Rupert Murdoch Fox News talking points: you are self-responsible and pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. A corrupt society causes climate change and you stress about your children's future... you are weak-minded. "It’s democrats faults everything is bad" - except it is actually Putin and Donald Trump's fault for being role models that truth, nonfiction, and sincerity are trashed in the USA in year 2025. Same goes for Palestine terrorism and Israel overkill lack of compassion, the clergy doesn't adopt Malala from Pakistan reformations from October 8, 2013 book she published. Marketing, advertising, manipulation is used to make understanding and compression based on emotional manipulation of everyday people. All this "logic" in this Reddit message is exactly the kid of shit that Donald Trump White House would imply liberals do by not being MAGA supporters, hard working obedient people.  It avoids a grater forest for trees perspective of humanity. That love and compassion and understanding needs to be expanded all across the world, it isn't a dog eat dog cut-throat competitive species that wrecks other species in lack of working together sincerely and being honest. Anti-empathy and anti-compassion values of competition. "caused by them being pieces of shit or having no empathy for others" exactly like this very Reddit message, which is not about offering education and teaching (such as informing history of Russian information warfare against USA, history of comparative mythology and how Levant religions are backwards in thinking goodness comes from outer-space aliens who beam down rescue messages), but out-group insulting and mocking. Which are MEGA supremacy values. "I’m seeing this a lot in any kind of right wing communities." in the Reddit message... I'm seeing a lot of the problem described in Amusing Ourselves To Death book from year 1985 authored by Neil Postman. People with faith in left-wing vs. right-wing who won't abandoned the simplistic thinking that is drilled into them by parents that all is left vs. right and view things as Carl Sagan does, fiction vs. non-fiction science. Instead of reading my brain-damaged writing on all these topics, I suggest reading Neil Postman and Carl Sagan and Malala from Pakistan and others and not just engaging in the out-group hate patterns of Russian information warfare that started in March 3013 on social media networks. "it’s the evil liberals getting you fired from your job" - so if you are mind-fucked by Rupert Murdoch Fox News and Russian information warfare... and you say incorrect things and someone calls the police and the police shoot you out... you can't blame the police for being gun-happy ... because it is your fault that billionaires at the Kremlin and billionaires of Rupert Murdoch are better at fucking over your brain ... a predatory nation that turns police officers against everyday people is always the fault of MAGA supporters. Maybe the best editor in the world could explain my point that has been made by others about the Middle Ages Church fucking over the population and how that attitude relates to this Reddit message claim that blaming A vs. B at the low level doesn't see the entire education system of the clergy has fucked over both A and B who don't recognize it until Martin Luther in Germany on Halloween over 500 years ago spills the inside beans on many of the corrupt education practices of the Clergy. So frustrating that we can't work together on this common problem - and better writers without brain damage can't address the out-group hate on Reddit messages like this that I witness every hour of every day.  ===::::

I woke up in the middle of the night and I already know that everythng I have ever written in my life has failed and that nobody in all the public library has been able to convince humanity that the problems of over 8 billion people are common and to stop viewing and addressing this tree after tree and start looking at the common cause forest level. Nation vs. Nation, poltical party vs. political party, religion vs. reigion. Shallow understanding vs. superficial comprehension. 

Malala being ignored by social media users since year 0213, people who are articulate, good communicators (Malala) are avoided. Same with Neil Postman's 1985, 1992 1995 books. They ar not perfect, but they aren't what USA society has become of hate upon MAGA and hate upon Donald Trump where nobdy wants to address the fundamental faith in hate itself making the future better, which it does not. That hate corrupts thining that people can't even see their avoidance of Neil Postman's books, Carl Sagan's books, Malala's global reformation of gender and religions. Here I already again minding my language and brain damage not communicating well enough.

"There is something wrong with our world, something fundamentally and basically wrong. I don't think we have to look too far to see that. I'm sure that most of you would agree with me in making that assertion. And when we stop to analyze the cause of our world's ills, many things come to mind. We begin to wonder if it is due to the fact that we don't know enough. But it can't be that. Because in terms of accumulated knowledge we know more today than men have known in any period of human history. We have the facts at our disposal. We know more about mathematics, about science, about social science, and philosophy than we've ever known in any period of the world's history. So it can't be because we don't know enough. And then we wonder if it is due to the fact that our scientific genius lags behind. That is, if we have not made enough progress scientifically. Well then, it can't be that. For our scientific progress over the past years has been amazing. Man through his scientific genius has been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains, so that today it's possible to eat breakfast in New York City and supper in London, England. Back in about 1753 it took a letter three days to go from New York City to Washington, and today you can go from here to China in less time than that. It can't be because man is stagnant in his scientific progress. Man's scientific genius has been amazing. I think we have to look much deeper than that if we are to find the real cause of man's problems and the real cause of the world's ills today. If we are to really find it I think we will have to look in the hearts and souls of men." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Those words don't even convey it, as they are many decades old and the situation with Donald Trump and Putin is far worse, dialog and communications in society in USA is far worse and more corrupted by Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency aftermath. Everyone is brain damage, the mass man / mass mind of society is corrupted that nobody can cite Peter P and Surkov on Russian techniques and what they ahve done t brian-damage all of Russian society. I can sitll remember what it is like in year 2012 USA and it was nothig like the mental thinking communications language horror show that it is nn year 2025 under Donald Trump. We are living in self-harm to everyone in USA. It runs far deeper than politics, the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica has turned EVERY topic of everything into reactionary grinding of person vs. person wit complex understanding between people to shit. Humanity in total is in a race to the bottom, and the USA is the worst mindsets it has been. We have so many great authors and teachers but peopele want to read shit original writing again and againon media machines and not dust off the best of long-tern perspectives and ...

Of course I can't write this. Even MLK Jr's words aren't good enough to describe how bad it is right now that Donald Trump communications and thinking is every day overy hour of society, not just government, not just election days.

You rarely see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism by emphasizing that **the behavior is actually "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination"** to better describe how predators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of society), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the meaning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "[A Subaru Car is love](https://www.motor1.com/news/142732/subaru-love-ad-campaign/)" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values.

"Unfortunately, his definition of "good" and ours differ greatly, as does his definition of what he's actually accomplished. Felon47 has bragged about stopping multiple wars this term and thinks he handled Covid with a flourish. He views his immigration policy as a good thing - because he's a white supremacist.

He's doing 'good' shit for his ultra wealthy pedo buddies and doesn't understand why the peasantry isn't falling to their knees to blow him for it."

These people are so stupid, so idiotic, so immoral, and that’s ok to them because they’re still immature fifth graders who never learned critical thinking, being empathetic, or learned at all and therefore cannot acknowledge when they’re wrong and will die (see: Covid) to prove they’re right even when intellectualism, facts, science, etc, or even one brain cell proves them wrong.

Whether it be civil rights, immigrants, or people telling them they have to change to protect the environment.

"The issue is not that Donald Trump is dumb.

It's not that he is so woefully unqualified for any job that doesn't involve shitting himself in public.

It's not that he's a 34x convicted felon, rapist, and clearly is mentioned in every page of the Epstein files and coverup.

It's not that he's a pedophile and very likely trafficked and raped children with Epstein and Maxwell.

It's that apparently there are people who feel like they cannot or WILL NOT remove him from office because of any of these things due to their personal political profit.

He is the actual worst possible human we could have in political power and the people who think he's perfect for the role are the ones who are screwing everyone over - especially themselves."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The issue is not if Putin has blackmail on one person, Donald Trump or even his family. Why do so many people SUPPORT his pro-Russia stance. Only explanation is [Surkov isn't joking about manipulating minds](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-president-vladimir-putin-election-americans-1327793). As I try to correct people on social media: bribes and paying people off is not the deepest motivation. Fox News does not pay their audience to believe fiction. Saudi Arabia does not pay Quran believers to admire Mecca, it is in fact, the other way around. Fox News is paid for by the audience subscriptions (cable TV,etc.) and by advertisers selling products to Fox News audience. Addiction to fiction storytelling is a force that for many people runs far deeper than money motivation and financial incentives. Science fiction of Torah, Quran, Bible have people funding and pay for Mosque / Church / etc. Putin is not bribing millions upon millions of people in USA t be glued to every antic and golf course outing of Donald Trump as a media event. Media addiction to the Trump brand and fantasy lifestyle is a cult type behavior, like people's favorite music band in live concerts on a bigger scale.
