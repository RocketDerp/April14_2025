"She made a Tumblr post where she describes falling in love with a 14 year old boy she saw at a fair and wished he was alone since he was with his mom"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social machine consumers of 2025 (chanting "Epstein", "Epstein" constantly in August 2025) in their race to be terse, short-messages popularity (like Twitter / Bluesky / SMS), don't even epseak up that "Falling in love" with an age 14 child that you see in passing at a public event for only minutes is not love at all. You don't see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism of saying "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination" to better describe how predoators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of societ), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the maning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "A Subura Car is love" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values. Donald Trump knows exactly what he is doing with his lifetime assocation with McDonald's marketing / logo / brands / slogans. Donald Trump cult loving behaviors of McDonald's audience to memes and messages that trickle down from billionaires. ===:::
