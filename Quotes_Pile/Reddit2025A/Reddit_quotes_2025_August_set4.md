"She made a Tumblr post where she describes falling in love with a 14 year old boy she saw at a fair and wished he was alone since he was with his mom"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social machine consumers of 2025 (chanting "Epstein", "Epstein" constantly in August 2025) in their race to be terse, short-messages popularity (like Twitter / Bluesky / SMS), don't even speak up that *"falling in love"* with an age 14 child that you see in passing at a public event for only minutes is not *love* at all. You rarely see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism by emphasizing that **the behavior is actually "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination"** to better describe how predators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of society), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the meaning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "[A Subaru Car is love](https://www.motor1.com/news/142732/subaru-love-ad-campaign/)" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values. Donald Trump knows exactly what he is doing with his lifetime association with McDonald's marketing / logo / brands / slogans. Donald Trump cult loving behaviors of McDonald's audience to memes and messages that trickle down from billionaires. Just like the Middle Ages Church in Europe trickled-down Bible verses to the population to manipualte the audience menaing of "love", clergy rule, wealth televagelism today of Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump status symbols. ===:::

"Worth noting that Kyle A Carroza also started a multi-year harrassment campaign against one of the disabled artists that worked for him.

Because they drew Fosters Home of imaginary Friends and invader zim porn. He also sexually harrassed this person prior to this campaign and when they tried to speak out he got her blacklisted from the industry. She lost their healthcare and went into hospice care a couple years ago.

No one who helped or defended Kyle at the time has since apologized."

"And it's the reason decent guys think women are "bitches". I am an outgoing, friendly person. Just accidentally making eye contact (literally not even realizing it) has had men follow me ONE HOUR to my house. Ignoring men's catcalls has led to a HOST of insults/verbal abuse "not even that hot!", "probably a fucking lezzie", etc. It made me NOT be nice to any men because they took everything as hitting on them.

You know when men think women are hitting on them because they have a wedding ring? I am pretty sure women just think it's not safe to talk to them because they wont fucking stalk or assault them for not accepting their advances.

When I became old enough (about 55) to not be attractive to men, I could be myself without fear.

Terrible men make it harder for everyone."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Why are girls not standing up for women in Iran and Pakistan and Afghanistan and Russia and not just viewing this as USA / UK issue? Why not compare Donald Trump to the Taliban? [Why aren't women on social media (and men) joining (reposting, ReTweeting constantly with spare time that social media users use for commenting) a world-wide women/girls movement established by Malala in year 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjGL6YY6oMs)? Why is that (this Reddit posting) is only in reaction to men and police and Donald Trump and people can't hear Malala calling out to the entire Pale Blue Dot to rally behind her movement for girls / women in the most female-abused parts of the world? Because the *better off world* doesn't want to face that it is a global problem of the human brain, education / teaching, our minds. It isn't a issue in only one nation that female are subjugated and sold for money. We don't teach love, we market and advertise lust, McDonald's I'm Loving it consumption morality lessons from billionaires.

"You think being gay has ever stopped a creep from being a creep?

Comments like this really shows how misinformed people are still about sexual harassment and misogyny. People like this don’t harass women because they like them. They do it because they hate them."
