"She made a Tumblr post where she describes falling in love with a 14 year old boy she saw at a fair and wished he was alone since he was with his mom"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social machine consumers of 2025 (chanting "Epstein", "Epstein" constantly in August 2025) in their race to be terse, short-messages popularity (like Twitter / Bluesky / SMS), don't even speak up that *"falling in love"* with an age 14 child that you see in passing at a public event for only minutes is not *love* at all. You rarely see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism by emphasizing that **the behavior is actually "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination"** to better describe how predators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of society), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the meaning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "[A Subaru Car is love](https://www.motor1.com/news/142732/subaru-love-ad-campaign/)" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values. Donald Trump knows exactly what he is doing with his lifetime association with McDonald's marketing / logo / brands / slogans. Donald Trump cult loving behaviors of McDonald's audience to memes and messages that trickle down from billionaires. Just like the Middle Ages Church in Europe trickled-down Bible verses to the population to manipulate the audience meaning of "love", clergy rule, wealth televangelism today of Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump status symbols. ===:::

"Worth noting that Kyle A Carroza also started a multi-year harrassment campaign against one of the disabled artists that worked for him.

Because they drew Fosters Home of imaginary Friends and invader zim porn. He also sexually harrassed this person prior to this campaign and when they tried to speak out he got her blacklisted from the industry. She lost their healthcare and went into hospice care a couple years ago.

"And it's the reason decent guys think women are "bitches". I am an outgoing, friendly person. Just accidentally making eye contact (literally not even realizing it) has had men follow me ONE HOUR to my house. Ignoring men's catcalls has led to a HOST of insults/verbal abuse "not even that hot!", "probably a fucking lezzie", etc. It made me NOT be nice to any men because they took everything as hitting on them.

You know when men think women are hitting on them because they have a wedding ring? I am pretty sure women just think it's not safe to talk to them because they wont fucking stalk or assault them for not accepting their advances.

When I became old enough (about 55) to not be attractive to men, I could be myself without fear.

"Right, it's not about the attractiveness. It's about the power dynamic where the men feel good about making the women uncomfortable. Even "ugly" women are raped. Women in head-to-toe coverings are raped. Elderly women are raped.

I once had men slow down and follow me in a creeper van, keeping pace with me, on an unpopulated stretch of road. It was terrifying. They were going so slowly that my jogging pace was faster than them, but I didn't want to put my back to them so I ended up at this awkward shuffle.

We came to a stretch of road where there was a weird three-way intersection. A car came up at the intersection where I needed to cross so I paused, thinking that the creeper van would drive on. Nope. They stopped to keep staring at me. This whole encounter was "only" like thirty seconds, but it felt like a lifetime."

"A lot of men in the comments are very, very upset to be reminded that women don’t exist in public exclusively for their pleasure and because you refuse to exercise self-control, women need draconian measures like cat call police units in the UK and women only train cars in Japan to have some semblance of safety when they want to leave the house.

Every comment about how hot the police women are, or how men aren’t allowed to talk to women anymore, huh, is yet another example of why for these measures are welcomed by women. Think it’s Orwellian? Then shut the fuck up. Here, in the streets, everywhere—shut the fuck up and mind your business.
