"We’ve also cut federal funding across multiple areas such as medical research, technology, renewable energies, etc.

This on top of refusing partnerships with our allies will have a devastating effect on our country that won’t rear its head until it’s too late. We’ll continue to fall further back in an industries until not only are we not a superpower, but barely a relevant country at all.

At least our insatiable consumerism will keep us relevant"

"You’re so right. I had so much family in the Midwest asking me about crime in Portland and Seattle when I was living in the PNW. It was no different than any other city.

And they were all people who will never leave the Midwest for travel or otherwise, be it due to financial concerns, fear, or “why would I travel when everything I need is right here?”

They assume all of these cities in blue states are on fire and crumbling because they lack curiosity and constantly absorb news media that lies to them and wants them to live in fear."

"Fox news needs to be punished for what they did to this country. Just on the issue of covid, they encouraged an apathetic response to their viewers knowing fully their actions would get people killed. The estimated unnecessary deaths the apathetic response directly caused is estimated at close to 100 thousand Americans when we look at other countries death counts versus ours factoring for population, wealth, and hospital capacity. We had 20 percent of the deaths and only 4 percent of the global population. This is an extreme outlier that can ONLY be explained through the murderous and widespread propaganda that was unique in the US.

This is 100 percent on fox news. Now we look at the mass psychosis responsible for our fall to fascism. Again, fox news."

Fiction news and fiction addiction is core to USA problems. Peopole are not organizing around leaders on these extremely serious topics. Billionares have mastered the production values of large-scale popularity and desire people crossing paths on social media conversations, groups of people are not sustaining the most important topics.

"I said when biden took office no way he is as stupid as obama was. well turns out he was dumber than fuck too. both these idiots are failed leaders who should absolutely not be looked at as great people because both of them are responsible for maga and neither takes any responsibility. Idc if they did some good it was not enough compared to their countless mistakes and needless mistakes that led us here. Not to mention they intentionally did awful shit like bailed out wall street which indirectly led us here as well."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit comment message: "responsible for maga and neither takes any responsibility" - yha, Internet Research Agency attacking multiple NATO nations isn't responsible, a new tyle of information warfare devised by Cambridge Analytica and Kremlin are not responsible. Fox News is not responsible. Donald Trump is not responsible. But Obama is responsible. "if they did some good it was not enough" - so the war aganinst abortion, women, domination of women... is Malala from Swat Valley not *good enough* to support? This Reddit message wants to blame 8 billion world problem on not THE PEOPLE on social media who use Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Bluesky - but blame it on the leaders who follow the people's choices. Why aren't you choosing to support Malala from Pakistan and promote her ideas, "if they did some good it was not enough". What do people expect from ONE PERSON. Obama and Biden are just ONE PERSOn. Without the support of We The People staying focused. Same with the Second Bill of Rights - Michael Moore has brought it up, Bernie Sanders has brought it up, but all social media wants to bring up and keep repeating is "Luigi" murder in Manhattan of a CEO - which does not address all the issues in the Second Bill of Rights - and really is gun worship gun stroking USA attraction to dramatic shootings. Why can't social media users call for people, We The People, to be serious and sustained on important topics? The *brainrot* problem is widespread and we aren't addressing it head on. The brain damage from IRA and CA are widespread and we aren't taking it on... the Fox News problem is widespread and we aren't taking it on. Leaders of the nation REPRESENT The People, We The People, and we need to address our addiciton to fiction politicians and fiction social media content. "I said when biden took office no way he is as stupid as obama was. well turns out he was dumber than fuck too. both these idiots" ... Obama is not stupid or idiot, the problem is the audience, the voters, what Neil Postman describes in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" where people accept statements like "I said when biden took office no way he is as stupid as obama was. well turns out he was dumber than fuck too. both these idiots" without providing ANY specific citations, authors, articles to back up their claim that *the others* are idiots. That's exactly how MAGA talks about Obama and Biden... that they are idiots an dumb without being able to articulate and discuss any specifics. Everything I say is repeating and repeating, because [the quality writing such as this March 2024 article doesn't get the point across (does not gain popularity)](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/) that people are not recognizing and articulating the behavior of this insult mockery communications style that saturates thinking. ===:::

"Our country is falling apart, and it's entirely because Trump is in power. Those who voted for him, and those who refused to back Harris in the last election, are the reason we may never have a legitimate election again."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Donald Trump is a force of nonstop media engagement, content creation. Now generative artificial intelligence can produce this same kind of engaging shock content and fiction. We need to address We The People addiciton to fiction - Donald Trump White House is driven by fiction, MAGA is driven by fiction, Fox News is fiction, Newsmax is fiction. Sports style rectangle "in the box" reactionary predictable thinking. Real Life is not a rectangle sports field with seating around it. It's simulacra and we are self-exploiting our own minds by framing everything the with fiction the way Kremmlin / Trump / MAGA / Fox News / Newsmax / etc does. "Our country is falling apart" - We The People's attraction to sincere nonfiction leadership and content has fallen apart. ===:::

"It doesn't matter that the Democrats weren't perfect. We were facing the inhalation of our country and far too many people demanded Harris be perfect otherwise they would choose to end the United States. Now look at where we are. The fucking military is occupying US cities. People are dying in concentration camps.

Anyone who attacked Harris or didn't vote for her is to blame for this disaster."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And what about all the members of Congress who can impeach Donald Trump and represent The People? All this fixation on concentrating all attention and focus on one single person - POTUS Donald Trump. What about tall the voting for nonfiction and superficial content all over every social media platform / entertainment media platforms? The anti-comprehension problems, all the things Neil Postman describes in his critiism of SOCIETY WIDE behaviors in 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", and how people aren't standing up for learning and teaching of adults - which is what Fox News does.

"Ok so why isn’t the entire Democratic Party acting like it? Why is California seemingly the only state willing to fight back? Why was the Democratic Party so lazy and naive in understanding what they’re up against?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Where is California fighting back. Oh, this person doesn't mean the Democratic Paty, they mean only established leaders, not We The People. Why isn't Reddit making Jen Senko's March 2016 film front page if Fox News is such a problem? Why isn't Reddit shutting down entertainment instead of just promoting guilitines and murder with guns and weapons? Because people do not want to face up that Apple iPhone / Samsung Android / Apple iPad and addiction to reactionary MAGA media systems is core to the IRA and Cambridge Analytica information warfare. "the Democratic Party so lazy and naive in understanding" and MAGA is not naive? And again, are you fixated in 100 leaders or hundreds of millions of American population? What about the population of Twitter, TikTok, Fox News, Reddit, Facebook, social media? Detachment from reality isn't the same as being "naive", being addicted to mockery screen games on social machines insulting a few people and not recognizing that democracy is We The People brinrot in August 2025. "the entire Democratic Party" === 100 million people or you still mean only 100 or 250 representative people? Fixated on figureheads and not bottom-up intelligence and comprehension. Yes, i am repeating and repeating and repeat and repeat and repeat, because the problem is not just Donald Trump who can't resist Kremlin information warfare since March 2013, it is the entire population, 100% of USA, not just MAGA, not just Republicans, EVERYONE, even those too young to vote / nonvoters etc.  The problems Neil Postman describes in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and the [Kremlin war against Reality are impacting EVERYONE](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/) and even people in other NATO nations (and even Japan, outside NATO is reporting Russian war against reality). ===:::

"Look at how gerrymandered Illinois is and the northeast of the US. Is that a threat to democracy too?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Democracy does not work if you do not love one another. If you do not love your neighbor, democracy does not work. There is a unwritten implicaiton in The Constittuion that people wifully choose to love one another, share, and treat each other with authentic goodness. Nazi Germany was a democracy where love was abandoned, Nazi Germany abnadoned goodness. Democracy will create Hell if the only measure and desire is to focus on popularity and numbers and act like compassion and love don't matter. If murder is trending on social media, killing encouraged, chasing the popularity with media systems will create Hell. A democracy that creates Hell is unacceptable. People are acting as if information warfare from Cambridge Analytica and the Russian IRA doesn't matter - despite seeing evidence all around then that *hate motivated politics* is consuming the USA since March 2013 when the IRA went online. **If you adopt hate as popularity, democracy will create Hell**. It is unwritten rule that needs to be educated: hate and Hell are not acceptable. Fiction govenring is not acceptable. Sincere honest loving compassionate government has to be a desire and function of democracy. [Love and compassion are not optional in society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIe7N3zH5eU). ===:::

Free Speech doesn't mean make shit up and pass it off as real. It SHOULD NEVER protect misinformation and lies. The penalties for misleading the American populace, especially as it pertains to political information should be so steep that nobody would ever want to do so.

The First Amendment was put into place to allow people to speak truth to power and openly talk about grievances they have with the Government, without fears of the Government destroying their lives. That was it.

The early US had some SHARP laws about Chartered Corporations attempting to influence public opinion. It was an immediate corporate death sentence. It was absolutely forbidden. Almost immediately, those with money worked to eliminate that.

The idea that Free Speech must be absolute is one of the most damaging and destructive ideas to our nation, than anything else."

Not to be some Gadsen-flag-flying cockwomble, but America's government is supposed to be limited in very specific and sometimes vague ways. The authority of any one branch is government is supposed to be limited by the other two branches on a regular basis. The authority of the government is supposed to be limited very specifically to protect people's civil rights. Even the most conservative, elitist, racist, sexist men from the founding wanted a rule of law and guaranteed fair trials, limited arresting power to terrorize citizens, and a presumptuin of innocence.

Obviously execution of those and excuses for why blacks and women (& others) haven't been considered "citizens" consistently has been key in the struggle, but they are just saying wrong, traitorous shit right now."

It was another plane that Epstein used to own. It was auctioned off and was purchased by a plane chartering company.

They arent "Americans I disagree with" or even "Human beings that deserve basic decency" . They are enemies, who deserve every evil that can be inflicted upon them.

And now Foxs News Grandpa is in charge... the unrestricted hateful id of millions of frightened and angry people who have never set foot in America's cities are champing at the bit to wipe them out to save a version of America that exists only in their minds.

"Trump is high off his own supply of BS."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length simple thinking, Bluesky length. Donald Trump is high, just as his audeience on Reddit is, with Kremlin fiction. Since March 2013. Surkov won. Being reactionary, shallow, superficial, attracted to mockery and insulting is a symptom of this "high" and the Surovian student "supply". ===:::

"Trump supporters are laughing at this story

That really says a lot about this whole situation"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Humor brain exploits are common. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about detachment from nonfiction. ===:::

&nbsp;

"I’m seeing this a lot in any kind of right wing communities. Incels, maga, conservatives all seem to have one thing in common - they cannot see anything that happens to them as their fault. Literally nothing could be caused by them being pieces of shit or having no empathy for others.

It’s democrats faults everything is bad, it’s women’s fault they won’t date you, it’s the evil liberals getting you fired from your job.

Couldn’t be that you’re an evil, selfish pile of shit and people tend to be pushed away from that"

.

.

***I would be better copying and pasting quotes from two dozen books than use my own brain damaged frustarted writing. But I can't do either. And I'm so sick of people falling into out-group hate patterns at the hands of Cambridge Analytica and Surkov Kremlin style information warfare.***

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Rupert Murdoch Fox News talking points: you are self-responsible and pick yourself up by your own bootstraps. A corrupt society causes climate change and you stress about your children's future... you are weak-minded. "It’s democrats faults everything is bad" - except it is actually Putin and Donald Trump's fault for being role models that truth, nonfiction, and sincerity are trashed in the USA in year 2025. Same goes for Palestine terrorism and Israel overkill lack of compassion, the clergy doesn't adopt Malala from Pakistan reformations from October 8, 2013 book she published. Marketing, advertising, manipulation is used to make understanding and compression based on emotional manipulation of everyday people. All this "logic" in this Reddit message is exactly the kid of shit that Donald Trump White House would imply liberals do by not being MAGA supporters, hard working obedient people.  It avoids a grater forest for trees perspective of humanity. That love and compassion and understanding needs to be expanded all across the world, it isn't a dog eat dog cut-throat competitive species that wrecks other species in lack of working together sincerely and being honest. Anti-empathy and anti-compassion values of competition. "caused by them being pieces of shit or having no empathy for others" exactly like this very Reddit message, which is not about offering education and teaching (such as informing history of Russian information warfare against USA, history of comparative mythology and how Levant religions are backwards in thinking goodness comes from outer-space aliens who beam down rescue messages), but out-group insulting and mocking. Which are MEGA supremacy values. "I’m seeing this a lot in any kind of right wing communities." in the Reddit message... I'm seeing a lot of the problem described in Amusing Ourselves To Death book from year 1985 authored by Neil Postman. People with faith in left-wing vs. right-wing who won't abandoned the simplistic thinking that is drilled into them by parents that all is left vs. right and view things as Carl Sagan does, fiction vs. non-fiction science. Instead of reading my brain-damaged writing on all these topics, I suggest reading Neil Postman and Carl Sagan and Malala from Pakistan and others and not just engaging in the out-group hate patterns of Russian information warfare that started in March 3013 on social media networks. "it’s the evil liberals getting you fired from your job" - so if you are mind-fucked by Rupert Murdoch Fox News and Russian information warfare... and you say incorrect things and someone calls the police and the police shoot you out... you can't blame the police for being gun-happy ... because it is your fault that billionaires at the Kremlin and billionaires of Rupert Murdoch are better at fucking over your brain ... a predatory nation that turns police officers against everyday people is always the fault of MAGA supporters. Maybe the best editor in the world could explain my point that has been made by others about the Middle Ages Church fucking over the population and how that attitude relates to this Reddit message claim that blaming A vs. B at the low level doesn't see the entire education system of the clergy has fucked over both A and B who don't recognize it until Martin Luther in Germany on Halloween over 500 years ago spills the inside beans on many of the corrupt education practices of the Clergy. So frustrating that we can't work together on this common problem - and better writers without brain damage can't address the out-group hate on Reddit messages like this that I witness every hour of every day.  ===::::

I woke up in the middle of the night and I already know that everythng I have ever written in my life has failed and that nobody in all the public library has been able to convince humanity that the problems of over 8 billion people are common and to stop viewing and addressing this tree after tree and start looking at the common cause forest level. Nation vs. Nation, political party vs. political party, religion vs. reigion. Shallow understanding vs. superficial comprehension. 

Malala being ignored by social media users since year 0213, people who are articulate, good communicators (Malala) are avoided. Same with Neil Postman's 1985, 1992 1995 books. They ar not perfect, but they aren't what USA society has become of hate upon MAGA and hate upon Donald Trump where nobdy wants to address the fundamental faith in hate itself making the future better, which it does not. That hate corrupts thinking that people can't even see their avoidance of Neil Postman's books, Carl Sagan's books, Malala's global reformation of gender and religions. Here I already again minding my language and brain damage not communicating well enough.

"There is something wrong with our world, something fundamentally and basically wrong. I don't think we have to look too far to see that. I'm sure that most of you would agree with me in making that assertion. And when we stop to analyze the cause of our world's ills, many things come to mind. We begin to wonder if it is due to the fact that we don't know enough. But it can't be that. Because in terms of accumulated knowledge we know more today than men have known in any period of human history. We have the facts at our disposal. We know more about mathematics, about science, about social science, and philosophy than we've ever known in any period of the world's history. So it can't be because we don't know enough. And then we wonder if it is due to the fact that our scientific genius lags behind. That is, if we have not made enough progress scientifically. Well then, it can't be that. For our scientific progress over the past years has been amazing. Man through his scientific genius has been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains, so that today it's possible to eat breakfast in New York City and supper in London, England. Back in about 1753 it took a letter three days to go from New York City to Washington, and today you can go from here to China in less time than that. It can't be because man is stagnant in his scientific progress. Man's scientific genius has been amazing. I think we have to look much deeper than that if we are to find the real cause of man's problems and the real cause of the world's ills today. If we are to really find it I think we will have to look in the hearts and souls of men." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Those words don't even convey it, as they are many decades old and the situation with Donald Trump and Putin is far worse, dialog and communications in society in USA is far worse and more corrupted by Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency aftermath. Everyone is brain damage, the mass man / mass mind of society is corrupted that nobody can cite Peter P and Surkov on Russian techniques and what they have done t brian-damage all of Russian society. I can still remember what it is like in year 2012 USA and it was nothing like the mental thinking communications language horror show that it is nn year 2025 under Donald Trump. We are living in self-harm to everyone in USA. It runs far deeper than politics, the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica has turned EVERY topic of everything into reactionary grinding of person vs. person wit complex understanding between people to shit. Humanity in total is in a race to the bottom, and the USA is the worst mindsets it has been. We have so many great authors and teachers but peopele want to read shit original writing again and againon media machines and not dust off the best of long-tern perspectives and ...

Of course I can't write this. Even MLK Jr's words aren't good enough to describe how bad it is right now that Donald Trump communications and thinking is every day overy hour of society, not just government, not just election days.

People didn't seirously take on Fox News and Kremlin information warfare. Alternate reality that abandons goodness isn't progress.

You rarely see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism by emphasizing that **the behavior is actually "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination"** to better describe how predators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of society), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the meaning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "[A Subaru Car is love](https://www.motor1.com/news/142732/subaru-love-ad-campaign/)" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values.

"A majority of people have been so damaged and are so broken and Trump is taking advantage of that.

These people are so stupid, so idiotic, so immoral, and that’s ok to them because they’re still immature fifth graders who never learned critical thinking, being empathetic, or learned at all and therefore cannot acknowledge when they’re wrong and will die (see: Covid) to prove they’re right even when intellectualism, facts, science, etc, or even one brain cell proves them wrong.

It’s raging insecurity and fear that drives these people whose brains and minds never progressed to double-digits in age."

This is because they have been given permission to hate. They don’t care about all the other stuff as long as they are allowed to hate the things that make them uncomfortable. Whether it be civil rights, immigrants, or people telling them they have to change to protect the environment. If it inconveniences them they want to be allowed to hate it whether they are in the right or not. They don’t care about the consequences and they are completely willing to ignore any faults if they can do what they want and someone tells them their feelings are justified."

"The issue is not that Donald Trump is dumb.

It's not that he has dementia.

It's not that he clearly doesn't understand anything real.

It's not that he is so woefully unqualified for any job that doesn't involve shitting himself in public.

It's not that he's a 34x convicted felon, rapist, and clearly is mentioned in every page of the Epstein files and coverup.

It's not that he's a pedophile and very likely trafficked and raped children with Epstein and Maxwell.

It's that apparently there are people who feel like they cannot or WILL NOT remove him from office because of any of these things due to their personal political profit.

He is the actual worst possible human we could have in political power and the people who think he's perfect for the role are the ones who are screwing everyone over - especially themselves."

This kind of thinking only makes sense if self-harm of USA is the intention.

"What kind of blackmail material would matter? With what we already know about Trump, what could possibly move the needle, particularly with his base? We’re seeing the Epstein stuff being covered up in plain sight, and that hasn’t caused an exodus."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The issue is not if Putin has blackmail on one person, Donald Trump or even his family. Why do so many people SUPPORT his pro-Russia stance. Only explanation is [Surkov isn't joking about manipulating minds](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-president-vladimir-putin-election-americans-1327793). As I try to correct people on social media: bribes and paying people off is not the deepest motivation. Fox News does not pay their audience to believe fiction. Saudi Arabia does not pay Quran believers to admire Mecca, it is in fact, the other way around. Fox News is paid for by the audience subscriptions (cable TV,etc.) and by advertisers selling products to Fox News audience. Addiction to fiction storytelling is a force that for many people runs far deeper than money motivation and financial incentives. Science fiction of Torah, Quran, Bible have people funding and pay for Mosque / Church / etc. Putin is not bribing millions upon millions of people in USA t be glued to every antic and golf course outing of Donald Trump as a media event. Media addiction to the Trump brand and fantasy lifestyle is a cult type behavior, like people's favorite music band in live concerts on a bigger scale.
