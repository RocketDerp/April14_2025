"She made a Tumblr post where she describes falling in love with a 14 year old boy she saw at a fair and wished he was alone since he was with his mom"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social machine consumers of 2025 (chanting "Epstein", "Epstein" constantly in August 2025) in their race to be terse, short-messages popularity (like Twitter / Bluesky / SMS), don't even speak up that *"falling in love"* with an age 14 child that you see in passing at a public event for only minutes is not *love* at all. You rarely see criticism that such an important word to humanity, "love", is abused this way. Criticism by emphasizing that **the behavior is actually "lust" and "infatuation" and "domination"** to better describe how predators behave towards children. Instead of educating and describing the predatory mindsets (and the marketing and advertising predatory mental programming of society), people just let McDonald's and Subaru corporations hijack the word "love" to mean "object to consume". Which is not the meaning of "love" in any way shape or form, to "love a McDonald's Hamburger" or "[A Subaru Car is love](https://www.motor1.com/news/142732/subaru-love-ad-campaign/)" is a mind-fuck leading to Donald Trump leadership in USA values. Donald Trump knows exactly what he is doing with his lifetime association with McDonald's marketing / logo / brands / slogans. Donald Trump cult loving behaviors of McDonald's audience to memes and messages that trickle down from billionaires. Just like the Middle Ages Church in Europe trickled-down Bible verses to the population to manipualte the audience menaing of "love", clergy rule, wealth televagelism today of Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump status symbols. ===:::

"4chan and Tumblr really are just 2 sides of the same coin

-I say, as a smug redditor (I need to get a life)"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MSNBC vs. Fox News, Facebook vs. book readers, media empire vs. media empoire, Quran vs. Torah, Truth Social media vs. Bible media, Mosque venue vs. Church venue, Reddit vs. 4Chan, Bluesky vs. Twitter, Reddit iPhone app vs. Reddit web app. Everything is Media Ecology. [» All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the message. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. «](https://whtsnxt.net/quotes/all-media-work-us-over-completely-they-are-so-pervasive-in-their-personal-political-economic-aesthetic-psychological-moral-ethical-and-social-consequences-that-they-leave-no-part-of-us-untouch) ===:::
