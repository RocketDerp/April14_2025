# Surkovian Onion Eating

Thinking that this is ONLY the United States of America and Donald Trumpism and having zero ability to describe and associate with Russia year 2012 methods of governing:

1. Peter Pomerantsev [2014: "Menace of Unreality", "Information Warfare"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)
2. Adam Curtis [2014: "Contradictory Vaudeville"](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)
3. Anything written about techniques of media enagement from goverment to people around Vladislav Surkov
4. Cambridge Analytica - [military psycological doctorates, organized manipulation firm](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy) - and that there could possibly be permananent aftermath and side-effects in the general population. Further, [that Russia worked with Cambridge Analytica since November 2012](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/).
5. Pizzagate, QAnon topics - without reference to ["War Against Reality" information warfare topics from **year 2014** Peter Pomerantsev](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). - Also avoiding any of the public notices of **factual evidence* that [QAnon was promoted by Russia since year 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/qanon-russia-conspiracy-theory-trump-2020-election-b1536946.html) - and that [QAnon symbols were promenent at January 6, 2021 insurection](https://time.com/5928627/symbols-capitol/).

&nbsp;

## Common forms:

1. Citing "Project 2025" but not "Plot to break America" 2019, recency bias.  References to Project 2025 without ever mentioning 2019 book (per-pandemic) titled "The Plot To Break America" that has this quote: “In one experiment, CA would show people on online panels pictures of simple bar graphs about uncontroversial things (e.g., the usage rates of mobile phones or sales of a car type) and the majority would be able to read the graph correctly. However, unbeknownst to the respondents, the data behind these graphs had actually been derived from politically controversial topics, such as income inequality, climate change, or deaths from gun violence. When the labels of the same graphs were later switched to their actual controversial topic, respondents who were made angry by identity threats were more likely to misread the relabeled graphs that they had previously understood. What CA observed was that when respondents were angry, their need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led CA to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America
2. This is just distraction. Complete failure to grasp that media engagement, making the Kremlin and White House the center of daily life, a constant topic, is the goal. One media performance of fiction is not a distraction from the main performance of fiction, it is like Disneyland with multiple rides in the same park.
3. Claiming it is classic propaganda and not being able to describe Surkov and Ukraine War since February 2014 has been one of the most successful propaganda events in all human world history in wrecking the USA and getting Donald Trump (serving Putin) to attack NATO, attack Canada, attack allies, etc.
4. Not being able to take serious that professional doctors of psychiatry and psychology worked for Cambridge Analytica and describe Dr. Abraham Brill and Edward Bernays in the 1920's.
5. Not keeping up that Russia information warfare has gone beyond the Internet Research Agency / IRA - and in topics like hurricanes: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/russia-ai-hurricane-milton-disinformation
6. Thinking it is only *paid advertisement with money to follow* when the Internet Research Agency clearly is described as using [*free* upvoting / likes / comments back since year 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/).... which is *validated* by discovery of free commenting messages (not paid advertisement) by [scrunity from George Washington Uniersity and Johns Hopkins University going back to year 2014](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/23/russian-trolls-spread-vaccine-misinformation-on-twitter).
7. Constant *distraction theory*, *shiny object* theory - without being able to cite Neil Postman / Andrew Postman, Peter P that this is entertainment. This isn't distraction, this is engagement (offering channels people can flip back and forth between - media addiction to fiction, avoiding non-fiction reality), Donald Trump is a social media / mainstream media content creator of fiction to wreck reality. This is the War Against Reality center stage, the "distraction" is authentic science reality, nonfiction. Just like Mecca and Quran, it is a religion, people aren't *distracted* by the religion, it is their choice of fiction (religion) over reality. This is a much deeper and more complex problem of humanity going back thousands of years. This is the "old world order" of mythology, not the science perspective of 1776 Great Seal of the United States of American symbolism "new world order".
8. Comments about how nothing makes sense and nobody bothers to discuss Peter P's writings since year 2013, Andrew Postman 2017 / Neil Postman 1985, etc.
9. "Flooding the Zone", "Gish Gallop" references without EVER referencing Surkov / Peter P / Internet Research Agency / Cambridge Analytica / Neil Postman.

### Rendering Resistance *Absurd* with "The Onion" antics   

&nbsp;

"The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd. One moment Surkov would  ..." ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, **year 2014**
