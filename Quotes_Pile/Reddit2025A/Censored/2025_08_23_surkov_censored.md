Of course it does. **Everything Donald Trump does since year 2013 INCREASES ATTENTION to him**.

*We The People* are entirely addicted to Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton act. This is all Surkov screenplay year 2011 applied to White House and multiple antics actors on every social machine system available. Endless mockery and mocking about how terrible Tony Clifton performance is from the audience. Everyone here is eating the Surkov onions and grinning about how great it is to be bamboozled.
