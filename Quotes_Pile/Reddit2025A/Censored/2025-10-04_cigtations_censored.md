> I literally did reply to your pseudo-facts

Which are those? "pseudo-facts" is a thought-terminating cliché. You sound incredibly shallow and superficial, reactionary mindset.

REFERENCE: "A thought-terminating cliche (also known as a semantic stop-sign, a thought-stopper, bumper sticker logic, or cliché thinking) is a form of loaded language"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9

> You're immature.

So you are here to suppress people you consider immature? Anti-equality of thinking about the Founding Fathers of the United States of America?  You think my citation of a 1987 lecture from a doctorate is "immature"?

I think you are using reactionary mindsets. Your mind is reacting and not engaging ideas outside your filter bubble focus.

>  the citation (you added in after the fact

No , I did not. I can prove it with GitHub logs I am making of your messages to me that the citation was part of my messaging here on Reddit about the shallow and superficial behavior people have about USA Founding Fathers.
