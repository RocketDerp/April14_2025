Story to go along with this.

1. I posted the comment message without the final sentence, it was published.

2. I edited the message 30 seconds later and added the final sentence

3. The message was removed from publication / censored.

4. I duplicated the message by changing  "Woke" to "W0ke" with zero, that was published.

Seems the word "Woke" is an automatic message censorship on this subreddit. These removals are silent. I have to use another Internet connection to confirm if the actual comment is published or unpublished after every edit. Reddit servers manipulate the user who creates the comment to see the message as published. You have to check from another connection to Reddit to confirm it wasn't censored.

This kind of censorship is garbage, you waste a whole bunch of time confirming your message isn't secretly censored. You have to go outside the network to confirm it actually is published to other people. And you know other people must be getting their messages pulled without even realizing it.

It's not a unique plot. Futurama "Obsoletely Fabulous" 

Bender resists an upgrade of his mind by society and there is an assembly line of feeding a fiction fantasy story of the upgrade resistance.

23 minutes into episode 1 of Pluribus the James Joyce Finnegans Wake book is dropped on the Public House table. Then whole world ends. Finnegans Wake is about everyone *already being* in a fiction reality of the clergy making and society making, and waking up the whole world to reality itself. **Woke / Wokeness** story.
