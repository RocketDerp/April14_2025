Story to go along with this.

1. I posted the comment message without the final sentence, it was published.

2. I even got 1 upvote on the message, which I can see, 2 points total in including my own self-upvote.

3. I edited the message 3  minutes later and added the final sentence

4. The instant my edit was saved to server, the comment message was removed from publication / censored.

5. I reaalized on this one specific comment which keyword triggered the automatic unpublishing. I duplicated the message (fresh new comment  at root of thread tree) except changing "Woke" to "W0ke" with zero, that was published. Bypassing the unpublish keyword filters.

Seems the word "Woke" is an automatic message censorship on this subreddit. These removals are silent. I have to use another Internet connection to confirm if the actual comment is published or unpublished after every edit. Reddit servers manipulate the user who creates the comment to see the message as published. You have to check from another connection to Reddit to confirm it wasn't censored.

This kind of censorship is garbage, you waste a whole bunch of time confirming your message isn't secretly censored. You have to go outside the network to confirm it actually is published to other people. And you know other people must be getting their messages pulled without even realizing it.

It's not a unique plot. Futurama "Obsoletely Fabulous" 

Bender resists an upgrade of his mind by society and there is an assembly line of feeding a fiction fantasy story of the upgrade resistance.

23 minutes into episode 1 of Pluribus the James Joyce Finnegans Wake book is dropped on the Public House table. Then whole world ends. Finnegans Wake is about everyone *already being* in a fiction reality of the clergy making and society making, and waking up the whole world to reality itself. **Woke / Wokeness** story.
