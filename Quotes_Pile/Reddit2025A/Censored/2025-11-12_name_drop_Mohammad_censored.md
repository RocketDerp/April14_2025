> I've watched this video and several other videos about Finnegan's Wake and I'm still utterly confused. 

Let me tell you what most people don't have the balls to say.

1. Bible, Torah, Quran are fed into children / indoctrination,and people treat them like the are nonfiction. "Believers"

2. There are implications to this. How can books (or stories) be so powerful that people won't accept that they are fiction? Is there a pattern to such stories.

3. On page 581 of FInnegans Wake this pattern is given a name "monomyth".  https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter34/1024finn34.htm

4. the whole "Wake" means "Woke", Wake the fuck up, you believe fiction storytelling is nonfiction. "Young Earth", "intelligent Design", "Creationists"

5. Messages are not coming from "God" in outer space, they are coming from authors of books, poetry, songwriters, etc. Mohammad was a poet, speaking his own subconscious and making observations about the "group hive mind" (people around him).

ok, but the problem goes *way beyond* just famous religion books from thousands of years ago. Look at 1950's L Run Hubbard books.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard

Like, the power of convincing people to believe fiction is real reality... that' show cults work. That's how Edward Bernays advertising works, that's how marketing works.

Finnegans Wake is trying to wake people up to self-awareness of how language works on their mind. 

It's like Linux for your personal computer instead of Bible (Microsoft Windows) or Quran (Apple OS).
