Donald Trump is the greatest entertainer known to mankind. For over TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS, every social media meme addict flocks to him for content.  The USA has never had a more entertaining and thrilling source of amusement, no media star has ever draw so much attention, time, coverage, mocking, hate.

"All that has happened is that the public has **adjusted to incoherence** and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the **Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion** than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by technological** diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” **Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody**."
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**

For those who don't know... "Howdy Doody" is an entertainment show, like Saturday Night Live for children. Donald Trump is playing an act, "Tony Clifton" is the name of the act. Neil Postman is a Manhattan professor, New York University (Trump home town). People eat the onion, eat it up, not learning a damn thing about Surkov in Russia. You are on ground zero of the IRA amusement-washing meme-washing of Trump and Putin. The U.S.A. was never gullible to Russia until year 2013. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLxpNiF0YKs

The Internet Research Agency "owns" social media, meme stupor population. Surkov students won! USA lost. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 - here is a truck stop instead of Saint Peters, the IRA won from Saint Peters.
