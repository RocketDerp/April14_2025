> He wasn't President in 2015 lol, lmao

Exactly. You are a tool. As if anyone who is capable of composing a message on Reddit isn't able to determine who was President in year 2015.

The book I cited to you days ago in this message thread was published in year 2014. When Trump was not President.

The agreement Trump made November 7, 2012 for the formation of the Russian Internet Research Agency in Saint Pete was before Trump was President. The planning to invade Reddit in March 2013 took a lot of time.

You are avoidant of the nonfiction learning. I have given you several books on printed paper and you (and your father the Fox News addict to fiction) can't engage authentic learning about Russian information warfare. You "Eat The Onion". I can feature you over on /r/TrumpOnionFans who think "The Onion" is factual news. Who have never seriously studied Tony Clifton acting of NYC Andy Kaufman and recognize Donald Trump's fixation on SNL NYC. You are bamboozled and a "tool" of Putin and Trump.
