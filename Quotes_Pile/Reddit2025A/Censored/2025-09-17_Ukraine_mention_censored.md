> How do people not know when to use 'you're' and 'your'

I have studied this topic for over 40 years since I am constantly corrected due to specific brain damage that I have.

It isn't an issue of memory, not one of memorization. For me it is comparable to dyslexia.  You can read on Reddit in support groups of people describing their brain ***disorder*** https://old.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/vr144v/typing_with_autism/

There are mistakes I have been making over and over for decades. I can put a paper on my desk with the correct word-choice or usage and I still make the same errors.

Verbally really irritates people too. Regional accents, language translations / adoptions. How you say the name "Stephen" in Spanish language vs. English in North America.

Since the start of the Ukraine war in year 2014, many people in USA learned that the way we verbally speak the food dish "Chicken Kiev" was actually now a newly known insecurity ;) "Stuffed chicken breast is generally known in Russian and Ukrainian cuisines as c√¥telette de volaille."

For English writers and speakers, I recommend at least a dozen iterations of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book to address the Tower of Babel issues.
