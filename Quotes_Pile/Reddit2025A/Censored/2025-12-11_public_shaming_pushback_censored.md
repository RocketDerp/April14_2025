You did not answer me, are you a doctor to diagnose me? I  asked you a question: "You a doctor? Diagnosing who? Jean Erdman from the linked TV video?" -  you seem manipulative and evasive. There are ethical issues about you declaring this to my face in public.

Are you gate keeping people with mental disorders on Reddit? Are you a paid professional, working for a business on Reddit? Some kind of health care influence who messages people the think have mental disorders?

Is it my use of English, are you gate-keeping Immigrants to the USA?

When you go into public places, such as a public park, do you diagnose people who you think of as handicapped or imperfect? Do you get up into their personal space and say intimate personal things to strangers?
