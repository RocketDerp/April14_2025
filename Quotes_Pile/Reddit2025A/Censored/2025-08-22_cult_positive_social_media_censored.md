> The problem is what to do.

I agree that is the major unsolved problem for most USA people.

A lot of people are stroking guns and want to live out the American stereotype of gun worship on the world stage and make headlines..

We are dealing with media cults. Fox News fiction cult. Donald Trump fiction content cult. Newsmax fiction cult. Facebook memes fiction cult. Elon Musk Twitter fiction cult. Subreddit fiction cults.

A powerful answer is to halt entertainment. Maybe one or two days a week at first, expanding to every day. Sustained use of social media to teach nonfiction. The public library is full of books about cult deprogramming and describe the behavior of cults. Teach and educate, be serious, stop low-effort entertainment and sports consumption and show that people are willing to stand up for literacy and goodness. Not just stand up for gun worship that the rest of the world expects of USA television addicts.

The entire World Wide Web, not just USA, can join in with the education effort about cult deprogramming and addictions to fiction Donald Trump content.
