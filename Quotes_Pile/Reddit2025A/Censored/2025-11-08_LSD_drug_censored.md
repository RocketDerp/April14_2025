University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan famously said on television broadcast that Joyce's Finnegans Wake was LSD drug. Same kind of "Woke" through reading out loud.

I'd argue that when it comes to James Joyce, anyone who favors fiction storytelling over science reality is dreaming in one way or another. The Bible being a mind virus, disclosed in verse John 1:1 (also implying the Torah is a mind virus).

There is a report of pain in being "Woke" / Wake to reality itself. Carol boozes up like Tim Finnegan.
