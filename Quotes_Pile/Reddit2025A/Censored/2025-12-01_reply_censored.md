> You write like a loony not because I have a problem with "diverse" use of the English language as I am quite fond of Proust.

So you are addicted to a certain style of writing and you are anti-diverse from people outside that style.  You are a English language bigot.  You don't want people to communicate in their own original style and you want them to conform to your (input / reading / consumption) expectations.

> REDDT TOPIC: White House Publicly Targets Media Outlets... Launches 'Hall of Shame' Section

So you think a reddit comment you don't like is "Fake News", and "loony" - you behave just like Donald Trump and MAGA. egoism / egomania.

> You write like a loony because you went 0 to 1000 without even seeing my level of interest on the topic. There's no awareness of your audience.

You have no self-awareness of the program that Cambridge Analytica has put into your mind. The **off-Reddit link** you are doing (active measures) everything you can to turn attention away from. https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/

Which this link, repeating, relates to the White House and Kremlin media. https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/

Which you are here to target me for raising my voice on.

> Either way you're still wrong. This all started at the cold war. 

That's your response to me bring up the monomyth wars of Torah vs. Quran .vs. Bible. Which is far before the "Cold War" when the Spanish brought the Bible to the Americas year 1492 and beyond.

> > you can't even see September 11, 2001 - the Bible MAGA forces in USA... , and Saudi Arabia Mecca vs. Western World (especially "The Great Satan" of Founding Fathers reason thinking). Taliban defeated USA. 

> Either way you're still wrong. This all started at the cold war. 

By your simple logic: the invention of the atom bomb in the 1940's started the conflicts of Mohammad Quran storytelling in year 635 in regards to the Taliban.
