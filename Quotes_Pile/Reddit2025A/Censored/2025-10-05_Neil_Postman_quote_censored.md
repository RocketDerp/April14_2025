Mocking Trump is the appeal. People can not resist gong to meme sites and mocking and insulting Trump playing President Tony Clifton. Trump is a New Yorker, he knows SNL and Andy Kaufman. Trump and others playing Tony Clifton is like shooting fish in a barrel, people keep eatin up the act. People in USA refuse to take Putin's methods seriously enough, can't even describe Russian Surkov tactics of the past 25 years.

Study media ecology, study social media. This is all spelled out in a 1985 book by a Manhattan professor (Trump's home turf).

We had an entertainer president back in year 1985, that is when the book was published.

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."
