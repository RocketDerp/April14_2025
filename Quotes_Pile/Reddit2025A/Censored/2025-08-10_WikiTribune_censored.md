> how shocked I am that the media absolutely buried this story.

People are largely not interested in nonfiction. Reddit has been online since July 2005, more than two full decades. Nothing prevents people from upvoting content and reposting content.  Audiences have little desire for nonfiction other than things like kitten images and such. This pattern of media ecology plays out throughout human history and in all geography.  Fox News provides fiction storytelling, Donald Trump provides fiction, Reddit audiences haven't utilized their platform or WikiTribune or other platforms to address it... people would rather complain over and over every week.
