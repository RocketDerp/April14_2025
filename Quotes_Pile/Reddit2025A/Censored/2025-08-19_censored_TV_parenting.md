“As a television show, and a good one, "Sesame Street" does not encourage children to love school or anything about school. It encourages them to love television.”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 (this 1985 book's main focus is explaining Donald Trump / Ronald Reagan second term in office)
