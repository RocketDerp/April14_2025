They can't distinguish fiction from nonfiction. You will find this pattern throughout history all over the world. Malala talks about it in her book after getting shot. You can see how people embrace ChatGPT since year 2022, entirely unable to grasp what is fiction. We do not teach in our schools that all religions are fiction, it is a global problem and eventually rulers exploit it. People in one religion (believers of fiction) will call the people in other religions dumb stupid idiots, just as you see today with MAGA... calling liberals stupid.  A completely avoidance of nonfiction in the situation.

*  “The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.” - Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

* “The other nine, decent, hard-working, ordinarily intelligent and honest men, did not know before 1933 that Nazism was evil. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil. And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45, published 1955.
