Bible is science fiction (outer space angels). What you describe... Yes, that's the famous scene in Star Wars 1977!! Use your Gut. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ... JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The thing to do is learn to live in your period of history as a human being. That’s something else, and it can be done. BILL MOYERS By doing what? CAMPBELL: By holding to your own ideals for yourself and, like Luke Skywalker, rejecting the system’s impersonal claims upon you. BILL MOYERS: When I took our two sons to see Star Wars, they did the same thing the audience did at that moment when the voice of Ben Kenobi says to Skywalker in the climactic moment of the last fight, “Turn off your computer, turn off your machine and do it yourself, **follow your feelings, trust your feelings.”** And when he did, he achieved success, and the audience broke out into applause. CAMPBELL: Well, you see, that movie communicates. It is in a language that talks to young people, and that’s what counts. It asks, Are you going to be a person of heart and humanity—because that’s where the life is, from the heart—or are you going to do whatever seems to be required of you by what might be called “intentional power”? When Ben Kenobi says, “May the Force be with you,” he’s speaking of the power and energy of life, **not of programmed political** intentions.
