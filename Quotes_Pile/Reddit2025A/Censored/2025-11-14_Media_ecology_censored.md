... insult-talk. I'm here quoting about the topics of an entire society, and your egoism / egomania wants to talk about me.

>  I like Sagan but this is a pure opinion piece that can't even comprehend that Beavis & Butthead and Dumb & Dumber were overtly MOCKING stupidity, not glorifying it. 

Sagan can't comprehend media ecology. Faith in mocking and mockery. Very popular on Reddit. The religion here is:

1. Hide your real name, self-dehumanize. Unlike Facebook or YouTube where people use real faces, real names, here on Reddit only wealthy and famous people like Vince Gilligan get real names used.

2. Love machines, insult people. Ruled by technology lust.

3. Prize cleverness.

4. Anti-empathy, anti-compassion, anti-goodness.  Mock and attack sincerity.

What Cal Sagan described in that 1995 quote is the reality of USA society year 2025, Reddit society. Lead by leaders who have followed the leadership of Reality TV stars / fiction Twitter owners, etc.

You sound like a media addict unwilling to see the crisis of a society that abandoned scientific thinking / nonfiction learning in favor of amusement.

> MOCKING stupidity, not glorifying it

Just like the Middle East 3 major religions that all mock each other.

Science Fiction Quran mocking Science Fiction Torah. It's in the world news a lot lately. Abandonment of compassion and equality and goodness itself in favor of favorite fiction story factions.

Reddit vs. Twitter, Fox News vs. MSNBC. Fiction vs. fiction vs. fiction. Alternate universes, alternate realities. All celebrating their independent fictions and avoidance of serious nonfiction as that Sagan quote spelled out in year 1995.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.”
