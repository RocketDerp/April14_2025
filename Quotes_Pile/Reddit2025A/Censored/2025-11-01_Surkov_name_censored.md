I normally since year 2022 don't drop 'Surkov" word (keyword) on the front-page postings of Reddit, they are almost always censored.

"voted for".

Reddit users VOTED for, upvoted, anti-reality. EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY since year 2013. "What they", us vs. them. Abandonment of reality is what people on Reddit voted for November 1, 2025. Reddit vs. Twitter, people just don't GET IT. No rescue of Trump, no rescue of MAGA from Kremlin. Surkov won, Putin won. There has been no effort to work together and get all people on the same page against The Russian "War Against Reality" described September 9, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/
