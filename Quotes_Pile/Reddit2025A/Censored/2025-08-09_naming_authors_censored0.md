You and your simplistic Twitter-length thinking don't have a clue about Russian information warfare. You only care to attack Americans like me who are defending against Putin's media invasion with factual education and not "fuck off American" reactionary thinking.

Putin mind-fucked Reddit users, Twitter users, the entire social media society. And you are in denial and your reaction shows it as you hate upon Americans.

Russia is not "both sides" with NATO. Russia is terrible and way better at information warfare than ignorant Americans who can't quote or cite a single bit of information from people like Adam Curtis, Peter Pomerantsev, Christopher Wylie. The anti-intellectualism in USA society August 2025 is horrific.
