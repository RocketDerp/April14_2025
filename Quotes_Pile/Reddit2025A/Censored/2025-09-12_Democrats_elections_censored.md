> Dems lost two elections trying to safe mode their candidates and declaring "Trump bad!"

Democrats lost two elections because We The People were directly manipulated by Russian information warfare on social media, including Reddit

1. Since year 2014 diseases like measles / RFK Jr. attitudes have been promoted by Russian and validated by George Washington University and Johns Hopkins university. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - but Democrats on Reddit and Bluesky can't  be bothered to keep repeating that Russia has manipulated RFK Jr. Measles are still spreading in 2025 in Texas and elsewhere because of Putin and social media.

Democrats lost because We The People are addicts to fiction. The Bible is fiction storytelling, Fox News is fiction storytelling, Joe Rogan is fiction storytelling, Russia and Kremlin provide anti-science fiction storytelling, Truth Social is not true and is fiction storytelling.

Republicans want liars and deceivers as leaders. Americans want entertainers (Reality TV Donald Trump "The Apprentice") as leaders. The everyday population has abandoned science thinking and intelligent people in favor of fiction entertainment Kremlin storytelling.

It is a war against nonfiction. A war against reality itself. People don't want real world science about measles and COVID-19, people in USA want memes and trash "Truth Social" and Elon Musk Twitter - fiction storytelling.

This is why Democrats do not win. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/  If you don't create nonstop entertainment and mockery, fiction storytelling, like Saudi Arabia or Russia, you don't win anymore in USA. People here in USA want memes and artificial intelligence trash like Trump provides. People don't want authentic science and sincere factual based reality for leaders.

Go look at the bookstore and cinema. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Donald Trump provides constant fiction storytelling. The Kremlin and GOP both provide constant "Truth Social" fiction storytelling, along with the Church.

Carl Sagan spelled this trend out in a book 30 years ago.


“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995
