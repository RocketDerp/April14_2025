> We have an adult literacy crisis because public schools 

Adults do not learn in school classrooms, once adults depart school and turn on Fox News or Radio Mullah / etc... they adopt ideas from media they consume. You really need to learn media ecology. People parroting Fox News is a core to MAGA / USA 2025 society. Reddit users also parrot Reddit memes they consume, same with Bluesky. Everything is media ecology.

> federal Department of Education and watch the tears flow. I love this place!

In the message you just replied to, the immediate discussion context, I cited a nonfiction book from Malaa in Swat Valley, Pakistan. And you think the problem I am describing is controlled by the United States of America federal government.
