Satellite dishes are highly directional. 

Clearly human minds (post virus infection) can now communicate without needing air and verbal sound waves. It also is pretty high speed based on the lag time when Carol is using a telephone and the television responds. And when Carol prompts for unusual information (math problems, gynecological exams of plastic or metal).

So far, it looks to me like TCP/IP version 6 network with global multicast capability.

At one point in season 1, the White House Podium guy says that every person on Earth has tuned into the channel and is listening to Helen. 

On Multicast IP, you can tune into a channel or unsubscribe / resubscribe to a channel.

We also know that Carol can crash the ENTIRE NETWORK very fast, so there is a multicast capability from one single human ("Pirate Lady").
