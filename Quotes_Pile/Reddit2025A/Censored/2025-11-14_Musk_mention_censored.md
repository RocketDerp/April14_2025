Yes, I've seen it. I noted this early YouTube video that talked about how **optimization** / efficiency was a core focus as of the first two episodes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RQ74fKYZio

To me one thing should be front and center as established: rapid information exchange. Entire skills can be downloaded wireless to people. In The Matrix 1999, they have to be plugged into the goo pods or in the chairs on the hovercraft ships. 

They also don't seem to need to speak verbally to each other, it's instant perfect error-free communications. No language distortion from hive mind brain to hive mind brain.

Just having the correct information / correct understanding / best of the world's knowledge organized in a Wikipedia kind of system has huge implications for behavior and conflicts. 

A world where  there are no scam websites, trick marketing telephone calls, no robbers / no theft, no advertising or marketing manipulation... no Fox News / Musk Twitter.... lifts a huge burden off humanity. Suddenly every page on Wikipedia has the most correct information. No pranks, no jokes, no tricks, no sabotage.
