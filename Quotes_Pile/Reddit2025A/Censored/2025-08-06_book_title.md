They are acting like professionals. You just don't grasp how modern information warfare and population control works. By thinking this is all accidental and not being able to cite the origins, you are showing you are falling for the techniques instead off recognizing the trend. The book I suggest is: "Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia"

> the highest seat in the country. Act like a professional

They are professionals at getting your attention and engagement. Not being boring with facts and truth, but creating a fantasy world of fiction.
