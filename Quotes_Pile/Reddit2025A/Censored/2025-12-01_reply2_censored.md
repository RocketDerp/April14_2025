> I see you completely ignored the part about how to effectively convey a message. 

Your dictatorship, your praise of dictators, who demand how others use media systems. The very topic of this Reddit posting: "White House Publicly Targets Media Outlets... Launches 'Hall of Shame' Section"

>  how to effectively convey a message

Yha, using manipulation to avoid every off-Reddit link. Your techniques of conveying messages are subversion.

>  frothing at the mouth

Describing your self? Why do you keep pestering me, "Russia pest"?

> I love that Maga thinks I'm a "brigader" and libs think I'm Maga. 

Your words. You love it. Exactly what you love. War between Ukraine and Russia, war between Palestine and Israel, war between MAGA and non-MAGA. You think it's great that people use media systems (Reddit topic: "White House Publicly Targets Media Outlets... Launches 'Hall of Shame' Section") to cause information war.

> I love that Maga thinks I'm a "brigader" and libs think I'm Maga. 

You are a lover of information war outcomes. What the Internet Research Agency seeded on Reddit since March 2013. Exactly what I keep asserting, you are thrilled at USA media-warfare loss (hearts and minds to hate Americans). You are like a cheerleader to the kind of media platform (Elon Musk profiteer) of the hate vs. hate in the world.
