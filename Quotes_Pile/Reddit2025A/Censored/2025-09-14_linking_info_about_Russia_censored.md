> Trump gives everyone someone to look down on. Smart people look down on him and his cult. He and his cult look down on smart people. It’s why he’s so popular. 

EXACTLY! !!! THIS!!!!!!    
GREAT Description of how Surkov techniques work!!! 

President Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton captures everyone. Those who Hate the President Tony Clifton (acting / Reality Truth Social / Reality Twitter / Surkovian governing) and use social machines and conversations to mock and mock how terrible and bad Tony Clifton acts are.

You just described the Putin 16D chess that everyone thinks Trump is playing, when Surkov students are the screenplay writers and Trump is just the actor (as are many other qualified Fox News actors doing the Surkov student screenplays).

At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: **“We all know there will be no real politics,”** he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. **They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”**
