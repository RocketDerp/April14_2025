> Does Fox ever tell the truth?

Yes. August 26, 2018 Fox News https://www.foxnews.com/tech/russian-trolls-bots-spreading-discord-over-vaccine-safety-scientists-say told the truth about Russia, but nobody will pin it to the top of every subreddit. Fox News even repeated it shortly before Wuhan China airport spread a virus all over. February 17, 2019 https://www.foxnews.com/tech/russian-trolls-blamed-for-spreading-anti-vaccination-propaganda March 8, 2019 again https://www.foxnews.com/video/6011661548001 - alas, people can not assert and keep focused / ***eye on the ball*** of the Internet Research Agency. Why aren't these links repeated every day that RFK Jr is in power spreading measles? Reddit, why won't you stand up as a community to bullshit?
