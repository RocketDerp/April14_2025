They secret moderators link a COMMENT, remove a COMMENT, yet claim it is a posting / submission. I was NOT the account that created the submission. The moderators using shitty A.I. ?

People here on this subreddit won't even discuss that the Founding Fathers created the idea of the hive mind. And the lessons George Lucas filmed in the 1980's for audiences to understand such matters. Lessons about the meaning of "Pluribus" were filmed by Lucas himself at Skywalker ranch and published in 1988 book "The Power Of Myth". Lucas is a science fiction author legend all across the world.. when he started filming the audience lessons in summer of 1985, he was at the PEAK of world fame and power. 

Vance Gilligan is way ahead of the audience on your meme concept of people being scared of equality, downvote disagree, etc.

EDIT: Stating facts gets you downvoted here. -2 on this comment after 12 minutes.

EDIT 2: Now the Moderators REMOVED this comment? Why? For mentioning George Lucas about a science fiction show? Mentioning a nonfiction book?
