> It's okay to be divided from bad people.

To Putin and the Internet Research Agency / Cambridge Analytica manipulated minds, Earth itself is to be attacked. All humans and all life are "bad people". Running away from Kremlin and White House and MAGA and Russian cults of fiction is a danger to all humanity.

> Liberals need to stop pretending we're all in this together. 

You are the one creating fiction messages on a meme mill, amusement center of Reddit, pretending humanity is not all connected. Where was your computing device manufactured? Who created the transistors? Who created the English language you compose in? Who created Unicode? Who runs the cloud computing storage? 

> Liberals need to stop pretending

"Liberals" need to stop pretending this one-bit binary "Us vs. Them", "Liberal vs. Conservative" isn't nonsense. The Founding Fathers gave us a pyramid out of Africa with 13 steps up. No left, no right, no liberal, no conservative. That bullshit fiction one-bit "God of Levant gave King of France right and left seating" crap is anti-American at core. That is "Old World Order".

## "Novus Ordo Seclorum"

A new world order of 13 steps up a pyramid to thinking of Carl Sagan.

Not thinking of "us vs them" and Levant Satan vs. God logic bullshit. MAGA thinks liberals are Satan. Unable to distinguish fiction from nonfiction. Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica mind-fucked everyone into out-group hate patterns of the Levant mythology systems.

# Eye in the Sky: Pale Blue Dot

"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand."
