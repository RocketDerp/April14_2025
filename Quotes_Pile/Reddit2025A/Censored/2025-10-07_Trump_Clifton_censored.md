You are "Eating the Onion".  You don't see it is multiple performers on multiple stages. RFK Jr doing antics is following Putin techniques. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

> he could master a craft ðŸ¤£

His craft is making you LOL LOL LOL at him all day and night. That's how Surkov mastered governing for Putin for the past 25 years.

You need to read nonfiction and face your own addiction to fiction storytelling. This is the "old world order" as defined by the Founding Fathers in 1776. Mecca is a science fiction theme park (comparable to Disney Star Wars theme park). Fiction has been used to rule humanity for thousands of years, not nonfiction and science.

Trump is the most charming performer ever in all world history. Bigger than Jesus and The Beatles combined. He knows exactly how to draw an audience to giving up nonfiction and science learning.  Trump grew up in NYC, SNL / Andy Kaufman. He is the best Tony Clifton actor among all of them. People eat it up, fall for it, every time. His Tony Clifton dress-up games, his self-declared that he is the greatest person in the world https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQgjpnr5e2s , all part of Tony Clifton screenplays / Surkov student screenplays.

Media outlets like Reddit have all flocked to the entertainment Trump provides. This is the true-world version of "Infinite Jest V". Putin won the information war for over a decade and people can't even call out Surkov techniques by name here on Reddit.
