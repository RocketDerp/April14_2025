**Harlan Ellison's Solution for Palestine and Israel**

2:07     
I am the senior editorial reporter for the Jerusalem Post and I would love to interview you. And I said just fire away. And the first out of his mouth is... what do you as an American Jew think of the situation in the Middle East? And I said to him: well, why would you ask me that... I'm a writer... I write amusing little fantasies. I'm a professional liar, I'm not a political commentator. I don't know what your people are going through over there. I have no comment...

2:30    
... I have no opinion. no no, he says, we're anxious to hear what you think. And he nudges and nudges and pushes at me already. I know I'm going to hate Israel and he keeps saying I want to know what you think. We want to know what you want. And he sounds like Jackie Mason. So I say: listen, trust me, you don't want my opinion yeah. He screams: we want your opinion! we're dying for your opinion! we're pling to have your opinion! He goes on and on and on he will not let me off the hook.

So finally I reach the pimel line and I say okay... but remember the old Chinese adage be careful what you wish for because you might get it. And he goes: "haaha, extremely clever! So what is your opinion?" And I said... here's my opinion:

**All of you guys out there in the Middle East are out of the same Melting Pot. And you're all as crazy as a butterfly on absenth**. I don't know whether you're all Canaanites at the base or you're all Jews at the base or out of the land of Nod or whatever the hell you were at the get go. Semites or whatnot, but **you've been fighting there now for something like 8,000 years. And you've never had 5 minutes of quiet and peace. You're forever killing each other and sticking knives at each other and burning babies and the world has had to suffer with this.**

Great things have come out of the Middle East. Great things like the rubat of Omar kayam but stupidity seems to be your chief export. Stupidity and violence are your cash crops all you. And **this was before September 11th** and I said my solution to the problem in the Middle East is this:

We erect a wall 26 mile high around the entire Middle East about 14 mile deep... that's Syria Lebanon Saudi Arabia Iraq Iran Israel Egypt... all of you, the whole bunch of you. 26 mile high with one door. Like a regular door in the front of a house. And every 10 years we will open the door and look inside. If you're still fighting... we close the door.

4:25    
And as we say in yish loen gain let be you should live and be well go and fight and kill yourselves and no one will interfere. But if we peek inside and it's safe, if it's nice and it's comfy and there's flowers growing... if you're not fighting and you got peace and quiet you can come out and play with the rest of us like human people.

And the guy says: "what?", and I said: "do you want me to repeat that?" and he says "no thank you very much". Bam, he hangs up on me. Within an hour USIA calls up and says: tour is off.

4:54   
And I tell you I was relieved. Being a tough Jew is like being a tough Oriental kid kid in an all black
neighborhood. It's like being an Irish kid in a Latino neighborhood. When you're an outsider, you got two choices: you either become a target for people to hit you to bully you and con you... to take advantage of you... and you wind up marrying people you shouldn't... and you wind up in a job you shouldn't have with people who bully you... or you get tough.
