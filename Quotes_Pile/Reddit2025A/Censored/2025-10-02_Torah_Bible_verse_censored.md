> There are plenty of passages in the Torah and bible that also explicitly condone religious violence.

The Torah is science fiction, angels from outer space, magical burning bush signals from outer space. Like Hamlet's ghost story, like Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghost" voices.  Bible is a retcon science fiction of the Torah, more magical storytelling.

Bible verse "1 John 4:20" emphasizes the Levant crisis thousands of year ago that is still ongoing in year 2025. People who read poetry and rock music song lyrics and think they are hearing the voice of God from outer space. "I love God" is wrong - Bible verse "1 John 4:20". You are supposed to love human persons, real living people, not storytelling characters.
