All the minds of the world have warned Carol multiple times that the free thinkers can be dangerous and the hive mind can not protect them from the free thinkers.

That's the real world of human beings. You take away the guard-rails of society, no life guards at the ocean, and there is a rip tide.

What kind of American person takes a loaded gun into their house, assumes it is a toy, and shoots their house guest why boozing and taking pills? In New Mexico no less, where a famous actor took a prop gun on a set and killed someone thinking it was a dummy weapon.  YOU NEVER assume a gun is a toy and point it at someone. Pull the trigger. Middle aged adults.

Sarcasm-poisoning / irony-poisoning is Fox News culture. Gun worship / weapon worship USA American stereotype. 

Helen claims to be such an expert in satire, but only wants English speakers. Very American immigrant attitude. She knows Spanish to hate and curse people. Very American attitude of dominating immigrants.

Don't even get me started about minute 23 of episode one and Finnegans Wake language and sarcasm. 

If Carol is so threatened by the hive mind, why invite them right into your house? What she is afraid of is being sober. Her wife Helen scolded her and took her keys at the airport.
