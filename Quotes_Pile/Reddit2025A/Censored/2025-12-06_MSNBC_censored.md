Reddit published it instantly when comment created, later I edited the comment and added the P.S. at the bottom with "MSNBC", then the comment was unpublished / censored by Reddit.

> There's no louder hive mind than people who say "oppression" and "I lived near Seattle."

My god do you have no idea of the dogma of your own Reddit media environment.

I worked for Bill Gates and Paul Allen, I lived in working-class Renton. I was there for the [Halloween Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents) Linux sabotage, I was there when Bill Gates saved his Pepsi/Coke two-party Apple and Microsoft. I was a media analyst and expert on social media, a total outsider from the IBM OS/2 side.

> There's no louder hive mind 

I've lived in north Africa and Middle East during the Arab Spring for years to study media ecology *hive minds*, you  are so Apple defending of USA you can't even grasp "Adam and Eve" and the Apple scene of Carol saying puck an Apple in episode six. **Largest hive mind you think is in Bellevue, Washington Microsoft** - nope, it is Levant Torah / Bible / Quran hivemind of science fiction trilogy.

The ignorance of Reddit anti-intellectual dogma.

The biggest Hive Mind leaders are people like Mohammad and  Martin Luther from Germany.

* At minute 22 in Episode One of Pluribus TV show... Helen brings up Finnegans Wake and her whole world goes to an end. I suggest you study James Joyce's 1923 "Finn's Hotel" about hive minds. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn%27s_Hotel

P.S. Rupert Murdoch isn't the only media empire creator with a USA TV network. Bill Gates started west-coast "MSNBC" in July 1996 (right before east-coast October 1996 Fox News) when I was in Bellevue. Now Apple TV+ is the west-coast Bill Gates TV network / media empire / music cartel / app cartel / podcast venue.

# New Reddit censorship technique?

The 3 means up-stream thread, pre, but the 3rd message / final message also got replies that are not showing. If you click the middle message permalink you get the reply to appear:

<img width="1984" height="1402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05e8e6ca-040a-4fae-9e06-e02da1b1010b" />

But still messages are entirely unpublished, notably the one at the top of this GitHub page: https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1peky11/anyone_also_banned_from_official_pluribustv_thread/nsla8oo/
