The first person emphasized Twitter-thinking and meme behaviors. That's all IRA outcomes since year 2013, it wasn't just Republicans and MAGA, it was the total population that is now meme addled and unable to escape the IRA aftermath that took hold by year 2015.

We The People never stood up to the real problem of every media platform being entertainment jjunk shit like described: *This is the action of some extremely online Twitter liberal staffers who post that sipping tea gif in response to stuff like “Donald Drumpf isn’t actually a billionaire”.*

We The People have embraced the Cambridge Analytica mind-fuck that Russia deployed with the IRA. We The People are in extreme denial that Russia won a psychological war.
