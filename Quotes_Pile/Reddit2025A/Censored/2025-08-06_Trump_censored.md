American people were *swayed* towards Trump. The more people mock and insult and focus on the absurd surreal behavior of Donald Trump (how he treated Ivanka), the more people are swayed by their lust for entertainment and his Tony Clifton behaviors on media. The cure to Trump is cut out entertainment and be serious. Quote nonfiction books (from dead authors, ideally) about the impact television has on audiences, crowds. Donald Trump is media, walking talking content.
