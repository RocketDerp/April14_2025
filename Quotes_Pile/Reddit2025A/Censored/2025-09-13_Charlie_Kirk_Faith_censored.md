You need to dive much deeper into *Finnegans Wake* to grasp what Charlie Clerk did not grasp in 2021 when he started "Turning Point Faith" / "TPUSA Faith", the Charlie Kirk Bible systems.

The message is not only the PAPER that Wake ( **Wokeness / Woke** ) is printed on but the paper The Holy Bible is printed on in Dublin.

I suggested Joseph Campbell to you earlier in this Reddit message thread, I'll quote him:

* *In Joyce’s next great work, Finnegans Wake, there is a mysterious number that constantly recurs. It is 1132. It occurs as a date, for example, and inverted as a house address, 32 West 11th Street. In every chapter, some way or another, 1132 appears. When I was writing A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, I tried every way I knew to imagine, “What the dickens is this number 1132?”* - Joseph Campbell, lessons for Star Wars fans filmed by George Lucas in summer of 1986, published in "Power of Myth" in 1988.

Charlie Kirk didn't grasp the  PAPER issue meaning, Bible verse Romans 11:32 - that the shooter was *ordered by God to sin, and kill Charlie*, at least within the realm of metaphors used in the Levant Bible.
