Senility? Most of them are not very old.

Mutually Assured Destruction.... "the concept became a cornerstone of U.S. defense policy in 1962, largely due to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The term itself was coined in the same year by strategist Donald Brennan. The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 further highlighted the reality of MAD, as it brought the world to the brink of nuclear war." - Real  Reality, NONFICTION Earth


JUST MAYBE self-harm and hate should not be the foundation of education across an entire planet.

"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves."
