> Russia isn't the problem anyway. 

Yha, I get replies like this on Reddit all the time. People who won't name the "Internet Research Agency" and "Cambridge Analytica" and discuss any specifics of the players and timelines.

Message creators who say 3 paragraphs of original text on Reddit without linking or quoting any books. Who prize disposable commenting and deflect away from researched citations with real names and real author names. Why? Because current Reddit comment culture is all about avoiding nonfiction off-Reddit links. people commenting without reading nonfiction sources.

All planned since year 2012. "Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года."

> Russia isn't the problem anyway. 

It isn't what the IRA and CA are doing in November 2025 that is the problem, it is the mental programming that the psychologists and psychiatry doctors did back in 2014 and 2015 that created MAGA cults. Fiction addict cults. Social media addicts who won't quote or cite or link or read off-Reddit nonfiction sources.
