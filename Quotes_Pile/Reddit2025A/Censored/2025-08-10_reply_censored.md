> You realize the article you linked 

As I said before, now again: are you confused? I did not link any article.

>  article you linked supports everything I said in the comment 

The article *I cited* has very specific keywords that you in no way mentioned. Nor do you grasp that even linking the article gets the comment removed from Reddit, and even a mention of some of the content gets the comment removed. I think you don't grasp how deep conservatives control Reddit messages. 

>  I was making a joke.

Just like conservatives in USA August 2025, everything serious about the topic of the December 20, 2013 article I cited is a 'hoax" or "joke" or funny, LOL.
