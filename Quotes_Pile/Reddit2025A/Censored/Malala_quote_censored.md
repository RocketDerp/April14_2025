>  i literally cannot stand most Muslim representation (or any marginalized representation bc it also applies) in shows because they nearly always get it wrong/bad and it ends up being horrible propaganda

"With an estimated population of almost 2 billion followers, Muslims comprise around 26% of the world's total population."

The Torah, Bible, Quran are all extreme propaganda. Each group claims story supremacy over the entire public library,  a type of book supremacy. Propaganda is at the core of clergy attracting audiences, out-group hate patterns (Shia vs. Sunni internal, Quran vs. infidel and Torah / Upanishads, etc) and being dishonest that science fiction popularity does not  make for historical fact.

> t ends up being horrible propaganda

I view it as all inclusive problem. Atheists are not honest that Quran / Torah / Bible are **science fiction stories** that are even more popular than Star Wars or Hamlet's Ghost. Nobody wants to end the conflicts, people rather hate from science fiction vs. science fiction platform.

We have airports and Internet all over the world, we really need to fix this literacy problem of fiction vs. nonfiction.

* “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”

* “If Christians, Hindus or Jews are really our enemies, as so many say, why are we Muslims fighting with each other?”
