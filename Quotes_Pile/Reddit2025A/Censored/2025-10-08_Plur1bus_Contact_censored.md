Along these lines, I still need to study the show more.

I know Carl Sagan's Contact book and film far better at this point. I suggest anyone thinking of 'hostile alien' theories should familiarize yourself with it.

Private jets / meetings on jets play a big role in Contact. The telescope array plays a big part of story in Contact. And the final government testimony / investigation of the event as a hoax in Contact presents the theory that an American billionaire with space interest (Microsoft's Paul Allen,SpaceX Elon Musk, Amazon's /Blue Origin Jeff Bezos for real-world examples) had the technical resource to fake the signal in such a way it would convince even serious scientists it was from deep space origin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CiG9Wgvyj0

Introduction aside...

In episode 1 of Plur1bus, they showed a lot of people coming to the antenna array and seeing the signal. The question I have currently:

1. Did any other nation verify the signal? Did they depict any other location confirming the signal?

2. Was the 78 second message shared outside the United States of America?

3. Was the USA the only nation to create the RNA sequence?

4. "Scientists at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases manage to recreate the nucleotide sequence." - and it escapes with the mouse bite

5. It is notable there are a large number of people who are analyzing the 78 second outer space signal.  I did not witness any military involvement or discuss of secrecy or "competitive" / "national security" concerns. Did anyone else catch anything about that?

6. There were a huge number of rats and people in lab suits working with the rats. Do we know if they are kept in the dark about the origins of the RNA sequence. Are they aware it is from outer space?

&nbsp;

In Contact, the topic of national security of the outer-space message is a large topic and part of the dialog. The message was shared by the scientists to Australia and made the rounds in the science community circles before the military had a chance to stop t / restrict it.

&nbsp;

Back to your posting and general concerns.

If the message was not shared outside the USA and kept secret, the RNA sequence not known by any nation other than the USA - the ease of some billionaire faking the sequence and convincing people it was from outer-space goes up much higher. And the idea itself is known to billionaires because of Carl Sagan's Contact book and film presenting the idea.

Within the Pluribus story, the outer-space alien signal could have been faked by humans and it was a bamboozle. Develop a RNA sequence to enslave the human population, deploy it, and fabricate a story about it being from outer space.
