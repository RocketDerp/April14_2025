> You keep making claims about me as if you know anything at all about me.

I keep pointing you to content outside Reddit. I linked you a website with March 1967 content from University of Toronto on the relevant topics of this Reddit posting.  Your "What the Fuck" reply is the problem.

> you’re coming across as quite an asshole.

You are a cyber bully who goes "What The Fuck" LOUDLY to strangers in public. Further, the topic is INCREDIBLY serious: "Mark Zuckerberg's vision for humanity is terrifying"

> you’re coming across as quite an asshole.


You go along to people who seriously discuss Mark Zuckerberg's media empire and scream at them in public discourse "WHAT THE FUCK!"

You have raging egomania. Have I repeated myself enough times?
