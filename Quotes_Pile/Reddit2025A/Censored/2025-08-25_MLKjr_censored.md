>  Blind loyalty to some foreign nationality is not something we should be doing, Heck Iâ€™m not even blindly loyal to everything America does. 

Loyalty to *badness itself* is terrible, regardless if blind or eyes wide open. Loyalty to falsehoods, loyalty to fiction, loyalty to anti-empathy, loyalty to anti-goodness - every one bad and terrible. It is a global problem that has no geography except the human brain.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true. That's what hate does. You can't see right. The symbol of objectivity is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.
