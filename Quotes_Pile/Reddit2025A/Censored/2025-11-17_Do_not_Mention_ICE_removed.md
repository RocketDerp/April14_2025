The last thing I saw was Carol calling her sworn enemy to come over with a loaded gun. Carol getting loaded on booze (liquid courage) and drugs and playing with a loaded weapon... pointing it at an African immigrant to the USA - and pulling the trigger on that African immigrant like she is an I.C.E. programmed white person.  While watching Betty White, in the association of a show famous for Mr. White (who wrecks society with intelligence) and a white supremacy group (Todd's gang).

When an American orders you into their office, offers you booze, and lays a loaded gun on the table pointing at you... it is a Godfather kind of meeting / a final goodbye.

Carl was being INCREDIBLY threatening to the hive mind if they used Helen's memories. Revenge /  payback / nothing left to lose murder-suicide.
