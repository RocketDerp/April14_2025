> He absolutely does know. That's why he's constantly calling other people "stupid" and "low IQ" while bragging about how he "aced" a cognitive test. It's probably the least subtle example of projection in the history of our country, that I can tell you. 

EXACTLY.  Finally a single comment here that realizes that Trump is an actor doing a performance.  And he is far from the only one. Musk with his chainsaw on stage and doing antics like Tony Clifton making carrot juice on stage.

Reddit users are entirely ignorant of how Putin has run Russia for over 25 years. 

> He absolutely does know. 

He  has wanted to be the biggest star in the world and he mastered Twitter at an old age when most old people can't even dial a telephone. He runs circles around 14 year old children on touch devices who can't understand that there is an SNL Andy Kaufman act going on.

Americans eat up the **President Tony Clifton** act every day for over ten fucking years. Michael Moore is one of the few people who gets the entertainment mind-blowing going on in the nation.  Did nobody ever see "Roger and me"  film?

People here on this comment section eat it up, entirely eating The Onion, unable to grasp how **Surkov**ian governing works.
