The message was published by Reddit at first, then after editing it after the block, Reddit unpublished my message.

https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1nr27ly/trump_freaks_out_over_comeys_defense_getting_good/ngu5729/

Sequence of timing:

1. Reddit servers instaly published the reply, the top part of message

2. I edited my reply several minutes later to ADD more content at the bottom.

3. Reddit unpublsihed / censored the message.
  
4. Even if I now remove the newly added content at the bottom, it remains unpulbished / censored from public.

Why? I'm live blogging every one of your messages on another platform (not Reddit). Because you are another example of a Putin tool

You are Active Measures on Reddit.

Comes along to Reddit to mock nonfiction books published in 2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Is_True_and_Everything_Is_Possible about Russian information warfare on Reddit itself. Then blocks to prevent further Reply messages. A mock and block tactic of information warfare.

REPLY to the last message before blocking:

> Lucky-Earther : make sure to tell everyone that you can't call Trump an idiot

Instructing "make sure to" that people should be told that they are not allowed to call Trump an idiot. Why would a Russian tool want to tell Americans that they can't call Trump an idiot? Why would you go around in public telling people to "shut up" about Donald Trump?
