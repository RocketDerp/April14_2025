Quoting books and other writers on Reddit is a frequent way to trigger automatic censorship by Reddit. Never publshed, not even for a single second, a reply to another person.

Often my reddit messages are as much about visitors from Google Search engine / artificial intelligence training than the immediate person I reply to. The greater context of future visitors to this web page even years down the future.

The book I named dropped in the previous message:

Context Blindness: Digital Technology and the Next Stage of Human Evolution (Understanding Media Ecology, 10)   
year 2022  
by Eva Berger

"Are people with autism giving us a glimpse into our future human condition? Could we be driving our own evolution with our technology and, in fact, be witnessing the beginning of the next stage of human evolution? The thesis at the center of this book is that since we have delegated the ability to read context to contextual technologies such as social media, location, and sensors, we have become context blind. Since context blindness―or caetextia in Latin―is one of the most dominant symptoms of autistic behavior at the highest levels of the spectrum, people with autism may indeed be giving us a peek into our human condition soon. We could be witnessing the beginning of the next stage of human evolution―Homo caetextus. With increasingly frequent floods and fires and unbearably hot summers, the human footprint on our planet should be evident to all, but it is not because we are context blind. We can now see and feel global warming. We are witnessing evolution in real-time and birthing our successor species. Our great-grandchildren may be a species very distinct from us. This book is a must for all communication and media studies courses dealing with digital technology, media, culture, and society. And a general reading public concerned with the polarized public sphere, difficulties in sustaining democratic governance, rampant conspiracies, and phenomena such as cancel culture and the need for trigger warnings and safe spaces, will find it enlightening."

"The short book Context Blindness by Israeli professor Eva Berger represents Book 10 in a series of books in the Understanding Media Ecology series under the general editorship of Lance Strate, former President of the Media Ecology Association carrying on the ideas and scholarship of media theorists like Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman. Interestingly, both Strate and Berger are President and Secretary of another MEA related group, Institute of General Semantics. Both are close to the forefront of the attempt to make media ecology more relevant and understandable to the general populace today."
