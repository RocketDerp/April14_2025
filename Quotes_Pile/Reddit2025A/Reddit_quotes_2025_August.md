"And most people don't care about others enough to do it. Either that, or our nation is too hyper-individualistic. You have to genuinely care about community to participate in a general strike, and that's not something our nation puts much stock in as a whole."

"This is not like Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with actual small claims disputes. The people involved sign contracts saying they‚Äôll agree with whatever ruling the ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù makes. The show would then make the payouts instead of the parties involved in the case. People would agree because, guess what, üí∞üí∞. The clip above however, is just some ‚Äúactors‚Äù doing a skit in order to invoke the smooth brains into thinking they‚Äôve witnessed some type of justice taking place. When, in actuality, they‚Äôve essentially been conned. None of it‚Äôs real."

"Seriously, this whole thread feels like everyone's gone mad. What the hell is going on?

Did everyone get collectively dumber or something?"

"I've seen this argument a few times and it annoys me. I agree with you. Making a new account to ask advice was standard practice until apparently now it's dodgy and proof it's fake?"

"After finding out that some college started doing social engineering experiments on Reddit posting shit like this I don't believe anything I read anymore."

"He won because the media did nothing but stoke people‚Äôs feeling about high cost of living under Biden. That narrative disappeared as soon as Trump won. Liberal media is a myth."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Liberal mediais a myth", yes (nonfiction media is unpopular) .. but no, we are still free to choose in August 2025. Nonfiction media is still on the shelf, largely ignored. The crisis is global and we need to look outside the USA to see the patterns. [Fiction vs. nonfiction. Conservaties are attracted to fiction](Misc0/2025-07-29_conservatives_ethnic.md). Bluntly: people lack courage, bravery, balls to sustain repeating that the problem is *amusement entertainment* vs. nonfiction. People would rather spend time complaining about how terrible news is, hours each day complaining, than actually seek out books on media ecology and quote them. ===:::
