"And most people don't care about others enough to do it. Either that, or our nation is too hyper-individualistic. You have to genuinely care about community to participate in a general strike, and that's not something our nation puts much stock in as a whole."

"This is not like Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with actual small claims disputes. The people involved sign contracts saying they‚Äôll agree with whatever ruling the ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù makes. The show would then make the payouts instead of the parties involved in the case. People would agree because, guess what, üí∞üí∞. The clip above however, is just some ‚Äúactors‚Äù doing a skit in order to invoke the smooth brains into thinking they‚Äôve witnessed some type of justice taking place. When, in actuality, they‚Äôve essentially been conned. None of it‚Äôs real."

"He won because the media did nothing but stoke people‚Äôs feeling about high cost of living under Biden. That narrative disappeared as soon as Trump won. Liberal media is a myth."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Liberal mediais a myth", yes (nonfiction media is unpopular) .. but no, we are still free to choose in August 2025. Nonfiction media is still on the shelf, largely ignored. The crisis is global and we need to look outside the USA to see the patterns. [Fiction vs. nonfiction. Conservaties are attracted to fiction](Misc0/2025-07-29_conservatives_ethnic.md). Bluntly: people lack courage, bravery, balls to sustain repeating that the problem is *amusement entertainment* vs. nonfiction. People would rather spend time complaining about how terrible news is, hours each day complaining, than actually seek out books on media ecology and quote them. ===:::

"I hate to be like this, but i do agree. I dont care how many "self-report" surveys and puff piece interviews and hot takes i encounter about some sort of justified anxiety or anger - people will contort themselves anyway necessary and say anything to preserve their egos and image and justify the way they act. Trump is a sick symptom of a sick society that incentivizes selfishness, cynicism and self-righteousness at almost every turn."

"Are you fucking serious?

Conspiratorial thinking?

There's a real life conspiracy happening right now where a Russian asset is in the Whitehouse covering for an international pedophile ring.

I think a little conspiratorial thinking is warranted.

And yes, I have been building my own conspiracy you might say to combat it.

It's really not outlandish or unrealistic, especially if you knew my background, the family I come from, and the many friends I've made in life.

You clearly only want to discredit me though.

I have a feeling this isn't about my safety.

And I don't care what happens to me on my quest to save my country.

It's a rational decision many have made before to wager their life for the greater good, and a real chance at happiness."

"America does need a mass deportation event...

All these people from Trump all the way down to his stupidest, most vile backwater supporter need to be deported to Mars on an experimental Musk rocket.

I'm not American and not even on the same continent but at some point hearing about the utter garbage coming from that country, you start to question why these ~~people~~ animals are allowed to exist on the same planet and in the same society as normal, adjusted people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA society values: deport those you disagree with or do not grasp/understand (speak a different language, Spanish, etc). Dehumanizing people as "animals", saying that even animals do not have a right to exist on the planet, total domination dictatorship, even over elimination of entire species of animals.

"MAGA is a deadly symptom, but it's not the disease. Almost everything we're experiencing today started because of Reagan. It's uncanny how the average American's life has been on a downward trajectory since his presidency. Trump and MAGA are the final death throes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : In 1985, after witnessing the 1984 second term election of Ronald Reagan, a New York University professor of media ecology published a book about Twitter, Reddit, Fox News 1996 called "Amusing Ourselves To Death"... this book should be understood by every single American age 12 to 120 in August 2025, it is only 184 pages. ===:::

"Could be in the form of a nightmare for all of us years from now. I've been wondering for awhile if the first female president would be not a Democrat, but a Kristi Noem or an MTG ...e.g, a repub female ...not a Democratic one. Maga's love 'em them politics-Barbies."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Even Ivanka Trump as a figurehead, with others doing most of the work. Ivanka could choose to have less of a media presence, or behave just like Donald on media, a complete freedom. The key thing is exploiting the "no female is electable" expectation with a MAGA supporter, to emphasize that Hillary Clinton was just a terrible choice (despite her Secretary of State experience and statements about ["Information War" in early 2011 against Putin/Russia](https://communicationleadership.usc.edu/2011/03/06/secretary-clinton-and-the-information-war/). Could you imagine Ivanka running on a slogan of "my father made some mistakes, I will fix them"? ===:::

"Aka the Thatcher problem. The right are only against women leaders to a point, but for a woman to get that far on the right they have to be more right-wing than a man would have to be to get that far, being almost performative.

That‚Äôs how the UK‚Äôs had three female prime ministers, and all of which were right wing and awful people. Sadly I fear that if MAGA were to have a female leader, they‚Äôre more likely to be closer to Liz Truss than Margaret Thatcher. At least Thatcher was intelligent and right wing, as opposed to Liz Truss, who was right wing and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think dealing with Donald Trump / JD Vance / MAGA it is best to halt all domestic focus and every social media user comment on conservative media (inclusive of religion) and conservative behavior all over the world. Let Malala from Pakistan speak. Describe the problem in every other nation on Earth and let that create a silhouette of not discussing Donald Trump directly. Make it about the values, behavior of Putin Kremlin and Taliban - and you promote the values you desire and show examples of goodness itself. Stop treating it like a short-term domestic-only problem of media literacy and Fox News, even Rupert Murdoch goes beyond just TV media (has newspapers) and USA. THIS is taking the high road, education and teaching about what "conservative" means all over Earth and the history of it. And for God's sake, cite books and articles by people and when people react-comment to a paragraph quote of a book, respond by encouraging them to discuss the entire book (read the book).... instead of generating more off-the-cuff reactionary (shallow) social media messages. ===:::

"Epstein is perhaps the closest things we've had to a bipartisan frustration among voters with the Trump administration that has ever existed and liberals on Reddit seem intent on shooting themselves in the dick by putting up false and easily debunked headlines and dropping them on the front page.

There's tons of really good reasons to think Trump is guilty of really terrible behavior regarding Epstein. Don't reach like this."

"This is one of my biggest issues with Reddit.

Full disclosure, I fucking hate Trump and if I were a betting man, absolutely betting he had sex with underage women.

That being said, I've seen about 15 posts now claiming Trump made 4700 payments to Epstein. That's not what they uncovered.

Just as you said, Trump may have paid Epstein, but the number is unknown.

Reddit always sets up some unlikely scenario, gets let down by reality, then complains about the world being rigged against them.

If it's literally a handful of payments, it could be business or party related expenses. It could by reimbursements. It could be kiddy diddling. It could be 4000 payments (suspicious as hell) or 10 payments (not a lot considering who they are)."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction outsells nonfiction. That's the whole basis of Fox News and Donald Trump success. Fiction is more popular than facts and truth. We have a media ecology crisis that spans decades. Neil Postman in 1985 published a book... It isn't that poeple aren't posting accurate information on Reddit, it is not popularity. People are not facing up that **Donald Trump is popular, mocking and hating Donald Trump is popular**. Non-fiction sincerity and science truth are not popular.

Dictator rules with an iron fist and every check and balance in place is a farce with people too scared to say no. So everyone just tells the Emperor his clothes look nice and everyone carries on.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  What Russia created for export and deployed since March 2013 is now  runaway monomyth patterns. They are artificial religions (fiction faiths) without compassion or love. It is weaponized out-group hate. And since year 2022, regurgitated by ChatGPT and other systems trained on all that social media.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Good news, a social media user who doesn't call Trump a do-nothing lazy man. Trump actually works incredibly hard for a man of age 79. Any YouTube creator will tell you the huge amount of labor being on-stage and creating content.

Less reality, less sense of time. Reddit had no image hosting years back, it was off-site previously.Long-form discussion was core to Reddit (like Usenet, long-form, not like text messaging and Twitter). The media ecology has changed to stream of timeless reactions. It is a good thing people post old content if framed as a reminder and how people are suffering from recency bias. Alas,that is not the context bewilderment being confronted, it is not framed as a reminder. This serves Trump... intentional (self-aware audience) or otherwise. ===:::

Front page Reddit posting, topics; Pizzagate, underage children sexual abuse and exploitation.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People attracted to out-group hate are attracted to this Reddit headline. Pizzagate was based upon calling Democrats sexual abusers of children, and [was taken seriously (Comet Ping Pong, among other wildcard locations)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory). What attracts people to Pizzagate is false information, information strip tease, bullshit and misunderstandings. Revealed also is that since October 8, 2013 - the book by Malala from Pakistan about how *young girls all over the world are being exploited by not being taken seriously and given voices*, and suffer from sexual exploitation and abuse. But this does not attract people who are addicted to messages of fiction about Comet Ping Pong and Pizza shop basements. What people in USA do not want to face is: Neil Postman was correct in year 1985, our media consumpton of fiction trash content is the problem, we are attracted to Fantasy Island private jets and Private Islands and rich men on the stage. Someone sincere like Bernie Sanders with thought-out and good ideas is treated the same way Malala has been treated since the release of her book October 8, 2013. Nonfiction is treated as boring. Climate change science, pandemic medical science, measles outbreak science, is treated as boring and grey-rocked like Malala. **Malala wants to adress the addiction to fiction, and Reddit society is not attracted to that topic. Pizzagate topic and Donald Trump Truth Social are fiction content, mythology, like the Quran.** ‚ÄúThe boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.‚Äù ‚Äï Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

Front page of Reddit, topics: fiction video game vs. real-life, adult going into a bar 

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : USA society can not distinguish reality from fiction. Nonfiction from fiction. And the kind of content that is popular in a bar, exciting thrilling stories, vs being serious about the threat the Donald Trump MAGA movement is. Reality is considered boring and unattractive, storytelling in a tavern to a style and tone of presentation - attractive. Everything is media ecology. [Donald Trump is King of Popularity](../../Grim_Blunt/Donald_Trump_SuperStar.md). This isn't just a young adult first time at a tavern, people in Florida The Villages where I have lived with my retired father before his death, were the same in year 2015 / 2016 / 2017 as MAGA was skyrocketing in popularity because it is a video screen game (like Oblivion in this Reddit posting). My father would play the MAGA fiction game via Fox News HDTV, not via a personal computer, but MAGA is still fiction-based content cosplay / attraction. Mythological. ===:::

Front Page of Reddit: Many deaths of Russians in the Ukraine war

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users are insulting and mocking Russia / Putin, just as they find Donald Trump a target to insult and mock. People do not discuss seriously: **why do the Russian people support Putin, and how to we all across the world of 8 billion people convince Ruissians otherwise?** You do not witness sociial media people seriously discussing how all war is bad in all places and how technology advancement of war is a threat to all humanity. There is a sense that without some place to mock and insult, life would be boring if there was no Russia / Putin to insult and punch down on as faiilures. People mock world peace as "whirled peas" jokes with mockery. So does Putin mock peace. Everyone is mocking peace and grey-rocking Malala's education and book. [Malala said in **early October 2013** that what was gong on with consevative Taliban coud very well be the style of dehumanization of World War Three. "13:25 Because you can-- you can stop war for a second, but you don't know it would start again or not. We have seen First World War, we have seen Second World War, and I think Third World War is coming; but I believe that we must stop it now. I don't want to see a Third World War in this world again. And the best way to fight against this war is education because, as we can see, the children are suffering from terrorism, they are suffering from child labor and child trafficking."](https://youtu.be/gjGL6YY6oMs?t=806)... she said this just months before the February 2014 invasion of Ukraine by Russia. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Read the comments on this news article (which is not a USA news source, but UK). USA society is complicity in the war against reality that [Peter Pomerantsev described in year 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/), Americans no longer assert reason thinking. We are living in as much Mythology as Quran and Mecca Palestine or Torah and Synagogue Israel media systems.

"It's also jerking by the ad exec who came up with the idea of an ad kind of subtly suggesting eugenics while maintaining plausible deniability. Predictable liberal outrage, predictable conservative mocking of liberal outrage, suddenly people remember that there is such a thing as american eagle jeans. In 10 years that ad exec is going to write a book about it."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : USA society normalized Edward Bernays techniques since 1920's, normalized Surkovian techniques since March 2013, normalized Donald Trump Twitter since year 2012. "Predictable liberal outrage, predictable conservative mocking of liberal outrage" - yes, *mob mentality*, treating Swat Valley Taliban conservative as equal choice to Malala since Octobe 8, 2013 on social media. These are not equal predictable. What's happening is technology of media keeps advancing, but human grasping of what Malala published in her Octobe 8, 2013 book is not advancing. Human beings are not keeping up with the media systems as Reddit users react-comemnt how "predictable" it all is - without a lick of media ecology self-awareness or ability to read a 1985 book from Neil Postamn. Just look at the Reddit username making the comment: "Nah,You're Wrong Bro!" - pure anti-intelectually tone and anti-book bullshit social media society values. Exactly what Neil Postman wrote about in 1985, Reddit user behaviors / Twitter thinking. "It's also jerking by the ad exec" - just *jerking* on what? Minds. It is manipulation and profitable and Reddit audience is like shooting fish in a barrel with the mentality that conservative Taliban in Swat Valley Pakstian is not a threat to humanity and that MAGA conervative is just routine. Super Hyper normalization in action. "kind of subtly suggesting" - is this entire comment astro-turf for the advertisement campign? There is ZERO subtle about this white supremacy theme.

"If they covered it accurately and thoroughly, then they wouldn't be able to write both sidesy articles that equivocate on how awful Trump is and give him so much unearned benefit of the doubt. And that's their favourite shit because it allows them to sell the reality TV version of events. This is a man who, as a civilian, was big upping China in a *titty magazine* as having shown "strength" for the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Of course he wants to brutalize everyday people with the military."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : this is an audience of meme consumers that grey-rocks Malala's October 8, 2013 book (not repeating and asserting on social media) while flocking to every shit that smells. The audience, voters, society of media consumers on electric media machines is the problem. Neil Postman in 1985 defines the problem of "sell the reality TV version of events"- and not a social media user wants to rescue Americans from this crisis by actually teaching Neil Postman's books. **Democracy does not work when the audience only wants fiction, only flocks to clickbait and Donald Trump Reality White House**. ===:::

"no ability to think beyond the 24 hour news cycle" - no ability to think beyond Twitter-length reaction comments, memes. Social media is the mainstream media, do you see people watching television in public or staring into smartphones? How asleep do you have to be to write a Twitter-length reply to all the problems of Reddit media ecology and not see Elon Musk purchasing Twitter? "beyond the 24 hour news cycle" - how long does Reddit keep postings on the front-page of /r/All - how long is the social media news cycle? 24 hours?

Junk garbage media consumption, consumers, audience, problem. Donald Trump is a symptom, people can't cite a single fact about how Russian information warfare actually works (the intended outcome, of reactionary low-effort media thinking). "The mainstream media these days has no ability to think beyond the 24 hour news cycle" - the problem is *profit and sell*, not *think*, the mainstream media is advertising blips, marketing, [exactly as Carl Sagan described mainstream media in year 1995 as 10-seconds or less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). ===:::

"fascism can't work is the media doesn't work for it. Yes, they were cynical about it and believed "it'd be easier to cover trump, than handle a biden speech on checks notes, " "rise of fascism?" lame! Yawn!

"The right also spent the last few years attacking mass media and calling it fake news.

They targeted a lot of their base where they already were: Facebook and Twitter.

Over and over they pumped out the same hate and fear and "blame the woke left" agenda, coupled with fear mongering (immigrants are taking our jobs, vaccines are bad, COVID wasn't real, etc) which slowly eroded their trust in media.

So, no, many didn't read Project 2025. By the time this was a thing the right had already eroded their trust and fed them a bunch of false narrative that the left lies, along with mainstream media.

If you watch some interviews with trump supporters it's quite clear there is a lack of critical thinking skills and an inability to do research for a range of opinions.

I watched someone close to me fall down this rabbit hole during COVID. It was fascinating and terrifying all at the same time."

"This right here would be the most significant thing to happen in trumps presidency yet. This would be basically our last chance to fight for our rights and freedom. Based on the response orange boy and the armed forces get they will know how far we can be pushed. Americans would need to do absolutely whatever needs to be done to combat and stop this. And yes, I mean the absolutely whatever needs to be done that you think I mean.

I am extremely studied in WW2 and Hitlers and the nazis path to absolute power over Germany. The transition from their paramilitary force the brownshirts to the SS was the start of when hitler got REALLY bold; doing whatever he wanted to Germans, as well as too his international neighbors. 

Appeasement and negotiations do not work when people/groups like trump and maga have the fervor that they do. Id bet you everything is got that hardline MAGAts view the political fight as an existential crisis. Germany did nothing but expand when Europe defended and retreated. Germany only lost ground when the allies stopped defending and started seeking out the fight."

"There are only two regimes, democracy and tyranny. Here are the methods of reducing democracy to tyranny. They are all against the Constitution.

Control of public information and opinion - It begins with withholding information, and leads to putting out false or misleading information. A government can develop ministries of propaganda under many guises. They typically call it "public information" or "marketing".

Vote fraud used to prevent the election of reformers - It doesn't matter which of the two major party candidates are elected if no real reformer can get nominated, and when news services start knowing the outcomes of elections before it is possible for them to know, then the votes are not being honestly counted.

Undue official influence on trials and juries - Nonrandom selection of jury panels, exclusion of those opposed to the law, exclusion of the jury from hearing argument on the law, exclusion of private prosecutors from access to the grand jury, and prevention of parties and their counsels from making effective arguments or challenging the government.

Usurpation of undelegated powers - This is usually done with popular support for solving some problem, or to redistribute wealth to the advantage of the supporters of the dominant faction, but it soon leads to the deprivation of rights of minorities and individuals.

Seeking a government monopoly on the capability and use of armed force - The first signs are efforts to register or restrict the possession and use of firearms, initially under the guise of "protecting" the public, which, when it actually results in increased crime, provides a basis for further disarmament efforts affecting more people and more weapons.

Militarization of law enforcement - Declaring a "war on crime" that becomes a war on civil liberties. Preparation of military forces for internal policing duties.

Infiltration and subversion of citizen groups that could be forces for reform - Internal spying and surveillance is the beginning. A sign is false prosecutions of their leaders.

Suppression of investigators and whistleblowers - When people who try to uncover high level wrongdoing are threatened, that is a sign the system is not only riddled with corruption, but that the corruption has passed the threshold into active tyranny.

Use of the law for competition suppression - It begins with the dominant faction winning support by paying off their supporters and suppressing their supporters' competitors, but leads to public officials themselves engaging in illegal activities and using the law to suppress independent competitors.

Subversion of internal checks and balances - This involves the appointment to key positions of persons who can be controlled by their sponsors, and who are then induced to do illegal things. The worst way in which this occurs is in the appointment of judges that will go along with unconstitutional acts by the other branches.

Creation of a class of officials who are above the law - This is indicated by dismissal of charges for wrongdoing against persons who are "following orders".

Increasing dependency of the people on government - The classic approach to domination of the people is to first take everything they have away from them, then make them compliant with the demands of the rulers to get anything back again.

Increasing public ignorance of their civic duties and reluctance to perform them - When the people avoid doing things like voting and serving in militias and juries, tyranny is not far behind.

Use of staged events to produce popular support - Acts of terrorism, blamed on political opponents, followed immediately with well-prepared proposals for increased powers and budgets for suppressive agencies. Sometimes called a Reichstag plot.

Conversion of rights into privileges - Requiring licenses and permits for doing things that the government does not have the delegated power to restrict, except by due process in which the burden of proof is on the petitioner.

Political correctness - Many if not most people are susceptible to being recruited to engage in repressive actions against disfavored views or behaviors, and led to pave the way for the dominance of tyrannical government.

Avoiding tyranny - The key is always to detect tendencies toward tyranny and suppress them before they go too far or become too firmly established. **The people must never acquiesce in any violation of the Constitution.** Failure to take corrective action early will only mean that more severe measures will have to be taken later, perhaps with the loss of life and the disruption of the society in ways from which recovery may take centuries.

Also I know I've seen this exact "MidasTouch topples Rogan" article months ago. It's why I looked them up in the first place. Seeing this exact same article pop up again with today's date seems fishy.

Personally I thought the podcasts were pretty low quality - very clickbaity and completely loaded with ads."

"I think both of you are correct. Weirdly it is brilliant cause they really do focus on stuff that one wishes Dem politicians would do. They also aren‚Äôt high quality as they are putting out a lot of content and it does hit you at social media speed. There is a ton of ads. I usually skip the first 3 mins of every episode and then find there is at least one other 3 min segment in a 15-20 min short. That‚Äôs kinda nuts for a podcast.

I very much like these guys still‚Ä¶ wish they didn‚Äôt so heavily optimize for money making. Most pods give you more for your time vs commercials."

"I‚Äôm vehemently anti-Trump, but I find the MeidasTouch published pieces to be over-the-top in titles and content, and I stopped watching after they developed a pattern of saying ‚Äúhe said XYZ,‚Äù then show the clip, in which he doesn‚Äôt explicitly say ‚ÄúXYZ,‚Äù and then they follow with ‚Äúas you can see - he said XYZ‚Äù

And they‚Äôll do ten minutes of talking head before showing the five second clip. If it‚Äôs that damning, show the clip up front and let it speak for itself.

Fox tactics for Dems? Great, it‚Äôs just more stupid in the end.

They weren‚Äôt like this before. Success twists."

Neil Postman was correct in 1985 when Ronald Regan **entertainer President** had been elected a second term in office. That was a decade before Fox News. This is about humanity globally, multiple NATO nations, and Fox News has been online since 1996. "they played by the rules of the game" - they did NOT play the Media Ecology game that Steve Bannon played with Cambridge Analytica, and Democrats did NOT beg every American to qutoe and quote and quote Christopher Wylie 2019 book (while Biden was in office!) on social media and podcasts **where it [calls out a trade-war](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md) in year 2019**. Nor did Democrats repeat repeating Matthew 6:5 verse to the face of the clergy [June 1, 2020 until November 7, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church) along with "1 John 3:17" about Trump - EVERYTHING IS MEDIA ECOLOGY in this Surkovian war! ===:::

"Fascism always has an in-group that is protected but not constrained and an out-group that is constrained but not protected. Fascists are never about actual freedom. That's just something they claim in bad faith to get in power. Also, they constantly shrink whose in the in-group because they need a constant enemy to motivate the people to keep them in power. That need for an enemy means someone who was secure in the in-group must now be vilified once the old "enemy" is defeated."
