"And most people don't care about others enough to do it. Either that, or our nation is too hyper-individualistic. You have to genuinely care about community to participate in a general strike, and that's not something our nation puts much stock in as a whole."

"This is not like Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with actual small claims disputes. The people involved sign contracts saying they’ll agree with whatever ruling the “Judge” makes. The show would then make the payouts instead of the parties involved in the case. People would agree because, guess what, 💰💰. The clip above however, is just some “actors” doing a skit in order to invoke the smooth brains into thinking they’ve witnessed some type of justice taking place. When, in actuality, they’ve essentially been conned. None of it’s real."

"After finding out that some college started doing social engineering experiments on Reddit posting shit like this I don't believe anything I read anymore."
