"And most people don't care about others enough to do it. Either that, or our nation is too hyper-individualistic. You have to genuinely care about community to participate in a general strike, and that's not something our nation puts much stock in as a whole."

"This is not like Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with actual small claims disputes. The people involved sign contracts saying they‚Äôll agree with whatever ruling the ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù makes. The show would then make the payouts instead of the parties involved in the case. People would agree because, guess what, üí∞üí∞. The clip above however, is just some ‚Äúactors‚Äù doing a skit in order to invoke the smooth brains into thinking they‚Äôve witnessed some type of justice taking place. When, in actuality, they‚Äôve essentially been conned. None of it‚Äôs real."

"Seriously, this whole thread feels like everyone's gone mad. What the hell is going on?

Did everyone get collectively dumber or something?"

"I've seen this argument a few times and it annoys me. I agree with you. Making a new account to ask advice was standard practice until apparently now it's dodgy and proof it's fake?"

"After finding out that some college started doing social engineering experiments on Reddit posting shit like this I don't believe anything I read anymore."

"He won because the media did nothing but stoke people‚Äôs feeling about high cost of living under Biden. That narrative disappeared as soon as Trump won. Liberal media is a myth."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Liberal mediais a myth", yes (nonfiction media is unpopular) .. but no, we are still free to choose in August 2025. Nonfiction media is still on the shelf, largely ignored. The crisis is global and we need to look outside the USA to see the patterns. [Fiction vs. nonfiction. Conservaties are attracted to fiction](Misc0/2025-07-29_conservatives_ethnic.md). Bluntly: people lack courage, bravery, balls to sustain repeating that the problem is *amusement entertainment* vs. nonfiction. People would rather spend time complaining about how terrible news is, hours each day complaining, than actually seek out books on media ecology and quote them. ===:::

"I hate to be like this, but i do agree. I dont care how many "self-report" surveys and puff piece interviews and hot takes i encounter about some sort of justified anxiety or anger - people will contort themselves anyway necessary and say anything to preserve their egos and image and justify the way they act. Trump is a sick symptom of a sick society that incentivizes selfishness, cynicism and self-righteousness at almost every turn."

"As I said the last time we talked about this during your last manic episode, I hope you are able to seek and receive treatment. Good luck to you."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This is political discourse in year 2025: Donald Trump had dementia, etc, etc. Thought-terminating behaviors. ===:::

"Are you fucking serious?

Conspiratorial thinking?

There's a real life conspiracy happening right now where a Russian asset is in the Whitehouse covering for an international pedophile ring.

I think a little conspiratorial thinking is warranted.

And yes, I have been building my own conspiracy you might say to combat it.

It's really not outlandish or unrealistic, especially if you knew my background, the family I come from, and the many friends I've made in life.

You clearly only want to discredit me though.

I have a feeling this isn't about my safety.

And I don't care what happens to me on my quest to save my country.

It's a rational decision many have made before to wager their life for the greater good, and a real chance at happiness."

"Do you believe people with mental health conditions are somehow unable to engage in intelligence activities just like anyone else?

Do you not see how my bipolar disorder could actually be an advantage in this process for me?

Just cause I have a mental health condition doesn't mean I haven't actually been busting my ass since day one on this."

"America does need a mass deportation event...

All these people from Trump all the way down to his stupidest, most vile backwater supporter need to be deported to Mars on an experimental Musk rocket.

I'm not American and not even on the same continent but at some point hearing about the utter garbage coming from that country, you start to question why these ~~people~~ animals are allowed to exist on the same planet and in the same society as normal, adjusted people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA society values: deport those you disagree with or do not grasp/understand (speak a different language, Spanish, etc). Dehumanizing people as "animals", saying that even animals do not have a right to exist on the planet, total domination dictatorship, even over elimination of entire species of animals. August 2025 USA thinking and [mass psychosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M). ===:::

"MAGA is a deadly symptom, but it's not the disease. Almost everything we're experiencing today started because of Reagan. It's uncanny how the average American's life has been on a downward trajectory since his presidency. Trump and MAGA are the final death throes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : In 1985, after witnessing the 1984 second term election of Ronald Reagan, a New York University professor of media ecology published a book about Twitter, Reddit, Fox News 1996 called "Amusing Ourselves To Death"... this book should be understood by every single American age 12 to 120 in August 2025, it is only 184 pages. ===:::

"Could be in the form of a nightmare for all of us years from now. I've been wondering for awhile if the first female president would be not a Democrat, but a Kristi Noem or an MTG ...e.g, a repub female ...not a Democratic one. Maga's love 'em them politics-Barbies."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Even Ivanka Trump as a figurehead, with others doing most of the work. Ivanka could choose to have less of a media prescence, or behave just like Donald on media, a complete freedom. The key thing is exploiting the "no female is electable" expectation with a MAGA supporter, to empahsize that Hillary Clinton was just a terrible choice (despite her Secretary of State experience and statements about ["Information War" in early 2011 against Putin/Russia](https://communicationleadership.usc.edu/2011/03/06/secretary-clinton-and-the-information-war/). Could you imaagine Ivanka running on a slogan of "my father made some mistakes, I will fix them"? ===:::
