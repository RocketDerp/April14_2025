"It was because the democrats failed to protect and ultimately save the democracy and the people the democrats serve didn't give a shit and forgot about it. Biden refused to push Garland to make a decision before it was too late and now it's obvious he was worrking with the trump people. All of these court cases that got delayed and such turned out to have been done so because they were soft on or sympathetic towards Trump, thus making it impossible to prosecute him. The problem is that we have institutionalists and it was obvious as far as Biden's win that Trump was going to continue being a power while Biden and the Democrats remained institutionalists. The people of the US preferred to forget, so this became something of no priority which was proven by just a couple days of online outrage when they were pardoned.

If, by any chance, the Dems win 2026 and 2028, which is seemingly impossible, they will not clear the government and the country of the treasonous rot, thus leaving the way open for another in Trump's family to run. The problem also is that what Trump has done to the country will be a generational repair operation. There's no way the people will keep the democrats on long enough to oversee it and with all these terrorists still in the government, it's just going to happen again.

At this point I'm in favor of the US breaking up so russia has less of a cohesive satellite state which is what the US effectively is right now."

"It's not just a feeling. The military parade in China, and especially the words of Xi, could very well mark the formal start of WW3.

It's basically NATO(Allies) vs The Axis...again. And they are already at war, with Ukraine being used as a proxy.

The issue is that Russia and China fired the first shots more than a decade ago, when they filled Western society with propaganda and misinformation (and we allowed it). They were so effective that they managed to install a puppet regime in the US, throwing all NATO allies into chaos.

There's no easy way out now, and I believe that's the real reason for the parade...they think they won. And honestly, if you look at the chaotic state of Western society, I would say they did. Hopefully, I'm mistaken."

The wealthy and powerful have been honing their playbooks to inflame their Konfederacy of Kooks: the uber-religious, the anti-vaxers, Christian nationalists, isolationists, racists and gun nuts (I've probably missed a few). All of those groups are essentially single issue, and will vote in lockstep with whatever party addresses their concerns.

What's also obvious is that none of those groups have any concerns that will actually affect the truly wealthy and powerful of this country. Does anyone actually think that the Thiels/Murdochs/Trumps/Kochs/Mercers of this country are going to let one of us poors open carry a gun in their presence, that those families are going to stop vaccinating their kids, or that they give a fuck about paper coffee cups?

"Ok, respectfully, I get the desire to embellish; but 'enormous' is not the word that comes to mind when I watch the video. They took over maybe a city block, if that? Access to Trump Tower was not impugned in any real way. The numbers weren't particularly staggering. And...everyone will think I'm criticizing the protestors. I'm not. I'm criticizing the headline.

We, as a people, are exhausted by embellished sensationalized headlines that call us to action while presenting an image of media clip that presents a starkly different picture to what's being projected in the wording. This discredits and diminishes any attached movement, because it makes the movement seem, in the uninformed viewer's eyes, desperate for attention.

Essentially: You have called my attention to this event; and presented it as a large, substantive incident; when in reality it is no more or less then the hundreds and thousands of moderately sized protests I have already seen. You got my hope up that finally action was being taken; and the absence of that in reality, reminded me of the deficit of energy that we seem to be suffering. You have wasted my time, you have wasted my energy; and you made the movement seem desperate and inadequate.

I understand you have to write eye catching headline; it's your job. But don't rely on explosive wording to do it. It would have been a much better headline to say, "Protests across the nation against the Trump Regime ongoing. The latest has occurred in front of Trump Tower; and is the most recent indication that the movement is gathering steam."

Even better would have been to do some actual reporting; and finding out if there's any cross philosophy agitation involved; are there a handful of former Red Hats? If so, what motivated them to change perspective. What's the common ground? What are the issues?

But hey. What can you do. We should have buried tabloid journalism when we had the chance. Instead of allowing an unnecessary unholy union of information and entertainment."

"They're not even complicit, the media is *the* reason politics has devolved so much so quickly. News outlets chasing clicks spin headlines to drive outrage-based engagement because that's where the money is, so self centered politicians start using rhetoric that's easy to write those same sorts of headlines about, and it just goes round and round until we end up with state sponsored media writing hit pieces on whoever's against their biggest money makers because they know it sells.

There's no such thing as journalistic integrity when a news org is for profit, and everything wrong with the US currently (and world politics to a lesser degree) can be traced back to the media and their silver tongued pundits."

Neil Postman's 1985 book explains this as best as can be done in a short 1984 page book. The addiction to clickbait and addiction to egoism filter-bubbles has taken over society.

"But it’s not just Fox anymore…. There are so many networks, and then you get into the real meat: YouTube and podcasts. There are simply not enough boomers to keep this going. They needed young people, and they used modern platforms to get a message out that resonated with them. It’s terrifying, and it happened in Germany leading up to the 2nd world war.

But when you called them Nazis, for YEARS, voices on the right AND the left called you an alarmist. The left slept through this. They pandered to minorities without offering a plan to make their lives better. They championed issues that impacted less than 3% of the electorate while not telling the lower class as a whole how they will be moving to a new middle class within 10 years. Nothing.

Fox enables all of this, and they are MAGA heroin for sure. But that makes social media MAGA meth, and the red hats have mastered social media in the same way the left figured out the 24 hour news cycle first in the early 90s. And the lefts lack of effective leadership is doing the red hats every favor in the world.

If there was a party trying to let a dictator take over, the Dems are doing a fantastic job fitting that mold. They won’t emulate an opposition party, aren’t providing plans that people can easily understand and sell to others, so what the fuck are they doing? In 2025 I give the democrats the MAGA MVP award. Hopefully shit changes fast."

"That's because, just like Wakanda, the "America" that you saw was a fictional creation based on the media's portrayal of America. People in AMERICA believe that the REAL America is somewhere else out there, somewhere nice and clean and fancy, where everyone's happy and life is fairly easy.

Not in THEIR town of course but somewhere.

It's part of where the anger and entitlement particularly of less educated/traveled people in the USA is coming from, the concept of "relative poverty" is important in psychology....if you have a perfectly nice and nutritious meal, but everyone else around you is having something fancier to eat, suddenly your nice nutritious meal may seem like garbage to you because everyone else is having something nicer.

Which is stupid, okay, but that's how our minds work.

People with an education who have travelled around a bit understand that the USA is not what the media makes it appear to be, and so they're not as bothered by the idea of relative poverty.

But people who do NOT have that experience see their adequate lives in their town as being RELATIVELY garbage because they're comparing their life situation to Wakanda, basically, and they're mad that they will never get a chance to go live there. And they get even MORE mad when anyone tries to make changes that would actually make their lives better, because they already believe that so many other people have lives so much better than theirs, and political figures have taken advantage of that to push the idea that it will get worse if we do anything like, say, health care for all.

They literally don't understand it's not real and that damn near everything they think they know is a lie."
