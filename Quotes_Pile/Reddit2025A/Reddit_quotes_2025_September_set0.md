"This is Reddit. We don't do sources here."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Was one of the big changes in Reddit long-form comment culture when the Putin media invasion started in year 2013. People became far more concerned about insulting and mocking other people than educating and teaching - providing links and citations - that the Google search engine could hit upon topics and keywords. Even if the person you were directly replying to in public discourse didn't care about the link, 7 years later on Reddit a search engine hit could bring people to the old conversation. That media ecology self-awareness started to boil off in the out-group hate heat the IRA induced. ===:::

"Me too. Damn that’s sad I had to learn from a meme."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction content consumers get incredibly sad when a very old man, age 89, dies. A person they do not know except through film and television content. The same younger film media / movie media fiction addicts (Robert Redford context) **can not relate how fiction addicts to Charlie Kirk content (podcasts) being killed shockingly in public while speaking at a University has induced media mania in audience members**. There is a complete lack of comprehension of media ecology and how emotion (["heart strings" metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s)) are pulled and manipulated by wealth content holders / copyright holders. And who pulls such heart strings. The film industry cartels / musi industry cartels / video game characer cartels / who manipulate audiences to build massive wealth / social emdia fiction content cartels (Reddit, Facebook, Elon Musk Twitter) do it even mroe personalized since year 2013 using Cambridge Analtyica and Kremlin techniques.

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?”

"The Russians could disappear into thin air and it would probably still take months for Ukraine to recapture the country.

Millions of landmines, anti-personnel traps, ditches, trenches, nets, tank traps, razor wire, poisoned wells, booby trapped houses and dugouts, caltrops, and many other horrible things stand between Ukraine and any hope of normalcy.

Dealing with those things will last decades after the last Russian gets turned into fertilizer."

"I agree, the headline is certainly a bit extreme.

To be as generous as possible to it, what I would say is that, on a larger scheme, the Russian offensive to take Pokrovsk has largely culminated. The disaster for Russia that was the “breakthrough” from a few weeks ago north of the city has really resulted in a major kneecapping of the already weakening push.

When you add to that Ukraine’s effective striking at logistics and assets that were recently diverted to the Pokrovsk offensive, it really points to the fact Russia is in trouble.

That also ignores the trouble brewing in the Sumy region for Russia as well with Ukraine now making flanking strikes into Russia itself at this point. Normally you’d think such a situation would warrant more assets, but we’re hearing that Russia is sending troops AWAY from Sumy and towards supporting the Pokrovsk offensive.

I think soon enough we may see the first month of more Ukrainian gains than Russian gains in a long time, and it won’t be due to a sudden massive rout. Ukraine is learning how to effectively clear out Russians, and Russia is rapidly losing the ability to maneuver cleanly and safely with the amount of armor lost."

"This has nothing to do with sanctions. Sanctions are showing their effect, but elsewhere.

This is caused by Russians overextending in a thin strip of land surrounded by Ukrainian forces on all sides, betting they won’t have the manpower to counter attack, somehow forgetting this is the most densely manned part of the front."

"Not for pratically free unlike Ukraine. Russia has to pay China now for what they buy, at a premium as dodging sanctions and keeping things discrete tend to make a product more expensive.

Ukraine can run a Lend Lease tab and pay in decades after the conflict ends.

Or more recently they buy from US and the EU pays the bill.

The EU alone can outspend Russia by a large margin. Defense budgets are not even at 2%, NATO has not even entered the fight and Russia has been effectivelly stopped dead in its tracks with 1M casualties already."

"That college really seems cursed. Taught there for 14 years. By the end, so many crazy things had happened, on-campus shooting perpetrated by an instructor on a professor then the instructor shooting himself dead the same day (and no report released on what even really happened), terrible car accident killing an education professor, the murder of a music professor by a stepson. A feckless, vindictive, stupid asshole of a maniac president (Bill Laforge) who built himself a palace of a home from alumni money and took the school into financial disaster after a post-COVID downturn in enrollment. A chair of a division letching on his female students. Hiring an unqualified con man life coach dean. Another dean going off the deep end and confining an instructor physically in his office.

“Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology.

“Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

“If all information is seen as part of a war, out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy.

"The right is very sensitive even though they pretend the left is the sensitive ones" is out-grup hate patterns. Both groups are correct that human minds are extremel sensitive (all people, over 8 billion on earth) to their favorite media format / media venues / media seasoning / media flavoring / media tone / media storytelling regarding fiction addictions. Thinking that all human behavior is "left or right" is a horrible way of interpreting media ecology and human behaviors.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Bible is science fiction, Quran is science fiction, Torah is science fiction. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Donald Trump Truth Social provides fiction that audiences desire. We are now a fiction-driven society like Saudi Arabia with Mecca, like Putin's Russia with Surkov techniques. Fiction storytelling techniques attract media addict American population (We The People). The rise of the Streaming Media age (creation and popularity of Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube, Joe Rogan podcasts, etc) is the rise of fiction addictions. No longer do peoople have to wait for the cinema to open, or only get the move cable TV HBO offers on a schedule, it is a filter-bubble of egoism non-stop choose as you wish. And people choose: Hate Trump, Mocky Trump. The endless insporation of Truth Social values / Twitter values of 24 hour a day hate messages and mockery, fiction content, self-harm manipulation. That's what Trump provides for everyone, a person to insult and mock. A total population of 341 million people who prize and value hate messages and mockery of pople they disagree with, egomania self-harm. We could all unite and learn about Russian informationw warfare that streamed over the Internet since March 2013, but that is nonfiction, that is real reality. Nonfiction is not popular, nonfiction does not sell. Neil Postman's 40 books are ignored.. because nonfiction was left beyond in favor of Truth Social leadership of fiction. Trump himself sells and markets fition Bible books. ===:::

For that matter, the government should not be able to stop anything through action. As it is a direct violation of the First Amendment for the government to do that. Even if the speech is in poor taste."

"my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act. Surkov himself is the ultimate expression of this psychology." ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, 2014

"I think you’ve been honest because I know someone like this. He would openly tell you he used to be a republican… of the Nixon school! lol I held the laughter because Nixon is way before my time and aside from his impeachment I don’t know what he stood for. I encouraged the old man to let it all out.

Anyways he proclaimed he’s anti-everything, anti big government, anti religion specially, anti administrations and bureaucracy, anti establishment, an atheist, and one of the true libertarians. You can see how being a true hard core atheist he would have a problem with this Christian evangelical fanatism or fascism.

I found him slightly amusing in an “old man yells at clouds” kind of way. He is repulsed by MAGA, but too set in his ways to change parties I think. I cannot see him supporting social programs, though he benefits from them as he’s 82 and on Medicare, social security, etc. These people are sometimes quite contradictory. I think he’s one of those disaffected independents. Sometimes when I am puzzled by these kinds of voter I remember that old man.

Good on you for actually voting for the opposite party."

I’m not surprised that this administration is lying about Kirk’s death to spread their agenda, but it’s deeply disturbing that they’re spreading such thinly veiled calls for war against Democrats simply because they’re questioning Kirk’s own highly problematic statements.

"I’d argue it’s a little more complicated than that. Part of it is targeting college-aged kids to focus on the next generation of Republicans (a scary thought), but it’s also eroding public trust in higher education. Republicans are pushing the idea that colleges indoctrinate students into believing liberal ideas, so having someone “debate” college students makes Republicans believe that colleges students aren’t actually smart and college is failing to teach students real facts. The truth is educated people are more likely to lean left because college teaches students to think reasonably and better distinguish between fact and fiction. It also helps that college forces students to experience new cultures and lifestyles that they might never have seen before. I grew up conservative but became more liberal after having black, gay, and Indian roommates in college that helped me realize my small town wasn’t the entire world."

People are behaving anti-book (nonfiction) entertainment addicts who can't face their own Trump addiciton to mockery and hate magnet Trump. People can't see how Donald Trump on Truth Social has set the standard of citation and bar for measuring nonfiction to all bullsht and fiction. ===:::

Russian influence enabled the extreme media coverage (making things seem worse, etc.) that is now being used by US media as it has been shown to work for ads, etc. so the Russian seeds have worked.

There was real evidence for influence in 2016:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear - "Russian cyber espionage group. American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has stated with a medium level of confidence that it is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency"

https://nationalpost.com/news/world/a-russian-troll-farms-most-viewed-facebook-ad-wasnt-about-trump-it-promoted-u-s-law-enforcement - this is interesting. It's Russian troll farms pretending to fight each other online "left v right", etc.

https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/media/blacktivist-russia-facebook-twitter/index.html - same as above but with black rights.

This has only gotten worse and will continue to do so."

"This is what a lot of people don't realize. These countries (much like our own) have entire teams/programs dedicated to Psychological Operations. They study and have plenty of data on what is considered contentious subjects. Race, political affiliations all these things just waiting to be exploited. 

And those that fall into these false narritives about race and political identities becoming part of you own personal identity... You are playing right into the hands of foreign adversaries.

Furthermore, particularly on the political front... Politicians are not representing you - left or right - they are representing their own monetary interests. Do you know of a congressperson or someone who has been president thats not a multimillionaire? So tread with caution before you start fighting IRL or virtually online for any higher office people. Look at their actions, not their words and be smart. Don't fall into herd mentality. It's a trap no matter what side you are on.

Plenty of other more fruitful places to 'belong'."

"Europe has failed to realise fascism wasn't a fad of the nazis it's a human quality.

Oldest I can find of violent authritarianism through establishment of an underclass whose purpose is to be lesser and persecuted is ancient Sumeria who hated women. The Romans did it, the Catholic church did it, the British did it and the Nazis did it. This isn't new.

Yet we have sat here and allowed fascists to incite hatred and develop a platform despite the fact that these people are the most deadly issue humanity has ever faced bar literal disease.

This is a fundamental failure of democracy and is tantamount to institutional suicide. Fascists should be stripped of their media presences and their vote because 70% of the population shouldn't be persecuted and executed because 30% is hateful and insane.

Keir Starmer and populist panderers have fundamentally failed as human beings. These fascists will kill anyone who stands against them if it is "acceptable" and so we must prevent their interference at all costs. No rights beneath my rights."

"Quite literally. The middle class was a marketing exercise to stop the working classes doing what they did in the soviet union, which they were very close to after ww2. The enlightened among the wealthy realized they couldn't resort to the brutal tactics they had previously relied on to suppress what was now a trained fighting force, united, and willing to die. And the soviet unoin would rapidly back any successful working class movements in the west. It was a dangerous time to be as greedy as they had always been, so they gave a little back, to convince the working classes, there was actually a model of capitalism which benefited them.

Now they have completely destroyed working class cohension, the soviet union, and divided the population into a million factions fighting over absolute nonsense, rather than their common interests, they are rolling things back to how they always were, maximum work in exchange for the literal minimum necessary to keep you alive to come back to work."

"Not just that but literally top headline. I peak over at the conservative subreddit once in a while to see how crazy things are, it’s just wall to wall that story. They just can’t help themselves, any whiff of the word trans and it’s like piranhas to blood in the water.

It can’t just be a crazy terminally online troll with mental health issues who got pushed over the edge by hateful rhetoric. Can’t be the actions of an individual. Has to be some left wing conspiracy, everyone who doesn’t love Trump wants them dead because they have different opinions.

And then you see them saying conservatives are better critical thinkers, they don’t get radicalized as easily, don’t live in pecho chambers like the left, don’t get violent.

It really does feel like we’re finally reaping the rewards of several decades of rampant anti-intellectualism."

"Part of the problem is that disinformation has become so normalized and pervasive that those influenced by Fox News, the GOP, and other right-wing personalities are utterly convinced of their own correctness. It is cognitively impossible, for many of them, to recognize that they are wrong and that the figures they support embody the opposite of the values they claim to champion.

What we are witnessing is a profound erosion of critical thinking, a phenomenon that social media has amplified and that opportunistic actors have deliberately exploited. The warning signs were present years ago: numerous mass shooters were found to have engaged with fringe extremist communities online. These groups succeed by fostering belonging, portraying their members as embattled minorities, and convincing them they are under existential threat.

Scaled up, the same tactics now affect millions of ordinary Americans who sincerely believe they are dismantling a “deep state” and restoring democracy. In reality, their actions serve to undermine the very democratic institutions they think they are defending.

At least, that’s my take on it."

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

And in response to his on the record quotes of it just being necessary for some people to die to gun violence: "That's not what he meant! He meant it was sad and unfortunate but couldn't be avoided! More people die in cars every year, should we ban all cars???" In addition to car and gun deaths being a nonsensical comparison between apples and potatoes, it's also a complete red herring meant to do nothing more than pull you away from the fact that he was an absolutely vile person that advocated for children to die to gun violence, as long as they weren't his children, of course, in order to stoke the support of right wing gun fetishists.

Just like all of his utterly fake "change my mind" debates, it has been crafted to push a narrative that to a noncritical thinker looks perfectly rational. But it's all fake, it's all a facade, it's all for show."

nazis devised the global jewish conspiracy that went the same way. jews were always to blame somehow, some way. it didn’t matter who they were imor what they did. every foul thing was their fault somehow and it wasn’t ever about reality or fact or objectivity; it was about blaming jews and eventually killing then."

I do not see people declaring we need to love one another, love mother earth, Woodstock 1969 was heading in the right direction with messages.

"This is the problem facing America; the far-right views the center and so-called "left" with equal conviction and belief that they're the problem. All while completely ignoring their own very actions, by leaders and talking heads, and by their own fellow MAGA everytime violence occurs. They only accept as facts and truth the things that reaffirm their already held beliefs. They only believe that which paints the "left" in a poor light, and anything that makes MAGA look bad is hand waived away as fake news, witch hunt, deep state lies.

These are not mentally well people, and I sadly do not know how we come back from this before things get much much worse. At the very least it would require an actual leader in power that cares about healing the country, one with tact, grace, intelligence and emotional/general intelligence. Instead we have another mentally unwell man child with clear traits of malignant narcissism who will stop at nothing to get revenge on his perceived enemies (you are NOT to try and hold him to account for his crimes, because they're all made up to hurt him. Otherwise they will accuse you of the same thing and lessen the meaning of justice and his own wrongs). Just like Miller using "insurrectionists" here, or Trump going after people for "mortgage fraud", ya know, the exact same thing he was convicted of. It's saddening and frustrating beyond belief to sit back and watch America burn because an entire political group has been proagandized to about only being to trust the media that lies to them. It's a crazy world we're in and honestly I'm exhausted by just how dumb it all really is, and how easily half of America is leading us all off a cliff, only to whine about "Dems, LGBTQ, "woke" destroying America.

Just like with the trans boogeyman they've all been hammering on social media and in the news after the one of many school shootings recently. No amount of facts, hard proof and data is going to make them change their tone and admit that trans mass shooters are few and far between, but they aren't going to let that keep them from acting like nearly all mass shootings are trans. They'll ignore the fact that men account for over 95% of shootings and over 55% are White Men, but sure let's focus on the less than 1% to blame for this. They started the propaganda immediately with Kirks death, calling for violence against the "left" and going to "war" (Fox News has made everything a war against poor victim conservatives since the '90s, but sure, they're not to blame for the divide in America AT ALL).

It's like a mass mental illness, and that is making everyone unwell dealing with their constant gaslighting, projecting, lying, etc. Something has to give ON THE RIGHT or this country is headed for self-destruction."

"Someone said it on here earlier…

“Fuck your feelings” is soooo much easier to give than to receive. And for a man they clearly worshipped who hated empathy they sure expect a boatload of it now. The idea behind “being better” is to learn from stuff like this and not doubling down on the hate filled ideas and rhetoric. It is early but what are his followers doing? Calling for war? Hating anyone on the left? Calling this the Reichstag Fire moment - which is confusing because that would mean they agree it was an inside job, right?

Personally, I’m struggling to feel anything other than indifferent. He died doing what he loved - being hateful and divisive - so shouldn’t we all be so lucky? Instead of, I don’t know, dying in a mass shooting or because of some disease we eradicated decades ago they are determined to revive through ending vaccinations?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media addicts of Reddit / Bluesky / Twitter / Facebook, addicted to Russian fiction and hate messaging, will die doing what they love: worshiping touchscreen media devices of fiction and abandoning climate change, science reality, medical science in favor of mocking figureheads like RFK Jr / Trump over and over. This has gone on for OVER TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, endless nonstop mocking the Donald Trump performance of Tony Clifton antics. Surkov won, Russia won the meme war to make Americans addicted to natics and fiction, avoidant of nonfiction. ===:::

Avoidance of ever mentioning the "Internet Research Agency" and avoidance of mentioning Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News audience branwashing (nonfiction film). Avoidance of declaring we have runaway media addiction problems and that Donald Trump and many around him seem entirely addicted to paterns of Kremlin information. Instead, a constant sustained focus on magical private jet sex acts / "Epstein" / Pizzagate / QAnon level fiction. Instead of claling for science-based comprehension and understanding of reality, people are calling for a magical wildcard "list" of Epstein... which will just lead to more and more calling for more and more rich white men sex lives information. Meanwhile, women being given a voice like Malala's efforts globaly (not just domestic USA) are ignored and avoided. Girls are not empired, but nonstop focus on magical sex acts of rich old white elder rules (just like the Taliban in Swat Valley, Pakistain dicating to little girls like Malala and nobody wanting to hear the girls voices on the subject of sexaul domination by male elders). How does one describe that Pizzagate style addiciton to white men sex lives is driving the entire Epstein stopic engagement? While Canada is being attacked in anti-NATO pro-Russia fashion in 2025? ====:::

I don't see people supporting Malala's education movement since she published her book in October 2013. What "high road" are people taking towards world peace and right-wing Taliban?  What most Reddit meme addicts mean by "high road" isn't anything close to education / teachg / comprehension / understanding of human mob mentality and information warfare problems / how billionares manipulate audiences. A "high raod" would be using Reddit to promtoe every single day, every 12 hours for years, Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News and hate-based right-wing media. I dn't see anyone using social media to promote that "high road", but I see social media fiction content addicts promoting action media content of shootings captured on video.  People who want more action, entertainment, hyper reality out of their society and prize Donald Trump's antics and nonsense to constantly mock and insult on media machines.

Either you're somebody we can have a conversation with, or you're a dangerous lunatic who infringed on our society that we must be rid of as soon as possible.

He explained he is anti-Russia but could understand this justification, at least.

Part of the solution, as I see it, is to unplug. Stop watching TV. This is why they're actively attacking unbiased sources like NPR and other public news sources. "Liberal bias" is such a scam.

"The simple fact is Putin and Russia are just evil and the fact that you don’t see large scale protests in Russia against Russia’s unprovoked invasion is not because Russians are in fear of Putin’s SS, it’s because the average Russian is perfectly fine with exterminating Ukraine and any other country or race Putin puts up on the pedestal as the “enemy of Russia”

The sooner we accept this harsh truth the sooner we can admit the only way this war can end is if the ordinary Russian citizen is made to know terror just as the Germans and Japanese were so they beg their government to stop the war"

"if the ordinary Russian citizen is made to know terror" - oh, so if the ordinary Israel person is made to known terror on the morning of October 7, 2023 - then Palestine will solve the problem! Faith in terrorism being messaged on dehumanizing machines of Reddit. Fatih in murdering humans. "The simple fact" - everything is very very very simple messaging on Reddit. Murder and terrorize the everyday people of Russia! Teach them that war and terrorism is the answer to pass down to their children. ===:::

"These people navigate their lives by social proof and mindless consumerism, and they absolutely need a media caricature of a righteous power daddy to tell them what to do, think, and feel. We live in an age of media zombies. These people live in a top-down, paternalistic hyperreal fever dream, and would trust the reality TV guy over their own dear little granny or next door neighbor. Nothing is real unless it is on TV, and their [Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) reinforces that the wealthy and powerful can do no wrong.

Southern Redeemers and Confederate propagandists won the cultural Civil War over the course of the 20th century. We are living in a country in which the Yankee ideal of liberty and rule of law has been defeated. These paleo-conservatives are not only taking us back to a time before the American Revolution, they want to erase the Enlightenment from history all together.

While the rest of the country was becoming a modern pluralistic democracy from the 1870s to the 1960s, the South was inventing the modern idea of apartheid. When Trump and modern Republicans speak of "retribution," they are talking about taking revenge on the rest of us who believe in democracy and universal suffrage. They are still mad about Reconstruction (which failed within 10 years anyway), Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights era, and the Voting Rights Act (which they already dismantled). We are entering a new "reconstruction" in which people of Southern worldview are the new "carpetbaggers" imposing their ideal of apartheid and white slave power oligarchy on the rest of the country.

Reconstruction failed and Southern Redeemers were allowed to take hold of the media over the course of the 20th century, and here we are. The Right always talks about a mythical "woke" leftwing Hollywood, because historically the exact opposite is true. From The Birth of a Nation which developed many of the modern Hollywood cinematography techniques, to Gone with the Wind, to the Hollywood Blacklist, John Wayne and Roy Rogers' "cowboy frontier thesis mythology" which Ronald Reagan effectively weaponized in his fascist rise to power, to reality television and the rise of Donald Trump. The media is built around placating the sensibilities of Southern teenagers. The rest of us never had a chance."

There are issues going on in this country that are not partisan issues, but those in power keep making them partisan issues to keep the people divided, because if the people actually united the the people in power would actually pay for their crimes and have to answer to the people they're supposed to be working for not against .

Alas, people do indeed do this, and find that the audience is addicted to left vs. right one-bit logic thinking.

"there hasn’t been a strong Democratic competitor since Obama" - which is declaring that Donald Trump is a great competititor. Trump selling fiction, Donald Trump and Fox News sell fiction.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Donald Trump media empires are catoring to the fiction addicts of television and video games. The video game GTA 6 setting is the fictional U.S. state of Leonida, which is based on Florida, and features the iconic Miami-inspired city of Vice City. Drug lords and dramatic warlord / cartel entertainment audiences. Russian Surkov entertinment-based leadership. ===:::

"Too many people weren't paying attention.

Too many people believed the lies he was telling, or at least gave them far more weight than they'd proved deserving of.

Too many people ignored the warnings, acted like Democrats and others were just being hyperbolic or sensational, "crying wolf" etc.

Trump is the culmination of long-standing Republican efforts to drag discourse into the mud, to turn everything into a politicized mess, so they can say or do anything and people will just make it into an equal issue, no matter how bad/awful/criminal/horrific the Republican position is."

"That's what is so bewildering about conservatives in general - they are on the wrong side of every single issue, almost reflexively. They have developed such a hatred of empathy and education that they now just take whatever the wrong position is and stay there to spite the other side. Vaccines? Equal rights? Climate change? For fucks sake, these people are on the side of big game trophy hunters and pedophiles and against food stamps and higher wages lol."

No other leader can provide the fiction storytelling like Donald Trump to meme addict society. Middle East / Levant values of Torah fiction / Quan fiction / Bible fiction.

Anyone who cannot see Trump is a pedophile is choosing to ignore the overwhelming evidence because of their own agenda (either a pedophile themselves or racist willing give power to a pedophile because he hurt minorities).

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : QUESTION: "When did empathy become so polarizing?"
ANSWER: Joseph Campbell lessons for Star Wars audiences filmed by George Lucas in summer of 1986: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. **The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile” — the person is not of the same order." (see also Islamic "infidel", Christian "non-believer" terms to match up "gentile") ===:::

"I believe you’re correct, but I’m also afraid I’m fooling myself. The things he’s already gotten away with are outrageous to the point that I never would have believed it. If you told me in 2016 that this is the state that America would be in now… the end of the rule of law, the huge drop in ethics and morality, the increasingly state controlled media and the lies, my god the lies!! The war on science. If you would have told me all this was possible in America I would have dismissed you as a crazy conspiracy theorist, I’d have bet everything I have that this scenario is not possible. But here we are and I think I have trauma from it. I’ve lost my confidence in what is possible or not and I have no idea how this is all going to turn out. I think many MAGA including Trump are actually okay with a civil war and it’s so thoroughly disturbing. It seems like he might be finally hitting some roadblocks in his agenda with recent court rulings and finally getting some pushback. I hope you’re right! And I hope we get past this and learn and change some laws to prevent this type of power grab in the future."

"The problem is that people forget he's a showman.

He may suck at being president, but when it comes to manipulation he's a pro. He's obviously not declaring war because there already would have been tanks and jets flying over that city the government doesn't announce invasions. He's just doing this because of "ratings".

"I watch Parkergetajob on YouTube, and his whole schtick is having folks debate him about why they support Trump. what I've learned watching his channel is that most Trumpers do not understand what a source is - they will frequently make a confident statement, and, when pressed about why they think that's true, they will usually say that they just think it's true. no laws referenced, no executive orders mentioned, just that they're happy Trump is fixing America based off vibes and social media posts.

the most consistent weird thing is that they all "don't agree with everything he does," so they can totally ignore the rape and child trafficking and sexualization of his own daughter and all the other weird or criminal shit, yet, they all believe in their own flavor of Trump who has done imaginary things that they're thrilled about, despite there being no proof about any of it.

like, just yesterday, there was a guy claiming that Trump has ended six wars. when pressed on it, he very confidently mentioned that one of the conflicts Trump ended was the situation in Gaza. this dude - as of yesterday, September 6th, 2025 - said that "it's not even a thing anymore" and that the region has been under a ceasefire since Trump stepped in. when and where did Trump step in? when did he step in? totally unclear. when it was brought up that there was a double-tap explosive attack on a hospital with a bunch of journalists in it just a few days ago, well, actually, nuh-uh.

I have no doubt that most of these people would be institutionalized if we were still doing that shit."

Her first response was not what I thought it was going to be. Even a little bit. When she said "I cannot wait for all--" my brain finished it with "my friends and family to hear the news" because surely she was happy about this? Absurdly so but that is the emotion I was expecting. Nope.

"...for all you blue people" even here I still thought she was going to show the emotion we call happy, maybe a bit of unbecoming smugness, but happiness all the same. "..TO BE PISSED ABOUT IT!"

"I think the mass delusion of what I call “digital adjacency” is very real and very dangerous. Partially due to social engineering and partially due to his weird “authentic” voice, Trump successfully leveraged Facebook and Twitter to propel him to the White House in 2015. People really believed he was “speaking to them,” “telling it like is,” “talking like them.”

Somehow, he continues to mainline his presence into a frightening number of American households via Truth Social - often hourly - employing virtually the same schtick from ten years ago. The dopamine hit MAGA voters feel when they receive a push notification from Donald Trump should never be underestimated. Many of them believe he has a personal relationship with them. Think about the percentage of text messages an average MAGA voter receives on a daily, weekly, yearly basis from Donald J. Trump. Compare that to the number they receive, or don’t, from the other people in their lives.

If we make out of this second term with some semblance of our democracy intact, this decade-and-a-half is going to confound historians for the next 200 years."

"And what do you do? It's seriously like a religion. There is no argument against it. A group of people support him because he said so. That's it. You can't convince any of them otherwise because he is right and anyone who doesn't believe him is wrong. End of story. Their lives literally need to crumble, they need to lose everything, they need to see everything they've ever hoped for completely fall apart and then maybe, a strong maybe, some of them will come to the realization but I'm convinced they would all follow him to their dying breaths.

The lack of education is the other MAJOR factor along with everything you said. Listen to how he speaks. He has the vocabulary of a 3rd grader and the solutions to problems of one too. He speaks in a way they can all understand and his solutions to anything are so simple minded that they make sense to anyone who lacks actual problem solving skills and critical thinking. Ask a 3rd grader how to fix something and they'll give you a solution that would never even come close to working and they'll tell you confidently because on a basic level it seems obvious to them. That's as far as these people can think and they shout it from the rooftops as if everyone else is just blind to it.

It's not just that they feel like there's some special connection, everything he says and does is designed to create it. The republicans genuinely said, enough of the population is dumb enough that we can get the dumbest person we can find, put them in office, and do whatever we want. They targeted every supporter because they knew how dumb they were.They've all been insultingly played and they are overjoyed about it. You cannot do a single thing to change it and you're absolutely right it will be baffling to anyone who reads about it in a history book(if those are still allowed by then)"

"I was raised to be honest regardless of how negative the outcome might be. I was raised to take ownership of my actions, for good or ill. I was raised to value intelligence and critical thinking, to learn and accept when I am proven wrong so that I may grow but to also drink deeply from the well of knowledge because it is infinite. I was raised to show empathy to those less fortunate than myself.

These were the lessons my parents taught me. Though I frequently fall short, I still strive to live by them.

My father betrayed every single one of them and he did so readily.

On one hand, the argument could be made that AM radio and Fox News lobotomized him over time and robbed him of his higher faculties....but that would absolve him of voluntarily submitting himself to the propaganda in the first place.

On the other, the argument could be made that the man who raised me was a mask and what I see now is who he has always actually be. That, perhaps, he has always been an anti-intellectual and bigot but never felt comfortable enough or had the courage to let the mask drop fully and is, instead, keen to rally behind the physical embodiment of his poisonous thoughts.

Neither ultimately matter to me, in the end.

I've said repeatedly elsewhere: I don't care why, I only care that he has.

I alternate between being embarrassed or wrathfully ashamed to even know him.

But what I have made explicitly clear to him is that I will never forgive him. It's not that I won't: I can't. He thought I was joking when I told him that all the way back in last November of 2025 after the election was called. Given how infrequently we talk now and given his surprise when I told him flatly, "I don't care if you leave me a dime when you pass, I just want your will iron clad so I don't have to waste my time or money fighting your other two sons in in court", that smug chuckle of amusement has grown into silence.

It's a pity we have to teach our parents the lesson of permanence."

Meanwhile he just murdered a boat full of people using little to no evidence, should probably get charged by the ICC for that, and is wasting billions of taxpayer dollars by painting a wall on the southern border (a well known construction accounting trick that criminals use to extract huge amounts of money) and fired all the administrative judges that ICE would be using to get warrants after having blocked a bill that would surge the number of those same judges.

If you just showed up at your father's house with a blowtorch and told him to wait and see and then started setting things on fire he'd call the police pretty fast, if not just shoot you. Meanwhile Trump is setting the future of this country on fire and we're just supposed to "wait and see" "

Also, they downplay slavery in many respects, so their comparisons get weaker when they are also downplaying the worst things in history.

"The biggest issue for Ukraine is still manpower and that's why a huge buildup of Russian troops is concerning.

Ukraine has taken extreme casualties throughout the war just as Russia has and the eastern front has been a giant hopelessly fortified meat grinder for 2 years now consuming tens of thousands on both sides.

Russia isn't doing well but they still have comparatively infinite manpower to draw on. Ukraine is literally running out of bodies to send to the front. Every man can only cover so much ground and the front is massive.

As your defenses are spread wider and wider your lines become thinner, your reinforcements less numerous, and the harder it becomes to move troops or equipment to problem areas.

If the Russians could get enough bodies together to make a truly large scale assault the entire Ukrainian line could collapse and that's more or less what Putin is hoping for, or if the number of troops is simply propaganda they're hoping to intimidate the Ukrainians into coming to the negotiating table before that hypothetical collapse could happen."

"It was because the democrats failed to protect and ultimately save the democracy and the people the democrats serve didn't give a shit and forgot about it. Biden refused to push Garland to make a decision before it was too late and now it's obvious he was worrking with the trump people. All of these court cases that got delayed and such turned out to have been done so because they were soft on or sympathetic towards Trump, thus making it impossible to prosecute him. The problem is that we have institutionalists and it was obvious as far as Biden's win that Trump was going to continue being a power while Biden and the Democrats remained institutionalists. The people of the US preferred to forget, so this became something of no priority which was proven by just a couple days of online outrage when they were pardoned.

If, by any chance, the Dems win 2026 and 2028, which is seemingly impossible, they will not clear the government and the country of the treasonous rot, thus leaving the way open for another in Trump's family to run. The problem also is that what Trump has done to the country will be a generational repair operation. There's no way the people will keep the democrats on long enough to oversee it and with all these terrorists still in the government, it's just going to happen again.

"A lot of americans hate america."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Many people, We The People, in USA hate human beings they disagree with. Hate itself motivates membership in tribes. “Hitlerism was a mass flight to dogma, to the barbaric dogma that had not been expelled with the Romans, the dogma of the tribe, the dogma that gave every man importance only in so far as the tribe was important and he was a member of the tribe.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. Donald Trump acting Tony Clifton provides constant hate magnet, constant mockery programming content. ===:::

"It's not just a feeling. The military parade in China, and especially the words of Xi, could very well mark the formal start of WW3.

It's basically NATO(Allies) vs The Axis...again. And they are already at war, with Ukraine being used as a proxy.

The issue is that Russia and China fired the first shots more than a decade ago, when they filled Western society with propaganda and misinformation (and we allowed it). They were so effective that they managed to install a puppet regime in the US, throwing all NATO allies into chaos.

There's no easy way out now, and I believe that's the real reason for the parade...they think they won. And honestly, if you look at the chaotic state of Western society, I would say they did. Hopefully, I'm mistaken."

All of those groups are essentially single issue, and will vote in lockstep with whatever party addresses their concerns.

What's also obvious is that none of those groups have any concerns that will actually affect the truly wealthy and powerful of this country.

Trump is just a puppet. He's not calling the shots or writing the EOs.

"Ok, respectfully, I get the desire to embellish; but 'enormous' is not the word that comes to mind when I watch the video. They took over maybe a city block, if that? Access to Trump Tower was not impugned in any real way. The numbers weren't particularly staggering. And...everyone will think I'm criticizing the protestors. I'm not. I'm criticizing the headline.

We, as a people, are exhausted by embellished sensationalized headlines that call us to action while presenting an image of media clip that presents a starkly different picture to what's being projected in the wording. This discredits and diminishes any attached movement, because it makes the movement seem, in the uninformed viewer's eyes, desperate for attention.

Essentially: You have called my attention to this event; and presented it as a large, substantive incident; when in reality it is no more or less then the hundreds and thousands of moderately sized protests I have already seen. You got my hope up that finally action was being taken; and the absence of that in reality, reminded me of the deficit of energy that we seem to be suffering. You have wasted my time, you have wasted my energy; and you made the movement seem desperate and inadequate.

I understand you have to write eye catching headline; it's your job. But don't rely on explosive wording to do it. It would have been a much better headline to say, "Protests across the nation against the Trump Regime ongoing. The latest has occurred in front of Trump Tower; and is the most recent indication that the movement is gathering steam."

Even better would have been to do some actual reporting; and finding out if there's any cross philosophy agitation involved; are there a handful of former Red Hats? If so, what motivated them to change perspective. What's the common ground? What are the issues?

But hey. What can you do. We should have buried tabloid journalism when we had the chance. Instead of allowing an unnecessary unholy union of information and entertainment."

"They're not even complicit, the media is *the* reason politics has devolved so much so quickly. News outlets chasing clicks spin headlines to drive outrage-based engagement because that's where the money is, so self centered politicians start using rhetoric that's easy to write those same sorts of headlines about, and it just goes round and round until we end up with state sponsored media writing hit pieces on whoever's against their biggest money makers because they know it sells.

There's no such thing as journalistic integrity when a news org is for profit, and everything wrong with the US currently (and world politics to a lesser degree) can be traced back to the media and their silver tongued pundits."

This is a LONG standing problem of the Bible fiction storytelling in USA. Sports games, video games, addictions to competition to entertainment - not learning nonfiction self-improvement.

Neil Postman's 1985 book explains this as best as can be done in a short 1984 page book. The addiction to clickbait and addiction to egoism filter-bubbles has taken over society.

"But it’s not just Fox anymore…. There are so many networks, and then you get into the real meat: YouTube and podcasts. There are simply not enough boomers to keep this going. They needed young people, and they used modern platforms to get a message out that resonated with them. It’s terrifying, and it happened in Germany leading up to the 2nd world war.

But when you called them Nazis, for YEARS, voices on the right AND the left called you an alarmist. The left slept through this. They pandered to minorities without offering a plan to make their lives better. They championed issues that impacted less than 3% of the electorate while not telling the lower class as a whole how they will be moving to a new middle class within 10 years. Nothing.

Fox enables all of this, and they are MAGA heroin for sure. But that makes social media MAGA meth, and the red hats have mastered social media in the same way the left figured out the 24 hour news cycle first in the early 90s. And the lefts lack of effective leadership is doing the red hats every favor in the world.

If there was a party trying to let a dictator take over, the Dems are doing a fantastic job fitting that mold. They won’t emulate an opposition party, aren’t providing plans that people can easily understand and sell to others, so what the fuck are they doing? In 2025 I give the democrats the MAGA MVP award. Hopefully shit changes fast."

"That's because, just like Wakanda, the "America" that you saw was a fictional creation based on the media's portrayal of America. People in AMERICA believe that the REAL America is somewhere else out there, somewhere nice and clean and fancy, where everyone's happy and life is fairly easy.

Not in THEIR town of course but somewhere.

It's part of where the anger and entitlement particularly of less educated/traveled people in the USA is coming from, the concept of "relative poverty" is important in psychology....if you have a perfectly nice and nutritious meal, but everyone else around you is having something fancier to eat, suddenly your nice nutritious meal may seem like garbage to you because everyone else is having something nicer.

Which is stupid, okay, but that's how our minds work.

People with an education who have travelled around a bit understand that the USA is not what the media makes it appear to be, and so they're not as bothered by the idea of relative poverty.

But people who do NOT have that experience see their adequate lives in their town as being RELATIVELY garbage because they're comparing their life situation to Wakanda, basically, and they're mad that they will never get a chance to go live there. And they get even MORE mad when anyone tries to make changes that would actually make their lives better, because they already believe that so many other people have lives so much better than theirs, and political figures have taken advantage of that to push the idea that it will get worse if we do anything like, say, health care for all.

They literally don't understand it's not real and that damn near everything they think they know is a lie."
