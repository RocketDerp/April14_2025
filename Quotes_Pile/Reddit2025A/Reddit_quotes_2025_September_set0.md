"We Should Put Our Phones Down’: Utah Governor Says ‘There Is a Tremendous Amount of Disinformation’ About Charlie Kirk Assassination"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  Better headline focus of our amusement-driven entertainment-driven USA society of 2025: Ficiton outsells nonfiction. Charlie Kirk was providing fiction storytelling at the university to a crowd of over 3,000. And now fiction on the Internet about the killing / murder outsells nonfiction. ===:::

"What you see on reddit has changed *a lot* in the last few years.

Unless you watch /new, you'll only see what the algorithm wants you to see. If you install a plugin that shows when your own posts are deleted, or posts are 'unapproved', you'll see how much active manipulation is happening.

About 1/3 of posts I comment on in /new end up 'unapproved' by *admins*, not mods. What that means is that they still show in a direct link, you can comment on them, but they will never be shown in a feed or the sub itself.

I don't remember a specific date when it started, but it was after the API debacle. Prior to that I had only had comments removed in specific and expected ways. I'm not saying they're directly related, but the API lock down would have made it much harder for a 3rd party to monitor site wide.

Edit- and I'm sure /new has filtering of some kind too, its just not as aggressive or nothing would make it past."

Did anybody ever listen to that? The shit he said behind the liberals backs to his buddies, like Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation?

Respectful would be tough to spin if they has a list of his biggest radio hits. My favorite was when he would call the opposition Demons.

His debate persona wasn't genuine. Nobody was going to 'change his mind'. He put on a mask so he could proselytize to a wider audience and lure in confused people with bullshit. Just a typical charlatan huckster."

"It really is. Been watching it happen here over the past two days.

Couple of the current lies are:

"He was murdered for his opinions!" Nope, that's absolutely not the reason why, is gross simplification, and a complete distortion of the truth, but it sounds really good for their side and makes him appear to be some kind of noble martyr.

And in response to his on the record quotes of it just being necessary for some people to die to gun violence: "That's not what he meant! He meant it was sad and unfortunate but couldn't be avoided! More people die in cars every year, should we ban all cars???" In addition to car and gun deaths being a nonsensical comparison between apples and potatoes, it's also a complete red herring meant to do nothing more than pull you away from the fact that he was an absolutely vile person that advocated for children to die to gun violence, as long as they weren't his children, of course, in order to stoke the support of right wing gun fetishists.

Just like all of his utterly fake "change my mind" debates, it has been crafted to push a narrative that to a noncritical thinker looks perfectly rational. But it's all fake, it's all a facade, it's all for show."

"Everyone seems to have forgotten quickly that when Trump was shot, they all rushed to say the shooter must have been a radical leftist liberal. Only that didn't turn out to be the case at all. If this Kirk shooter turns out to be MAGA, or comes from a MAGA family, then when do they realize the problem is not Democrats/liberals, it's the tone that has been set for several years now. Let's not forget that Trump has called for violence at his campaign rallies before when someone was protesting against him. He's often antagonistic, and pretty much a dick to any legitimate journalistic questions he doesn't like. This tough guy, mega-prick attitude sets the tone, and trickles down to all of his followers. It does not lead to positive outcomes."

nazis devised the global jewish conspiracy that went the same way. jews were always to blame somehow, some way. it didn’t matter who they were imor what they did. every foul thing was their fault somehow and it wasn’t ever about reality or fact or objectivity; it was about blaming jews and eventually killing then."

"They likely will do no introspection at all.

They are thirsty for bloodshed and have the guns necessary to go door to door to murder anyone and everyone they think is "the left", so that they can get a pool of blood to pour in a cup to sip on.

The shooter was a confirmed 22-year-old politically unaffiliated person who had a right-wing social media page and a 4chan account, yet they still act like it was the left that did it.

They are frothing at the mouth for their Herschel Grynszpan so that MAGA can make Charlie Kirk or any other right-winger whom they deem a martyr into their own Ernst vom Rath to set off their own version of the Kristallnacht."

"In the wake of the shooting the amount of videos that I saw yelling about "They..." Was ridiculous.

Like you or I or anyone else on this page or Democrat that voted for Trump or anyone that ever dared say that Trump or Charlie Kirk were wrong about something. We're the ones that personally advocated and pulled the trigger for this to happen.

They were calling for an all-out civil war for what we did.. and what we did was absolutely nothing except say wait to find out who the shooter is because you may not like the answer and the world and our politics are infinitely more complex than they realize.

I was on the conservative subreddit looking at all of their posts throughout the first day and the amount of angry posts talking about us saying that we're dumb and we don't understand what this will do to their base is completely absurd."

"I mean, to be fair, I think people did underestimate how this will affect the conservative base. They are idiots but they’re bloodthirsty idiots, looking for any excuse to exact revenge.

It’s honestly a real problem, one that is really tough to address. Reaching out to these people doesn’t work - it never has. They’re entrenched in their hatred of democrats and liberals. But the second they detect any condescension or semblance of a threat, they all circle the wagons and vote as a block. Not to mention call for abject violence.

You’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t. If you let them have their way then republicans will gleefully make everything worse just so that minorities can suffer. But if you try to resist then they lose their shit and claim to be oppressed. Then out come the guns."

Why is it constant messages since year 2013 when the Internet Researh Agency went online on social media that "the liberals" are all evil, the MAGA are all evil, and not any discussion of exactly what Cambridge Analytica doctors of psycholoogy manipulated in minds? Reactionary short-length Twitter messaging of simplistic us vs. them Americans hate Americans messages... also note the use of the world "really", as in reality, as in media messages off Reddit machines. Also promotes the idea that death is secretly enjoyable and that we are all missing out in a lifestyle of enjoying the death and suffering of other human people. A bullshit perspective on the meaning of "enjoy" itself, a terrorist thinking that people should be rescued from - not trated as an authentic grasp of joy "enjoy" meaning in life.

The IRA went online in 2013, the Conservative International agreement was announced December 2013 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ - and Malala's book from Swat Valley Pakistani was published in October 2013. And social media keeps eating the IRA Kremlin information warfare an avoiding Malala's book ideas. In the John Stewart interview, Malala said World War Three was coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjGL6YY6oMs - and she described it like the film "Civil War" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(film) that was already happening in Swat Valley Pakistan. And Malala's October 2013 interview was right before the February 2014 Ukraine war, neighbor fighting neighbor now for all those years Russia attacking Ukraine.  I do not see people declaring we need to love one another, love mother earth, Woodstock 1969 was heading in the right direction with messages. I instead see messages saying MAGA is predictable movement with predictable outcomes. Which Malala was saying predictable outcomes - but pointing out that without love and compassion - is life really good? Is Taliban life even good for the Taliban leaders? I don't believe that. It's all an error / mistake in education and comprehension. Exactly the topics Malala is addressing - bad and terrible education. often rooted in horrific interpretations of fiction (metaphor) Quran and Bible literacy. “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

"This is the problem facing America; the far-right views the center and so-called "left" with equal conviction and belief that they're the problem. All while completely ignoring their own very actions, by leaders and talking heads, and by their own fellow MAGA everytime violence occurs. They only accept as facts and truth the things that reaffirm their already held beliefs. They only believe that which paints the "left" in a poor light, and anything that makes MAGA look bad is hand waived away as fake news, witch hunt, deep state lies.

These are not mentally well people, and I sadly do not know how we come back from this before things get much much worse. At the very least it would require an actual leader in power that cares about healing the country, one with tact, grace, intelligence and emotional/general intelligence. Instead we have another mentally unwell man child with clear traits of malignant narcissism who will stop at nothing to get revenge on his perceived enemies (you are NOT to try and hold him to account for his crimes, because they're all made up to hurt him. Otherwise they will accuse you of the same thing and lessen the meaning of justice and his own wrongs). Just like Miller using "insurrectionists" here, or Trump going after people for "mortgage fraud", ya know, the exact same thing he was convicted of. It's saddening and frustrating beyond belief to sit back and watch America burn because an entire political group has been proagandized to about only being to trust the media that lies to them. It's a crazy world we're in and honestly I'm exhausted by just how dumb it all really is, and how easily half of America is leading us all off a cliff, only to whine about "Dems, LGBTQ, "woke" destroying America.

Just like with the trans boogeyman they've all been hammering on social media and in the news after the one of many school shootings recently. No amount of facts, hard proof and data is going to make them change their tone and admit that trans mass shooters are few and far between, but they aren't going to let that keep them from acting like nearly all mass shootings are trans. They'll ignore the fact that men account for over 95% of shootings and over 55% are White Men, but sure let's focus on the less than 1% to blame for this. They started the propaganda immediately with Kirks death, calling for violence against the "left" and going to "war" (Fox News has made everything a war against poor victim conservatives since the '90s, but sure, they're not to blame for the divide in America AT ALL).

It's like a mass mental illness, and that is making everyone unwell dealing with their constant gaslighting, projecting, lying, etc. Something has to give ON THE RIGHT or this country is headed for self-destruction."

Beyond barking at individual trees on social machines and declaring a forest-wide crisis of mutliple NATO nations and learning and studying the specific and details of how Russian information warfare since March 2013 works. It is beyond people to go to the public library and get a book about Russian information warfare, cult deprogramming, and instead to just comment over and over in short messages that it is a cult, that it is terorism. People are not coming together to address the Fox News content crisis and educate media ecology by promoting Jen Senko's year 2015 film, and instead creating unique tiny little social machine comments hour after hour on different pages.

"It's how you differentiate the left from leftists. Leftists will very publicly state they no longer care about 'taking the high road', they see it as fighting fire with fire by doing exactly what they accuse the right of doing.

There are 3 options in these situations. Celebrate, condemn, or just remain quiet. More people just need to take the 3rd option, unfortunately narcissism prevents them."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Can not possibly be any answers outside these 3. Such as educating and teaching about Russian informatio warfare, which is not one of the three listed. Humanity driven by ignorance. "the left" vs "the leftists" crap, without detailed specific lists of values. "the hgh road" also a wildcard. I don't see people supporting Malala's education movement since she published her book in October 2013. What "high road" are people taking towards world peace and right-wing Taliban?  What most Reddit meme addicts mean by "high road" isn't anything close to education / teachg / comprehension / understanding of human mob mentality and information warfare problems / how billionares manipulate audiences. A "high raod" would be using Reddit to promtoe every single day, every 12 hours for years, Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News and hate-based right-wing media. I dn't see anyone using social media to promote that "high road", but I see social media fiction content addicts promoting action media content of shootings captured on video.  People who want more action, entertainment, hyper reality out of their society and prize Donald Trump's antics and nonsense to constantly mock and insult on media machines. The idea of a health intellectually organized and peacefu society is treated as boring and undesirable. Nonficiton is avoided in favor of promoting celebration of ignroance and celebration of violence (like the Middle East celebrates violence over other humans) ===:::

"I'm strongly of the belief circa 2015 the entire world just forget narcissists exist. So many people just refuse to accept people do or say things solely to get attention rather than actually believing it."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This Reddit comment is describing fiction. People who create a fiction show like Star Wars Andor "solely to get attention" (artists creating content for an audience, for profit, wealth, attention, social power, mindshare power). But don't actually believe that a galaxy far far away is Star Wars is real factual history / reality. Donald Trump creates fiction, Putin creates fiction. Fiction is the whole basis of the Russian information warfare. This Reddit comment is describing that in year 2015 people lost their ability to distinguish fiction from nonfiction (or were induced to be attracted deeply to self-harm fiction). Aritsts and video game creators and film makers / TV show creators constantly are creating fiction messages they don't believe in. Many are even paid to do so for major corporations or goverments, such as [paid employees of Russia's Internet Research Agency since year 2013 to create comments on Reddit and other Internet media systems](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643) https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 .

Considering the train wreck that mental health care has been in America since Reagan, I strongly suspect my disorder is among many friends in that regard. At some point, for a lot of people, it's going to make more sense to go off the deep end that it will to maintain sanity.

The fact that the motive is still unclear doesn't matter and is, in fact, seemingly preferred since they can spin whatever narrative and motive they want. I can't help but see their anger now as just performative and bad faith. They want a casus belli. If their own must be sacrificed for it, so be it."

"I think too many believe the system is fine, its just they are getting a raw deal through bad luck, conspiracy against them, whatever. We are prolific at manufacturing excuses.

More than that, though, its that people do not understand the system, don't care to learn, and just accept it is what it is and try to figure out how to fill their lives with copes and distractions enough to deaden the pain of failure and apathy. Ironic we're discussing this in a venue for hyper plugged in NBA fans who need constant discussion to get their fix."

"This is a blinkered view of political analysis. It's not a "purity test" or egotistical to evaluate the political valence of a particular political party in a world historical perspective. With your framework,  it's impossible to say that the dominant political parties have drifted rightwards. 

Saying up vs down is more accurate is absurd. There are plenty of right wing narratives that use this format and they are 100% wrong."

"Once upon a time, we built a system of Enlightenment reasoning and discussion. If you refrained from participating in that, if you insisted on telling bald-faced lies that nobody including yourself actually believed, if you did not respect evidence, if you were openly predatory, you were professionally ostracized, personally shunned, reviled, no benefit of the doubt granted. It was a matter of honor, of basic social conduct. It was justification for reprisal. Either you're somebody we can have a conversation with, or you're a dangerous lunatic who infringed on our society that we must be rid of as soon as possible.

"Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself" said your senior leadership.

Yes sir, said you. And then went to post about how they might not have your best interest in mind on Reddit.

These aren't beliefs, they're thin pretenses. He doesn't believe these stories that he is telling literally. Your boss isn't telling you he doesn't believe in inflation, he's telling you "Fuck you!

He explained he is anti-Russia but could understand this justification, at least.

I had to explain to him how that is purposefully misleading half truth that leaves out all the treaties Russia repeatedly broke which led NATO trying to expand its influence.

"People seem to lack any kind of comprehension of how methodically social media has been gamed. People think it's just some bad actors like Russia or China doing this. Plenty of groups within America are involved in disinformation.

Please remember that just because their is a name and maybe a face, that you have no idea if that is an actual person. They still barely try to hide these accounts because so many people lack any form of critical thinking skills.

Part of the solution, as I see it, is to unplug. Stop watching TV. This is why they're actively attacking unbiased sources like NPR and other public news sources. "Liberal bias" is such a scam. Big business owns 98% of media both traditional and non. They control the narratives based on money. The same can be said about places like reddit.

They are trying to sabotage the hostage deal. By launching an attack on qatari soil (qatar is an intermediator between hamas/israel) they want the qatari to pull out of the negotiations and thus the israeli can say qatar is to blame for the hostages not being released.

Article: Security chiefs, negotiators, US all said blaming Netanyahu for tanking hostage talks

This has happened before. The hostages could have been home over a year ago. But the Israelis want the genocide to continue.

This also covers up yesterday drone attack in the sumud flotilla. I wouldn't be surprised if the had a third attack in bound to iran or somewhere else.

And this while having, together with the U.S., some of the most advanced intelligence capabilities in the world, yet they choose to carpet-bomb Gaza as if it were 1942."

The USA and Israel told Qatar they were going to do this and Qatar signed off. They are just going to release a press release condemning it to save face but will do nothing. This was long overdue. Hamas refused to surrender and now Gaza city will be taken by force. Play stupid games win stupid prizes."

Conservatives are *literally* the party of slavers and nazis. They've been against civil rights, women's rights, equal rights, labour rights, gay rights, trans rights, etc. the entirety of their existence. They are literally the group who rose up when monarchies fell and democracy rose to fight FOR the nobles retaining their (unfair and unearned) privileges and power. They are *literally* the party of social/cultural hierarchies.

Y'all are surprised that they support Trump?

Trump isn't an anomaly of conservatism, he's the inevitability of conservatism. He's the whole fucking point."

"These people navigate their lives by social proof and mindless consumerism, and they absolutely need a media caricature of a righteous power daddy to tell them what to do, think, and feel. We live in an age of media zombies. These people live in a top-down, paternalistic hyperreal fever dream, and would trust the reality TV guy over their own dear little granny or next door neighbor. Nothing is real unless it is on TV, and their [Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) reinforces that the wealthy and powerful can do no wrong.

Southern Redeemers and Confederate propagandists won the cultural Civil War over the course of the 20th century. We are living in a country in which the Yankee ideal of liberty and rule of law has been defeated. These paleo-conservatives are not only taking us back to a time before the American Revolution, they want to erase the Enlightenment from history all together.

While the rest of the country was becoming a modern pluralistic democracy from the 1870s to the 1960s, the South was inventing the modern idea of apartheid. When Trump and modern Republicans speak of "retribution," they are talking about taking revenge on the rest of us who believe in democracy and universal suffrage. They are still mad about Reconstruction (which failed within 10 years anyway), Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights era, and the Voting Rights Act (which they already dismantled). We are entering a new "reconstruction" in which people of Southern worldview are the new "carpetbaggers" imposing their ideal of apartheid and white slave power oligarchy on the rest of the country.

Reconstruction failed and Southern Redeemers were allowed to take hold of the media over the course of the 20th century, and here we are. The Right always talks about a mythical "woke" leftwing Hollywood, because historically the exact opposite is true. From The Birth of a Nation which developed many of the modern Hollywood cinematography techniques, to Gone with the Wind, to the Hollywood Blacklist, John Wayne and Roy Rogers' "cowboy frontier thesis mythology" which Ronald Reagan effectively weaponized in his fascist rise to power, to reality television and the rise of Donald Trump. The media is built around placating the sensibilities of Southern teenagers. The rest of us never had a chance."

There are issues going on in this country that are not partisan issues, but those in power keep making them partisan issues to keep the people divided, because if the people actually united the the people in power would actually pay for their crimes and have to answer to the people they're supposed to be working for not against .

Alas, people do indeed do this, and find that the audience is addicted to left vs. right one-bit logic thinking. Which the Founding Fathers did not promote in the Decleration of Independence, Great Seal, or Constitution. The boundless faith that there are TWO and ONLY TWO sides to every problem: Republican vs Democrat!  One-bbit thinking.

Not left vs. right logic. Not single-bit, but 13-steps on the pyramid up the Great Seal. "there hasn’t been a strong Democratic competitor since Obama" - which is declaring that Donald Trump is a great competititor. Trump selling fiction, Donald Trump and Fox News sell fiction.

We need to think of the government the same way we think of driving: It's better to act predictsbly than to act polite. If somebody gerrymanders, you gerrymander back to demonstrate live why it's an unsustainable disenfranchising tactic so we can end it.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : QUESTION: "When did empathy become so polarizing?"
ANSWER: Joseph Campbell lessons for Star Wars audiences filmed by George Lucas in summer of 1986: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In bounded communities, aggression is projected outward. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. **The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other**. This is the sense of the word “gentile” — the person is not of the same order." (see also Islamic "infidel", Christian "non-believer" terms to match up "gentile") ===:::

"I watch Parkergetajob on YouTube, and his whole schtick is having folks debate him about why they support Trump. what I've learned watching his channel is that most Trumpers do not understand what a source is - they will frequently make a confident statement, and, when pressed about why they think that's true, they will usually say that they just think it's true. no laws referenced, no executive orders mentioned, just that they're happy Trump is fixing America based off vibes and social media posts.

the most consistent weird thing is that they all "don't agree with everything he does," so they can totally ignore the rape and child trafficking and sexualization of his own daughter and all the other weird or criminal shit, yet, they all believe in their own flavor of Trump who has done imaginary things that they're thrilled about, despite there being no proof about any of it.

like, just yesterday, there was a guy claiming that Trump has ended six wars. when pressed on it, he very confidently mentioned that one of the conflicts Trump ended was the situation in Gaza. this dude - as of yesterday, September 6th, 2025 - said that "it's not even a thing anymore" and that the region has been under a ceasefire since Trump stepped in. when and where did Trump step in? when did he step in? totally unclear. when it was brought up that there was a double-tap explosive attack on a hospital with a bunch of journalists in it just a few days ago, well, actually, nuh-uh.

I have no doubt that most of these people would be institutionalized if we were still doing that shit."

"...for all you blue people" even here I still thought she was going to show the emotion we call happy, maybe a bit of unbecoming smugness, but happiness all the same. "..TO BE PISSED ABOUT IT!"

"I think the mass delusion of what I call “digital adjacency” is very real and very dangerous. Partially due to social engineering and partially due to his weird “authentic” voice, Trump successfully leveraged Facebook and Twitter to propel him to the White House in 2015. People really believed he was “speaking to them,” “telling it like is,” “talking like them.”

Somehow, he continues to mainline his presence into a frightening number of American households via Truth Social - often hourly - employing virtually the same schtick from ten years ago. The dopamine hit MAGA voters feel when they receive a push notification from Donald Trump should never be underestimated. Many of them believe he has a personal relationship with them. Think about the percentage of text messages an average MAGA voter receives on a daily, weekly, yearly basis from Donald J. Trump. Compare that to the number they receive, or don’t, from the other people in their lives.

If we make out of this second term with some semblance of our democracy intact, this decade-and-a-half is going to confound historians for the next 200 years."

"And what do you do? It's seriously like a religion. There is no argument against it. A group of people support him because he said so. That's it.

The lack of education is the other MAJOR factor along with everything you said. Listen to how he speaks. He has the vocabulary of a 3rd grader and the solutions to problems of one too. He speaks in a way they can all understand and his solutions to anything are so simple minded that they make sense to anyone who lacks actual problem solving skills and critical thinking. Ask a 3rd grader how to fix something and they'll give you a solution that would never even come close to working and they'll tell you confidently because on a basic level it seems obvious to them. That's as far as these people can think and they shout it from the rooftops as if everyone else is just blind to it.

It's not just that they feel like there's some special connection, everything he says and does is designed to create it. The republicans genuinely said, enough of the population is dumb enough that we can get the dumbest person we can find, put them in office, and do whatever we want. They targeted every supporter because they knew how dumb they were.They've all been insultingly played and they are overjoyed about it.

"I was raised to be honest regardless of how negative the outcome might be. I was raised to take ownership of my actions, for good or ill. I was raised to value intelligence and critical thinking, to learn and accept when I am proven wrong so that I may grow but to also drink deeply from the well of knowledge because it is infinite. I was raised to show empathy to those less fortunate than myself.

These were the lessons my parents taught me. Though I frequently fall short, I still strive to live by them.

My father betrayed every single one of them and he did so readily.

On one hand, the argument could be made that AM radio and Fox News lobotomized him over time and robbed him of his higher faculties....but that would absolve him of voluntarily submitting himself to the propaganda in the first place.

On the other, the argument could be made that the man who raised me was a mask and what I see now is who he has always actually be. That, perhaps, he has always been an anti-intellectual and bigot but never felt comfortable enough or had the courage to let the mask drop fully and is, instead, keen to rally behind the physical embodiment of his poisonous thoughts.

Neither ultimately matter to me, in the end.

I've said repeatedly elsewhere: I don't care why, I only care that he has.

I alternate between being embarrassed or wrathfully ashamed to even know him.

But what I have made explicitly clear to him is that I will never forgive him. It's not that I won't: I can't. He thought I was joking when I told him that all the way back in last November of 2025 after the election was called. Given how infrequently we talk now and given his surprise when I told him flatly, "I don't care if you leave me a dime when you pass, I just want your will iron clad so I don't have to waste my time or money fighting your other two sons in in court", that smug chuckle of amusement has grown into silence.

It's a pity we have to teach our parents the lesson of permanence."

Meanwhile he just murdered a boat full of people using little to no evidence, should probably get charged by the ICC for that, and is wasting billions of taxpayer dollars by painting a wall on the southern border (a well known construction accounting trick that criminals use to extract huge amounts of money) and fired all the administrative judges that ICE would be using to get warrants after having blocked a bill that would surge the number of those same judges.

If you just showed up at your father's house with a blowtorch and told him to wait and see and then started setting things on fire he'd call the police pretty fast, if not just shoot you. Meanwhile Trump is setting the future of this country on fire and we're just supposed to "wait and see" "

They have no issue ordering people to comply with numerous rulings and ignoring their rights but when it comes to something that is actually a public good than it becomes evil.

Also, they downplay slavery in many respects, so their comparisons get weaker when they are also downplaying the worst things in history. I know there is a push to get rid of public education too but as a requirement to attend school, it does seem very legal. There is a clear public interest in vaccination on top of protecting the kids in the school system itself from needless illness and suffering."

"The biggest issue for Ukraine is still manpower and that's why a huge buildup of Russian troops is concerning.

Ukraine has taken extreme casualties throughout the war just as Russia has and the eastern front has been a giant hopelessly fortified meat grinder for 2 years now consuming tens of thousands on both sides.

Russia isn't doing well but they still have comparatively infinite manpower to draw on. Ukraine is literally running out of bodies to send to the front. Every man can only cover so much ground and the front is massive.

As your defenses are spread wider and wider your lines become thinner, your reinforcements less numerous, and the harder it becomes to move troops or equipment to problem areas.

If the Russians could get enough bodies together to make a truly large scale assault the entire Ukrainian line could collapse and that's more or less what Putin is hoping for, or if the number of troops is simply propaganda they're hoping to intimidate the Ukrainians into coming to the negotiating table before that hypothetical collapse could happen."

"It was because the democrats failed to protect and ultimately save the democracy and the people the democrats serve didn't give a shit and forgot about it. Biden refused to push Garland to make a decision before it was too late and now it's obvious he was worrking with the trump people. All of these court cases that got delayed and such turned out to have been done so because they were soft on or sympathetic towards Trump, thus making it impossible to prosecute him. The problem is that we have institutionalists and it was obvious as far as Biden's win that Trump was going to continue being a power while Biden and the Democrats remained institutionalists. The people of the US preferred to forget, so this became something of no priority which was proven by just a couple days of online outrage when they were pardoned.

If, by any chance, the Dems win 2026 and 2028, which is seemingly impossible, they will not clear the government and the country of the treasonous rot, thus leaving the way open for another in Trump's family to run. The problem also is that what Trump has done to the country will be a generational repair operation. There's no way the people will keep the democrats on long enough to oversee it and with all these terrorists still in the government, it's just going to happen again.

"It's not just a feeling. The military parade in China, and especially the words of Xi, could very well mark the formal start of WW3.

It's basically NATO(Allies) vs The Axis...again. And they are already at war, with Ukraine being used as a proxy.

The issue is that Russia and China fired the first shots more than a decade ago, when they filled Western society with propaganda and misinformation (and we allowed it). They were so effective that they managed to install a puppet regime in the US, throwing all NATO allies into chaos.

There's no easy way out now, and I believe that's the real reason for the parade...they think they won. And honestly, if you look at the chaotic state of Western society, I would say they did. Hopefully, I'm mistaken."

All of those groups are essentially single issue, and will vote in lockstep with whatever party addresses their concerns.

What's also obvious is that none of those groups have any concerns that will actually affect the truly wealthy and powerful of this country.

"The other issue is that they aren’t actually evaluating it as a game, they are all mocking it for its format. As if both great and crap games don’t come in every format.

Saying “not another side-scroller” would be like saying “not another comedy” about a movie. It’s not like there is some finite number of comedy movies that can exist, nor that just because there are a lot of comedies that nobody could ever make a great one."

"Ok, respectfully, I get the desire to embellish; but 'enormous' is not the word that comes to mind when I watch the video. They took over maybe a city block, if that? Access to Trump Tower was not impugned in any real way. The numbers weren't particularly staggering. And...everyone will think I'm criticizing the protestors. I'm not. I'm criticizing the headline.

We, as a people, are exhausted by embellished sensationalized headlines that call us to action while presenting an image of media clip that presents a starkly different picture to what's being projected in the wording. This discredits and diminishes any attached movement, because it makes the movement seem, in the uninformed viewer's eyes, desperate for attention.

Essentially: You have called my attention to this event; and presented it as a large, substantive incident; when in reality it is no more or less then the hundreds and thousands of moderately sized protests I have already seen. You got my hope up that finally action was being taken; and the absence of that in reality, reminded me of the deficit of energy that we seem to be suffering. You have wasted my time, you have wasted my energy; and you made the movement seem desperate and inadequate.

I understand you have to write eye catching headline; it's your job. But don't rely on explosive wording to do it. It would have been a much better headline to say, "Protests across the nation against the Trump Regime ongoing. The latest has occurred in front of Trump Tower; and is the most recent indication that the movement is gathering steam."

Even better would have been to do some actual reporting; and finding out if there's any cross philosophy agitation involved; are there a handful of former Red Hats? If so, what motivated them to change perspective. What's the common ground? What are the issues?

But hey. What can you do. We should have buried tabloid journalism when we had the chance. Instead of allowing an unnecessary unholy union of information and entertainment."

There's no such thing as journalistic integrity when a news org is for profit, and everything wrong with the US currently (and world politics to a lesser degree) can be traced back to the media and their silver tongued pundits."

We are not teaching media ecology, fiction from nonfiction, and we are not teaming up as a society to support "the little guy" like baby boomer Jen Senko's 2015 documentary film about Fox News. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad - we are not rewarding honest and sincere people, we are not voting for politicians who are sincere and honest.

They pushed propaganda through tiktok just a few months before elections. The candidate participated in NO debates. Almost a year later, we see the people that voted for him around us.

Neil Postman's 1985 book explains this as best as can be done in a short 1984 page book. The addiction to clickbait and addiction to egoism filter-bubbles has taken over society.

"But it’s not just Fox anymore…. There are so many networks, and then you get into the real meat: YouTube and podcasts. There are simply not enough boomers to keep this going. They needed young people, and they used modern platforms to get a message out that resonated with them. It’s terrifying, and it happened in Germany leading up to the 2nd world war.

But when you called them Nazis, for YEARS, voices on the right AND the left called you an alarmist. The left slept through this. They pandered to minorities without offering a plan to make their lives better. They championed issues that impacted less than 3% of the electorate while not telling the lower class as a whole how they will be moving to a new middle class within 10 years. Nothing.

Fox enables all of this, and they are MAGA heroin for sure. But that makes social media MAGA meth, and the red hats have mastered social media in the same way the left figured out the 24 hour news cycle first in the early 90s. And the lefts lack of effective leadership is doing the red hats every favor in the world.

If there was a party trying to let a dictator take over, the Dems are doing a fantastic job fitting that mold. They won’t emulate an opposition party, aren’t providing plans that people can easily understand and sell to others, so what the fuck are they doing? In 2025 I give the democrats the MAGA MVP award. Hopefully shit changes fast."

"A wise person will scrutinize any information they consume. Try to poke holes in it until you can’t destroy it. Then and only then can you believe it to be factual. Just like a scientist does.

A MAGA does just the opposite. They blindly DEFEND all information and REFUSE to believe it could possible be incorrect. Anything that does not make them feel good is simply labeled FAKE NEWS. This is what children do.

“The other nine, decent, hard-working, ordinarily intelligent and honest men, **did not know** before 1933 that Nazism was evil. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil. And they **do not know** it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933–45 (published 1955).
“The phenomenon we have witnessed in Germany was nothing less than outbreak of epidemic insanity... **No one knew what was happening to him, least of all of the Germans**, who allowed themselves to be driven to the slaughterhouse by their leading psychopaths like hypnotized sheep.” ― Dr. Carl Jung, After the Catastrophe, 1945.

"That's because, just like Wakanda, the "America" that you saw was a fictional creation based on the media's portrayal of America. People in AMERICA believe that the REAL America is somewhere else out there, somewhere nice and clean and fancy, where everyone's happy and life is fairly easy.

Not in THEIR town of course but somewhere.

It's part of where the anger and entitlement particularly of less educated/traveled people in the USA is coming from, the concept of "relative poverty" is important in psychology....if you have a perfectly nice and nutritious meal, but everyone else around you is having something fancier to eat, suddenly your nice nutritious meal may seem like garbage to you because everyone else is having something nicer.

Which is stupid, okay, but that's how our minds work.

People with an education who have travelled around a bit understand that the USA is not what the media makes it appear to be, and so they're not as bothered by the idea of relative poverty.

But people who do NOT have that experience see their adequate lives in their town as being RELATIVELY garbage because they're comparing their life situation to Wakanda, basically, and they're mad that they will never get a chance to go live there. And they get even MORE mad when anyone tries to make changes that would actually make their lives better, because they already believe that so many other people have lives so much better than theirs, and political figures have taken advantage of that to push the idea that it will get worse if we do anything like, say, health care for all.

They literally don't understand it's not real and that damn near everything they think they know is a lie."

Like if trump was a-ok don't you think he'd have appeared on camera or tweeted or anything? It's starting to seem like even if he hasn't croaked he's medically incapacitated like he's had a stroke or is bedridden in some way. It's so fucking weird. As far as I know every time a president has had serious medical issues in the past it was quickly reported to the media. What's with all the secrecy?
