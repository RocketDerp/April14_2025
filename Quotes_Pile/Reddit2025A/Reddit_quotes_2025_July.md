"I am going to say something controversial. Trump is a symptom of a problem that I am not really sure is fixable. Removing Trump just puts another psycho in his place.

The whole system, for 50 years, has been building to this point. A culture of apathy, of anti-community, of competition, and ignorance has dropped us right here. I cannot imagine how you go back. How are you going to look at another citizen and be like "yeah, I can trust them." after this? Germany and Itally got completely destroyed in WWII and I think that sure helped bond everyone together.

Is Spain the model? I dont know enough about post-Franco Spain to know if it ever really recovered to a just non-corrupt democracy."

"John Stewart has compilations of hypocrisy going back like 30 years now... it's never going to work.

they're never going to notice or care about their hypocrisy. In fact, it helps them grow.

it's like how when a cult leaders predictions don't come true, the cult just deepens their belief. Each new lie is a loyalty test, that you pass by denying the evidence of your own eyes and ears for the party interpretation of events."

"How do these people not understand he was never going to release the Epstein files. He could have released them in his first administration but didn't. He was even somewhat equivocal about releasing them when asked during his campaign. So this recent cover up should not be a surprise.

My god, the stupidity is astounding!"

"It's infuriating

They will smugly throw at you made up facts that not even their own sources, that they also give you, show. Any pushback is met with elementary school insults that have nothing to do with the argument at hand (I've stated that if my taxes go to helping others in need, them I'm completely fine with them. They've called me a "cuck" of all things for this).

Just look at the floods in Texas. What happened is a direct result of down playing climate change and defunding the people who could have predicted and denying "useless" things like sirens. All of these Republican doings. So what do they do? Pray for God and that's it, of you bring up that we can stop this again they tell you to stop being political.

What can we do? They don't care about reality. They'll look at this post and say all of it was completely unrelated and down vote. What do you do when the people you just want to help ignore all reason and vote on gut instincts they don't have"

"I actually wonder if the Russian propaganda machine isn't in full-on glaze Trump mode anymore. I know that Putin is upset with Trump because they did stop the weapon shipments and then they got them back going again. Trump has been taking a harder line on Putin publicly. Not giving these thoughts a full-throated endorsement because who really knows what the fuck is going on. I do know I haven't seen the trumpers break rank this definitively since this whole thing started."

"Trump tickled their Id and corrupted their ego .

Just watch them when someone asks if Trump should have said whatever offensive remark he made and you can see them go into introspection before basically saying, 'No I shouldn't say that, I mean he shouldn't say that.'

And their individual ego has been surrendered to Trump's. They put HIS NAME on all THEIR property. My dad didn't give me much masculine insight. But he said that doing that is basically saying you are his slave and is the opposite of American Masculinity."

"Happened with Nixon. My pop said hardline conservative types denied violently supporting him (and yea they did - they literally waded into anti Nixon protests and beat the shit outta people) as soon as he left in disgrace.

Gave em a year and they denied ever supporting him.

We will get the same for Trump. 10 years from now, we will get sub reddits of people appalled finding a bunch of Trump shit up in the dead parents attic.

"I’ve seen several variations of these pics of this girl as memes. The one in this picture references “what Christopher Columbus saw when he disembarked in America.” There’s also a version where someone has photoshopped the woman’s hair to blonde and reads “What the Romans saw when they disembarked in England/Brittania” (last part depending on how smart the person who made the meme wants to sound, I guess).

I think the joke is that both Columbus and the Romans kept sex slaves. Since I am bad at age, I’ll leave it there - but worth noting that age wasn’t a disqualifying factor for either Columbus or the Romans."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Very popular topic on Reddit, underage sex and other cultures. Today is July 16, 2025 - and Epstein priate jet private sex island is non-stop topic for past days when this comment was made. The thing I always see absent from these discussions is historical context of childbirth death and life expectancy, and the quantity of children per mother. In year 1492, life expectancy was 35 years, today in year 2025 it can be 75 years. So getting married and having children at age 15 isn't the same in *Roman times* or today. Nor did people have hospitals and 911 service. Life and death was very different interpretations. Progress in medical and moral fronts is important to recognize. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Exactly, I agree with this comment. Reddit community is constantly normalizing the Trump situation for over a decade, downplyaing the threat as "good news" (subreddit name context). Dehumanizing Americans is not *good news*, and it is adding hate to the Donald Trump MAGA hate pile. *Good news* would be hundreds of millions of USA people asserting goodness and actually choosing positive paths and following them. Putin mind-fuck started in March 2013, Trump announced run for President in June 2015, this has been going on for more than a decade with every month worse than the past, the path has been horrific. People who use social media are living in anti-reality, not facing up to real reality of how hearts and minds are lost and that people are not adopting sincere and good, but instead adopting hate and falsehoods of MAGA / Donald Trump social media. ===:::
