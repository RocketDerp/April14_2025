"I am going to say something controversial. Trump is a symptom of a problem that I am not really sure is fixable. Removing Trump just puts another psycho in his place.

The whole system, for 50 years, has been building to this point. A culture of apathy, of anti-community, of competition, and ignorance has dropped us right here. I cannot imagine how you go back. How are you going to look at another citizen and be like "yeah, I can trust them." after this? Germany and Itally got completely destroyed in WWII and I think that sure helped bond everyone together.

Is Spain the model? I dont know enough about post-Franco Spain to know if it ever really recovered to a just non-corrupt democracy."

"John Stewart has compilations of hypocrisy going back like 30 years now... it's never going to work.

they're never going to notice or care about their hypocrisy. In fact, it helps them grow.

it's like how when a cult leaders predictions don't come true, the cult just deepens their belief. Each new lie is a loyalty test, that you pass by denying the evidence of your own eyes and ears for the party interpretation of events."

"How do these people not understand he was never going to release the Epstein files. He could have released them in his first administration but didn't. He was even somewhat equivocal about releasing them when asked during his campaign. So this recent cover up should not be a surprise.

My god, the stupidity is astounding!"

"It's infuriating

They will smugly throw at you made up facts that not even their own sources, that they also give you, show. Any pushback is met with elementary school insults that have nothing to do with the argument at hand (I've stated that if my taxes go to helping others in need, them I'm completely fine with them. They've called me a "cuck" of all things for this).

Just look at the floods in Texas. What happened is a direct result of down playing climate change and defunding the people who could have predicted and denying "useless" things like sirens. All of these Republican doings. So what do they do? Pray for God and that's it, of you bring up that we can stop this again they tell you to stop being political.

What can we do? They don't care about reality. They'll look at this post and say all of it was completely unrelated and down vote. What do you do when the people you just want to help ignore all reason and vote on gut instincts they don't have"

"I think that from some time from now this will be recognized as a form of dementia; that starts with a cognitive dissociation that only gets worse as they develop and reinforce this schizophrenic worldview detached from their reality, that the brain is unable to maintain a consistent model of themselves and the world.

In layman terms, they are growing mad."

"Itâ€™s so funny to me to hear how well the propaganda works on some people.

People can barely even remember what he did, but yeah Biden was totally the most tyrannical leader weâ€™ve ever had ðŸ™„"

OutGroup: Subhuman OutGroup: Stupid    

Front page of Reddit social media on Sunday (Church Day) calling MAGA people "subhuman". - Very **Nazi values** (that the enemy is non-human, non-person, animals / sub-human) in USA 2025. This is what Donald Trump / MAGA values are: subhuman / dehumanization, out-group hate, hate motivation. A symbol of self-dehumanization of American We The People.

"The stupidest subhumans in the world have now taken to burning their MAGA hats after realizing that their favourite rapist doesn't care about rape island"

"I actually wonder if the Russian propaganda machine isn't in full-on glaze Trump mode anymore. I know that Putin is upset with Trump because they did stop the weapon shipments and then they got them back going again. Trump has been taking a harder line on Putin publicly. Not giving these thoughts a full-throated endorsement because who really knows what the fuck is going on. I do know I haven't seen the trumpers break rank this definitively since this whole thing started."

"Trump tickled their Id and corrupted their ego .

Just watch them when someone asks if Trump should have said whatever offensive remark he made and you can see them go into introspection before basically saying, 'No I shouldn't say that, I mean he shouldn't say that.'

And their individual ego has been surrendered to Trump's. They put HIS NAME on all THEIR property. My dad didn't give me much masculine insight. But he said that doing that is basically saying you are his slave and is the opposite of American Masculinity."

"Happened with Nixon. My pop said hardline conservative types denied violently supporting him (and yea they did - they literally waded into anti Nixon protests and beat the shit outta people) as soon as he left in disgrace.

Gave em a year and they denied ever supporting him.

We will get the same for Trump. 10 years from now, we will get sub reddits of people appalled finding a bunch of Trump shit up in the dead parents attic. It will be like finding KKK shit (and like that, more than a few closet shitbags will have it in a place of honor like the bunch of hicks they are)"
