"I am going to say something controversial. Trump is a symptom of a problem that I am not really sure is fixable. Removing Trump just puts another psycho in his place.

The whole system, for 50 years, has been building to this point. A culture of apathy, of anti-community, of competition, and ignorance has dropped us right here. I cannot imagine how you go back. How are you going to look at another citizen and be like "yeah, I can trust them." after this? Germany and Itally got completely destroyed in WWII and I think that sure helped bond everyone together.

Is Spain the model? I dont know enough about post-Franco Spain to know if it ever really recovered to a just non-corrupt democracy."

they're never going to notice or care about their hypocrisy. In fact, it helps them grow.

it's like how when a cult leaders predictions don't come true, the cult just deepens their belief. Each new lie is a loyalty test, that you pass by denying the evidence of your own eyes and ears for the party interpretation of events."

"It's infuriating

They will smugly throw at you made up facts that not even their own sources, that they also give you, show. Any pushback is met with elementary school insults that have nothing to do with the argument at hand (I've stated that if my taxes go to helping others in need, them I'm completely fine with them. They've called me a "cuck" of all things for this).

Just look at the floods in Texas. What happened is a direct result of down playing climate change and defunding the people who could have predicted and denying "useless" things like sirens. All of these Republican doings. So what do they do? Pray for God and that's it, of you bring up that we can stop this again they tell you to stop being political.

What can we do? They don't care about reality. They'll look at this post and say all of it was completely unrelated and down vote. What do you do when the people you just want to help ignore all reason and vote on gut instincts they don't have"

Just watch them when someone asks if Trump should have said whatever offensive remark he made and you can see them go into introspection before basically saying, 'No I shouldn't say that, I mean he shouldn't say that.'

And their individual ego has been surrendered to Trump's. They put HIS NAME on all THEIR property. My dad didn't give me much masculine insight. But he said that doing that is basically saying you are his slave and is the opposite of American Masculinity."

"I’ve seen several variations of these pics of this girl as memes. The one in this picture references “what Christopher Columbus saw when he disembarked in America.” There’s also a version where someone has photoshopped the woman’s hair to blonde and reads “What the Romans saw when they disembarked in England/Brittania” (last part depending on how smart the person who made the meme wants to sound, I guess).

I think the joke is that both Columbus and the Romans kept sex slaves. Since I am bad at age, I’ll leave it there - but worth noting that age wasn’t a disqualifying factor for either Columbus or the Romans."

Today is July 16, 2025 - and Epstein priate jet private sex island is non-stop topic for past days when this comment was made. The thing I always see absent from these discussions is historical context of childbirth death and life expectancy, and the quantity of children per mother. In year 1492, life expectancy was 35 years, today in year 2025 it can be 75 years. So getting married and having children at age 15 isn't the same in *Roman times* or today. Nor did people have hospitals and 911 service. Life and death was very different interpretations. Progress in medical and moral fronts is important to recognize. ===:::

[Andrew Postman's February 2017 deceleration](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley).

[A *baby boomer*, Jen Senko - born in a "red state" in 1954 has been ignored since March 2016 - why is her film and book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad) not constantly repeated on every social media platform by people who actually want to address the Rupert Murdoch / Donald Trump cults? People are constantly promoting civil war, terrorism, murder, killing, guns, weapon systems on social machine systems. People are addicted to the very behavior of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Kremlin and White House. People are entertained, amused, at the Surkovian techniques of Realty TV (The Apprentice, Trump) content from billionaires. Neil Postman spells all this out in his 1985 book. It is not *only MAGA* that is thrilled at the hate and gun stroking violence of Donald Trump status symbol of hate and mass dehumanization. ===:::

"We have a pedophile, a rapist, a convicted felon, a racist, and an all around piece of shit in office. How did we get here?

I think almost every person in a major political office is a piece of shit one way or another, but my God does Trump take the cake. This guy is something else. Was it really not seen as a big deal before recently that he was buddy buddy with the guy who turned out to have one of the biggest pedophile rings in the world and was using, abusing, torturing, raping, and molesting all these young girls?

Of course his followers will just turn a blind eye to that. They’ll leech off of Joe Biden making some really weird or creepy comments but think Trump shits gold when the evidence is all but laid out for the world to see. MAGA is literally a cult. I’ve never seen a group of people get so up in arms to defend someone that doesn’t give a single shit about them.

I just don’t understand how we as a country got here. This is ridiculous. This piece of shit has done multiple unconstitutional things, is unprofessional, and continues to make an ass out of himself on TV and embarrasses America in front of the entire world.

Fuck this guy

Edit: It really is telling of the state of our country and the people in it when stating your disgust with who is in office is somehow relegated to “karma farming.” Truly baffling. The people here defending Trump or brushing off what he’s done are part of the problem. This isn’t even a matter of opinion anymore.

Mocking "the others" is not resisting - it is content engagement, it's exactly what Surkovian chess is about.

"They only care about themselves so rape and any other bad thing is only bad if it happens to them. If it happens to others they don’t give a shit. It all comes down to empathy and they have none."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : USA people on social media behave as if this problem of girls being abused is only one political party in the USA. That a nation of 0.35 billion people out of world 8.0 billion is unique in sexual abuse cocnerns. Malala Yousafzai from Pakistain has been trying to give young girls a voice since year 2013... but she is grey-rocked by social media users. People on social media only seem to care about rich white men (Epstein / Trump / etc) while ignoring Malala Yousafzai's global efforts. When Malala [came to USA while Donald Trump was in office](https://malala.org/news-and-voices/malala-speech-atlanta), social media ignored her. ===:::

"When known, and documented, child molester and rapist Roy Moore was running for senate in Alabama a while back, a reporter asked a republican voter how they could vote for someone like that. His reply that if Moore had raped his own daughter he would punch Moore in the face and then still vote for him, because he is still better than a democrat. It is such a team sport, and they have been so brainwashed by right wing media to believe all democrats are even worse monsters, that they still view it as a lesser evil."

"politics has become so toxic that it's not seen as that abnormal anymore, or they just assume it's lies. Many others will vote the party line no matter who the candidate is.

And then yea many of them are actually rapists or hold rapey views so it doesn't bother them at all. Many times times when people say "family values" they don't mean more loving families, they mean families that hold more primitive beliefs."

"Scholars of evangelical Christianity (the main driving force in Republican politics) have described its obsession with sex, male domination, and rape culture, and how their voting patterns, etc, consistently support the right of men to dominate women and children. Their obsession with pedophilia reveals their need to externalize that kind of stuff rather than root it out in their own homes and churches."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Bible is science fiction storytelling. Fox News / Rupert Murdoch provides fiction storytelling. Donald Trump is creative fiction storytelling. The driving force of Repulican politics is anti-reality, fiction, avoidance of nonfiction. We saw this during [December 2019 onward pandemic regarding medical science, driven by Russian fiction](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192). ===:::

"Amateur sleuths are fucking ghouls and that’s a hill I will always die on. Like 5 success stories in decades and now they feel like they should have the unchecked ability to accuse people freely and ruin lives without consequence."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People have been saying that Paparazzi is bad for decades. Social media users have lost their ability to view media behaviors at the Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan level of self-awareness that everyday Internet users behave like classic Paparazzi. This stuff isn't covered in 2,000 year old Bible stories, they didn't have recorded video and Twitter in the Levant. Who is teaching morality? Social media users sure are not, they mock and insult, that isn't progressive education and teaching. Malala Yousafzai, who does teach remedial morality, is grey-rocked by social media society. ===:::

"I'm increasingly uncomfortable with the true-crime genre for basically this reason. People treat it as entertainment, and forget that there are real people involved. In the more extreme form it's like the weird parasocial relationships people form with podcasters, but with victims of crimes. I saw a post the other day were someone had to have her sister exhumed and cremated because to many true crime people were taking selfies at the grave site."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Neil Postamn's 1985 book "Entertaining Ourselves to Death" needs to be understood and asserted on social media every day for months and months, until every person in USA understand the ideas in the book, EVERYONE age 12 to age 120 needs to face up to this problem. It isn't just Elon Musk and Donald Trump entertainment that is killing us. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It is the whole nation who was defeated in an information war from Russia that started in March 2013 with the Internet Research Agency. It isn't just Republicans who have [not taken seriously things like QAnon](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/qanon-russia-conspiracy-theory-trump-2020-election-b1536946.html) - people who have adopted the Russia-induced out-group hate patterns of Americans hate Americans instead of seeing that [mutliple NATO nations (and beyond, Japan)](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/07/18/japan/politics/russia-influence-japan-election/) have reported the *Putin Media Invasion* - not just Republicans in USA. Neil Postamn's 1985 book has been sitting on the shelf to raise self-awareness of everyone, but people can not resist the out-group mocking and insult patterns. ===:::

"Historians will describe the media's need to "turn down the temperature" as complicity in the country's conversion from a democratic republic to full-blown dictatorship."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Whenever the topic of "media" comes up on social media, people avoid Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Peter Pomerantsev, etc. Social machine users act like social media consuemrs on Reddit don't create the same clickbait titles as "news sites". The audience is the problem, "Amusing Ourselves To Death" book in 1985 was created when Ronald Reagan was an entertainer politician like Donald Trump. Social media users did not in any way resist Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency, media was infiltrated by a hostile enemy - and people just mock other people as "bots" without citing any authors or [serious treatment of the subject](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). People in USA can't name dates, timeframes, players. Just off the cuff commentary (by no-identity Reddit users) like Donald Trump does on social media, no citation, no references, no experts. ===:::

"Am I taking crazy pills or wasn’t this already known for years at this point? He was on flight logs and all kinds of shit.

What’s exactly new here? Or is this just another collective exercise showing how the American electorate has the memory of a goldfish?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes, **much of this was already known and obvious** - but nobody wants to put down entertainment and stop the total mockery long enough to [face up that Neil Postman's 1985 book explains what is going on with Ronald Regan 1985 and Donald Trump 2025](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/).
