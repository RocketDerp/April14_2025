"I am going to say something controversial. Trump is a symptom of a problem that I am not really sure is fixable. Removing Trump just puts another psycho in his place.

The whole system, for 50 years, has been building to this point. A culture of apathy, of anti-community, of competition, and ignorance has dropped us right here. I cannot imagine how you go back. How are you going to look at another citizen and be like "yeah, I can trust them." after this? Germany and Itally got completely destroyed in WWII and I think that sure helped bond everyone together.

Is Spain the model? I dont know enough about post-Franco Spain to know if it ever really recovered to a just non-corrupt democracy."

"Let's be honest: their brains were rotted by propaganda on TV because they lack sophistication and are some of the most gullible folks out there."

"John Stewart has compilations of hypocrisy going back like 30 years now... it's never going to work.

they're never going to notice or care about their hypocrisy. In fact, it helps them grow.

it's like how when a cult leaders predictions don't come true, the cult just deepens their belief. Each new lie is a loyalty test, that you pass by denying the evidence of your own eyes and ears for the party interpretation of events."

"How do these people not understand he was never going to release the Epstein files. He could have released them in his first administration but didn't. He was even somewhat equivocal about releasing them when asked during his campaign. So this recent cover up should not be a surprise.

My god, the stupidity is astounding!"

"It's infuriating

They will smugly throw at you made up facts that not even their own sources, that they also give you, show. Any pushback is met with elementary school insults that have nothing to do with the argument at hand (I've stated that if my taxes go to helping others in need, them I'm completely fine with them. They've called me a "cuck" of all things for this).

Just look at the floods in Texas. What happened is a direct result of down playing climate change and defunding the people who could have predicted and denying "useless" things like sirens. All of these Republican doings. So what do they do? Pray for God and that's it, of you bring up that we can stop this again they tell you to stop being political.

What can we do? They don't care about reality. They'll look at this post and say all of it was completely unrelated and down vote. What do you do when the people you just want to help ignore all reason and vote on gut instincts they don't have"

"I think that from some time from now this will be recognized as a form of dementia; that starts with a cognitive dissociation that only gets worse as they develop and reinforce this schizophrenic worldview detached from their reality, that the brain is unable to maintain a consistent model of themselves and the world.

In layman terms, they are growing mad."

"Itâ€™s so funny to me to hear how well the propaganda works on some people. Biden was a wet blanket of a president, and yet they talk about him like he was some powerful God sent from the heavens to destroy the earth. People can barely even remember what he did, but yeah Biden was totally the most tyrannical leader weâ€™ve ever had ðŸ™„"

OutGroup: Subhuman OutGroup: Stupid    

Front page of Reddit social media on Sunday (Church Day) calling MAGA people "subhuman". - Very **Nazi values** (that the enemy is non-human, non-person, animals / sub-human) in USA 2025. This is what Donald Trump / MAGA values are: subhuman / dehumanization, out-group hate, hate motivation. A symbol of self-dehumanization of American We The People.

"The stupidest subhumans in the world have now taken to burning their MAGA hats after realizing that their favourite rapist doesn't care about rape island"
