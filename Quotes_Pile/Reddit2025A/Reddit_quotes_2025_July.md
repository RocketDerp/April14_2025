"I am going to say something controversial. Trump is a symptom of a problem that I am not really sure is fixable. Removing Trump just puts another psycho in his place.

The whole system, for 50 years, has been building to this point. A culture of apathy, of anti-community, of competition, and ignorance has dropped us right here. I cannot imagine how you go back. How are you going to look at another citizen and be like "yeah, I can trust them." after this? Germany and Itally got completely destroyed in WWII and I think that sure helped bond everyone together.

Is Spain the model? I dont know enough about post-Franco Spain to know if it ever really recovered to a just non-corrupt democracy."

"Let's be honest: their brains were rotted by propaganda on TV because they lack sophistication and are some of the most gullible folks out there."

"John Stewart has compilations of hypocrisy going back like 30 years now... it's never going to work.

they're never going to notice or care about their hypocrisy. In fact, it helps them grow.

it's like how when a cult leaders predictions don't come true, the cult just deepens their belief. Each new lie is a loyalty test, that you pass by denying the evidence of your own eyes and ears for the party interpretation of events."
