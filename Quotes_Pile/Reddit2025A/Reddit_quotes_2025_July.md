"I am going to say something controversial. Trump is a symptom of a problem that I am not really sure is fixable. Removing Trump just puts another psycho in his place.

The whole system, for 50 years, has been building to this point. A culture of apathy, of anti-community, of competition, and ignorance has dropped us right here. I cannot imagine how you go back. How are you going to look at another citizen and be like "yeah, I can trust them." after this? Germany and Itally got completely destroyed in WWII and I think that sure helped bond everyone together.

Is Spain the model? I dont know enough about post-Franco Spain to know if it ever really recovered to a just non-corrupt democracy."

they're never going to notice or care about their hypocrisy. In fact, it helps them grow.

it's like how when a cult leaders predictions don't come true, the cult just deepens their belief. Each new lie is a loyalty test, that you pass by denying the evidence of your own eyes and ears for the party interpretation of events."

"It's infuriating

They will smugly throw at you made up facts that not even their own sources, that they also give you, show. Any pushback is met with elementary school insults that have nothing to do with the argument at hand (I've stated that if my taxes go to helping others in need, them I'm completely fine with them. They've called me a "cuck" of all things for this).

Just look at the floods in Texas. What happened is a direct result of down playing climate change and defunding the people who could have predicted and denying "useless" things like sirens. All of these Republican doings. So what do they do? Pray for God and that's it, of you bring up that we can stop this again they tell you to stop being political.

What can we do? They don't care about reality. They'll look at this post and say all of it was completely unrelated and down vote. What do you do when the people you just want to help ignore all reason and vote on gut instincts they don't have"

Just watch them when someone asks if Trump should have said whatever offensive remark he made and you can see them go into introspection before basically saying, 'No I shouldn't say that, I mean he shouldn't say that.'

And their individual ego has been surrendered to Trump's. They put HIS NAME on all THEIR property. My dad didn't give me much masculine insight. But he said that doing that is basically saying you are his slave and is the opposite of American Masculinity."

"I’ve seen several variations of these pics of this girl as memes. The one in this picture references “what Christopher Columbus saw when he disembarked in America.” There’s also a version where someone has photoshopped the woman’s hair to blonde and reads “What the Romans saw when they disembarked in England/Brittania” (last part depending on how smart the person who made the meme wants to sound, I guess).

I think the joke is that both Columbus and the Romans kept sex slaves. Since I am bad at age, I’ll leave it there - but worth noting that age wasn’t a disqualifying factor for either Columbus or the Romans."

Today is July 16, 2025 - and Epstein priate jet private sex island is non-stop topic for past days when this comment was made. The thing I always see absent from these discussions is historical context of childbirth death and life expectancy, and the quantity of children per mother. In year 1492, life expectancy was 35 years, today in year 2025 it can be 75 years. So getting married and having children at age 15 isn't the same in *Roman times* or today. Nor did people have hospitals and 911 service. Life and death was very different interpretations. Progress in medical and moral fronts is important to recognize. ===:::

[Andrew Postman's February 2017 deceleration](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley).

[A *baby boomer*, Jen Senko - born in a "red state" in 1954 has been ignored since March 2016 - why is her film and book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad) not constantly repeated on every social media platform by people who actually want to address the Rupert Murdoch / Donald Trump cults? People are constantly promoting civil war, terrorism, murder, killing, guns, weapon systems on social machine systems. People are addicted to the very behavior of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Kremlin and White House. People are entertained, amused, at the Surkovian techniques of Realty TV (The Apprentice, Trump) content from billionaires. Neil Postman spells all this out in his 1985 book. It is not *only MAGA* that is thrilled at the hate and gun stroking violence of Donald Trump status symbol of hate and mass dehumanization. ===:::

"We have a pedophile, a rapist, a convicted felon, a racist, and an all around piece of shit in office. How did we get here?

I think almost every person in a major political office is a piece of shit one way or another, but my God does Trump take the cake. This guy is something else. Was it really not seen as a big deal before recently that he was buddy buddy with the guy who turned out to have one of the biggest pedophile rings in the world and was using, abusing, torturing, raping, and molesting all these young girls?

Of course his followers will just turn a blind eye to that. They’ll leech off of Joe Biden making some really weird or creepy comments but think Trump shits gold when the evidence is all but laid out for the world to see. MAGA is literally a cult. I’ve never seen a group of people get so up in arms to defend someone that doesn’t give a single shit about them.

I just don’t understand how we as a country got here. This is ridiculous. This piece of shit has done multiple unconstitutional things, is unprofessional, and continues to make an ass out of himself on TV and embarrasses America in front of the entire world.

Fuck this guy

Edit: It really is telling of the state of our country and the people in it when stating your disgust with who is in office is somehow relegated to “karma farming.” Truly baffling. The people here defending Trump or brushing off what he’s done are part of the problem. This isn’t even a matter of opinion anymore.

"When known, and documented, child molester and rapist Roy Moore was running for senate in Alabama a while back, a reporter asked a republican voter how they could vote for someone like that. His reply that if Moore had raped his own daughter he would punch Moore in the face and then still vote for him, because he is still better than a democrat. It is such a team sport, and they have been so brainwashed by right wing media to believe all democrats are even worse monsters, that they still view it as a lesser evil."

"I think, if anything, that the lack of understanding of how the Nazis and Hitler happened is sort of why we're where we are. A near-century of painting them as subhuman monsters may make it easier to process and compartmentalize their inhumanity and atrocities, but by ignoring that they are also fundamentally human too we overlook the [apathy and banality of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem) that truly leads towards these eventualities. For better or worse, these people aren't Orcish, Beowulfian representations of evil, they're our (hopefully former) friends, or coworkers, or neighbors, or even our family members."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : All the people who portray Putin, Russia, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, MAGA as *subhuman* are in a way making them *superhuman, beyond human* - as if the very foundation of social media content (Trump on Twitter year 2012) is not tied to popularity, as if Fox News was not the most popular news network (forcing other networks to adjust towards their style to compete for the audience attraction). Fundamentally, human people have to make the case for peace, compassion, empathy. Insulting people and being afraid to be *preachy* with good ideas and goodness itself discounts humanity in whole. So many are willing to die with weapon systems in hand, die for war, few willing to die confronting egoism / egomania with annoying unpopularity. I would never be spending my time doing what I am doing if I did witness the apathy towards Malala from Swat Valley since her October 8, 2013 book publishing by social media users. I almost never encounter people quoting and citing Malala's ideas and thinking. The banality of evil is that Donald Trump is entertaining, and Stephen Colbert isn't going to stand up to his own audience and say that his very amusement / South Park amusement, may be the very foundation of Russian Surkovian information warfare - as detailed by Neil Postman in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" about Twitter / Reddit / Bluesky behavior I have witnessed directly on social media. We build locks on doors and yet our clergy - our teachers of love and compassion - do not see that deporting people is building locks on our society, the USA prison population is our lock them up answer. We don't teach Neil Postman's media ecology to every person in our schools... we don't teach comparative mythology to every person in our schools... yet we change everything in response to September 11, 2001 terrorism - and we witness October 7, 2023 terrorism and Israel overkill response (they have no better answer to terrorism than bombing the hell out of homes and people, they can't distinguish combatants)... people are willing to die for violence, but how many are really willing to wear us down with sincere honesty? How many politicians anywhere in the world actually desire goodness and wear us down with sincere honesty? Is a peaceful loving compassionate caring world really that boring that it isn't worth it. Do people not really want Heaven and Utopia. Technology of killing will keep advancing, and the way we behave now is if social media had a "kill the other person" button next to the "block social media account" button, the USA hate around MAGA and Donald Trump values of treating ***out-group as subhuman*** would be an open slaughter. We can't even share Unicode text words without deporting each other on social media. And yet, we deny that this banal behavior of blocking and dehumanizing on social media isn't exactly how religions treat each other in out-group hate - and why deporting people in dramatic ICE raids isn't like Reality TV shows of COPS doing raids. We treat baby boomer Jen Senko as if her March 2016 film and book isn't good enough for us to repeat every day to the front page of every social media in USA (which would then be covered by traditional media about how people are repeating), we treat Malala from Swat Valley as if her 2013 book isn't good enough for us. The banality of evil is that billionaires own sports teams and media empires (including Disney and Mecca media theme parks) - and we are addicted to the content creation. We do not want to face up to egoism problems (or use the word egomania for Trump and Putin) [that MLK Jr. was correct in year 1954 and every year since 1954](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) has proven the problem. :::===

"They're floating a lot of ideas and seeing what sticks. Another person on Newsmax claimed 5 years is "more than enough" for her crimes, and compared it to cutting deals with mafia killers. Except we do that when their testimony is able to put those people away - nothing Maxwell claims will hold up in court. The defense would prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that she is an unreliable witness due to frequent documented lies in court.

All she can do is name names to start an investigation. None of that rises to the level of pardon worthy, but if she names Dems and claims Trump wasn't part of it, they'll reward her like she just got every pedo convicted. It doesn't matter if it's true or not, they'll reward her. And if the truth is that Trump IS a former Epstein client (not just acquaintance)? They'd punish her for telling that truth and demonize her forevermore.

Her crimes are well known, and her facilitation of child abuse and rape is beyond a doubt known. The volume of her crimes, along with the sheer length of time committing them, shows that it was purposeful and not some fluke in the moment mistake, and she's never once shown actual remorse. She should never be up for early release, let alone pardons."

You use the leverage you have from one person to financially enable other businesses, get clean people involved, enact other scenarios and prepare to capture further compromising materials on new people, rise and repeat.

It's really shocking to consider but it makes sense. Jeffrey ran the most prominent honeypot operation in History."

"Epstein didn’t “weasel his way in” to Victorias Secret. He was hired as Les Wexner’s financial advisor in 1987. In July 1991, Wexner granted Epstein power of attorney and instated him as a trustee on the board of the  Wexner Foundation.

Les Wexler didn’t just own Victorias Secret. He also owned Lerner’s, The Limited, Henri Bedel, White Barn Candle, Lane Bryant, Abercrombie and Fitch, Express, and Bath and Body Works. He also owns myriad smaller businesses like trucking companies.

He has managed to keep himself out of the spotlight despite appearing to be the only client of Jeffrey Epstein. He is a major donor and supporter of Israel. Is he Mossad? That’s a question nobody will answer, especially Wexner.

Some women sued Victoria’s Secret in 1990s because they say they were assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein (and one of the women included Ghislaine Maxwell in her lawsuit). Yet Wexner didn’t cut ties with Epstein until 18 months after Epstein was charged with sexual molestation of a minor in 2006/07.

I sincerely doubt a man with the business acumen of Les Wexner sat around and let Epstein “misappropriate vast sums of money.” Wexner is no somnolent old clueless heir to a fortune. He built his empire with some help from his parents, but he was the one who made a powerhouse of multiple complex companies, not his family. He’s a very smart guy. He has been extremely active over the years in philanthropy at Ohio State University and in Jewish philanthropies.

Wexner is no victim of Jeffrey Epstein anymore than Ghislaine Maxwell was. In 2012 CNN Money described Wexner as the longest serving CEO of a Fortune 500 company.He was on Harvard Business Review's Top 100 Best Performing CEOs in the World, ranked number 11 in 2015 and number 34 in 2016.

Though Wexner cut ties with Epstein in 2007, he didn’t claim Epstein misappropriated funds until 2019 in a letter he addressed to the Wexner Foundation when Epstein was jailed a second time, a few days before Epstein’s death. Funny it took this savvy businessman 12 years to discover/publicize this supposed fraud.

Wexner was Epstein’s financier, pure and simple. Without Wexner there would be no jets, no mansions, no island. Wexner was the top guy in this nest of spies. Epstein was the middle man doing the dirty work. It’s a story as old as time. Wexner will walk away unscathed,"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I enjoy this kind of long-form Reddit comment, but since year 2015 I have found that hostile agents weaponize the spam filters of the Reddit server-side to filter out important links. What is designed to prevent spam links ends up getting comments black-holed because the filters are manipulated by outsiders to Reddit (feeding in important topic links with spam junk and have the links blacklisted, a type of information attack). At minmum, since links may not work without the comment being unpublished, the person should cite some authors names on any of the sources for this information. Because it is this style and tone of communictions that people accept without fact-checking because the labor clearly went into the writing. But it really should not be published without citing a book author or article, ideally a link. Unique proose on social media is popular, but frankly, all these kinds of public topics that get repeated day after day would be far better on a Wiki style system with refined editing and links for citations. People are in a media frenzy on these topics, accurate information deserves citation. (the specific CNN reference is great) ===:::

"Epstein was a master manipulator and a con artist, but he was also a cog in a much bigger network that leads to much more powerful individuals. That person who he conned into getting his teaching job was the headmaster of the Dalton School, Donald Barr. Barr was an OSS officer operating in Europe during WW2 who worked HUMINT, and had a knack for funding the right people and getting them in the right place to extract intelligence. He was instrumental in getting a young Jewish resistance fighter working with British Intelligence into a position as official censor of all German newspapers in the postwar period. That person was Robert Maxwell, who would go on to build a publishing empire in England. Robert was the father of Ghislaine, and Donald was the father of former AG William Barr.

By all accounts it was Donald who found Epstein, not the other way around. Donald and Jeffrey also seemed to have similar interests; Donald Barr published a sci-fi novel called Space Relations, in which the protagonist travels to conduct negotiations on a slave planet, gets captured, becomes the property of a high society dominatrix. The two fall far each other and spend their days SAing teenaged girls together.

It's interesting that Donald Barr and Jeffery Epstein happened to find each other, no? And that is just one of the many connections linking Epstein to US, British, and Israeli intelligence, the Uber rich, and the politically connected."

A sense of vertigo before all this information. Well if theses like the ones that I just described that Baudrillard holds are true… But of course the word “true” will no longer apply, because we will be in a setting in which you won’t want the true, you will want the truer than true. You won’t even… The false won’t even be a good enough lie for you, you’ll want the lie better than a lie. I mean, the truer than true explanation. You won’t just want Oliver Stone‘s film about JFK. You’ll want the film about how Oliver Stone himself participated in the plot to cover up the real assassins by making the film JFK.
