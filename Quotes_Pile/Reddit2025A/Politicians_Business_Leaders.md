# If Only Politicians 
# If Only Business Leaders

We all know what a Wiki system is, like Wikipedia, and they are inexpensive - with conventions for translation of content in all world languages.

Why can't our politicians create a Wiki of their platform? Where every edit and change is logged, require identification of every assistant who edits.

Focus on linking ideas in a structure that has various levels of depth. If an interview with news media, update the Wiki with the promises made.

Allow anyone to download a complete copy of the data to keep copies so accusations of tampering.

Of course, not all content on Reddit is real, many of these are fake to appeal to popular sentiment. But some problems of social relationships are documented well enough in books and divorce cases and suicide cases that these behaviors are known.

"I dumped my girlfriend because she made a “test” Instagram story and I failed"

https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m223up/i_dumped_my_girlfriend_because_she_made_a_test/

I (26M) broke up with my girlfriend of 9 months yesterday because I’m apparently supposed to treat her Instagram like a job interview.

She posted a black screen to her story with the caption “some people really disappoint you lol.” No context. No explanation. Just that.

So I ignored it. Because I’m not a mind reader and I’m not going to play high school games. I assumed it was about one of her friends or just her being passive aggressive about work or whatever.

Well apparently that was a “test.” She told me I failed because I didn’t message her right away asking what was wrong. She said it showed I “don’t care enough to check in.”

I told her I don’t check Instagram every five minutes and if she has a problem with me she should act like an adult and talk to me instead of fishing for attention through vague stories. She said I was being cold and emotionally unavailable. I said she was being manipulative and immature.

She cried. I packed my stuff. She’s still messaging me telling me I’m heartless for leaving over “one small thing.” But it’s not one small thing. It’s the million little red flags I’ve ignored for too long. The tests. The mood swings. The social media drama. I’m not dating a puzzle I have to solve daily just to avoid a tantrum.

I want peace. Not stories written in invisible ink that I’m expected to decode while she sits there with her arms crossed waiting to see if I love her enough to notice.

Done. Blocked. Logged out. I feel like I can breathe again.

### "Packed my stuff", "leaving her"

So they were living together? 

First off, why must be block-happy with someone you lived with (and supposedly loved more than any other free and available person). None of this being described is toxic to that degree. It's shallow and superficial, but who teaches relationship behaviors - Hollywood fiction films that are just as hate-bait selling for money as fake Reddit social media content. Block-happy behavior shows a *red flag* in itself, a very popular behavior that is a USA society-wide red flag. 

* "We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

That block-happy behavior aside... the statement **"Not stories written in invisible ink that I’m expected to decode"** is what drew me to creating this page I am composing.

1. Why do people (commenting on Reddit, USA society) accept this style of social media content? Including the Reddit posting itself? "Not stories written in invisible ink that I’m expected to decode"

2. Why does the same idea and atttiude towards communications not apply to **President Donald Trump** and Vice President JD Vance, people "settle for" cryptic communications and promises and don't treat public communications standard as they would call out an intimate relationship. **"Not stories written in invisible ink that I’m expected to decode"**

3. Corporate America leaders and teams where personality and manipulation / "selling skills" lead to power at the top over clarity and mutuality in understanding. **"Not stories written in invisible ink that I’m expected to decode"**

In the era of Donald Trump as role model for all of society, do people even recognize that they flock to and seek out this very kind of cryptic manipulative communications in Donald Trump? "Not stories written in invisible ink that I’m expected to decode"?

What does this reveal about the parenting, marriages, relationships - that people in the USA for over a decade (since year 2014) have made Donald Trump the rising star and center of attention on every aspect of life?

Behaviors and communications that would be ***red flags*** and criticizes are put on the world stage as a role model of goodness and template of USA future leaders?

I think people have zero self-awareness that their public behaviors, including faith in hate upon Donald Trump, reflects their faith systems - that hate and dehumanization of "the enemy" is the very pattern of emotions and thinking being cultivated.

What would be considered unacceptable within a relationship of a 26 year old male is the very template role model of communications and future planning of an entire society.

Something is very wrong that people don't recognize what is being revealed by the addiction to hate and abuse that Donald Trump has been in years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025. And how people do not communicate openly about the emotional stress, loss of future goodness, confusion and bewilderment living in such a relationship with people in egomania and tripping on power and greed is like.

Why would you fuel and create an abusive father / Daddy figure and put them in dictator control of your life and not see it it as an abusive self-harm behavior like alcoholism and drug abuse? To view MAGA as manipulated and abused, no matter how much they *claim* it is "winning", at what point do people truly grasp how many years this pattern of abuse has been going on... 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and see that it is mass psychosis and group sickness of cults and mob mentality from people who have lost sense of what goodness itself means?

# Business Leaders

As if employees didn't witness this...

"This is making the front page of reddit in half a hour or so judging by the crazy engagement this post is getting, these two are royally fucked lol"

"They don't care until they get caught. No accountability, even at this age and status, is wild. Cut it off and pay the spousal support. Oh wait, he won't have a choice now, looool. Courts are gonna love this."

## Leaders

These are the personalities of leaders that people admire and flock to in year 2025. And the way social media society nation react-comments to these kind of leaders.

Manipulative personalities are embraced in business and politics. Maybe the proble is that the audience thinks it is LOL to see *other people* being manipulated and are self-harming the future and even the entire nation (JD Vance, Donald Trump, etc) by making it a sport to see others fail (MAGA fail is a very popular attitude of LOL in July 2025 USA society, that people manipulated and harmed by Rupert Murdoch, JD Vance, Donald Trump, etc - it is good for the future of USA that nobody is taeching remedial morality of good fromband and helping them see all the *red flags* in the relationships they have with leaders in business and government and news media systems).

## USA child born year 2002

A child born in year 2002 would be age ten in [November 2012 when Donald Trump instructed Cambridge Analytica and Russia to manipulate all the hearts and minds of USA people](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446). They in year 2025 will be 23 years old, having lived under Donald Trump's rise and constant parent role model from age 10 to 23. What kind of parents made Donald Trump a role model and status symbol for leadership? What kind of parents think Fox News / Rupert Murdoch is good for future of their children as learnng and education source?

The ***red flags*** people have in intimate relatonships should be applied to the behavior in establishing status symbols, leaders.
