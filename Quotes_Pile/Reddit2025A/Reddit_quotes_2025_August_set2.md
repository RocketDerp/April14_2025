"It won’t change until we riot in the streets. Euro style. You want attention you gain it. One person complaining is a complainer. Everyone complaining is a problem."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA changed society without rioting in the streets. Middle East has violence and terrorism in the streets for thousands of years as each group of fiction mythology storytelling addicts consumes different interpretations of events and attacks the gentiles, non-believers, infidels. USA has let QAnon and MAGA adopt fiction news (Fox News, Newsmax, QAnon, memes, junk social media, clickbait fantasy). Donald Trump thrives off the idea that science is bad. That reason thinking is bad. And that poorly thought out actions are good, like riots in the street (mindless action is not educatiion and teaching). People are likely going to die in USA saving the Pizzagate QAnon children from the QAnon fantasy ideas and Donald Trump fantasy fiction. Think real hard about the role Fox News has played in educating adults, in the role Reddit and Bluesky and Twitter an Facebook has played in educating adults. Riots are a step away from education and teaching, anti-progress. One-line Twitter-thinking is Donald Trump's power,and this Reddit comment (popular upvoted) is the source of the problems of MAGA. Anti-education, anti-comprehension, anti-learning. ===:::

"Still wouldn't make the maggats change their mind. They'd just tell you how it was fake and corrupt and everyone is I ut to get him cause he's such an amazing patriot and we only hate him because he's a republican. They are *not* serious people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : They are media addicts who think Fox News is serious nonfiction. Who can't distinguish fiction from nonfiction and consume entirely different media. Social media created Trump, Russia won an information war. Surkov won, Putin won. People change their mind constantly "Still wouldn't make the maggats change their mind" - but people are choosing anti-reality, fiction, not seeking science and nonfiction mind changes. ===:::

"Unfortunately, that's not the whole ball game. People act like Trump didn't try and cause an insurrection while president. We don't need any more crimes. The crimes that are already a fact are enough. We need accountability, we need the government to do it's job, I mean Trump has 34 felony convictions, and he's president. Who cares if he also diddled kids? When I meet criminals I don't try and rank them. They do that in prison, that's where Trump is supposed to be."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : EXACTLY. The insurection January 6, 2021 was the tine for social media to stand up and stop entertainment and become serious about QAnon cults. Jen Senko's March 2016 film about Fox News and other fiction-based media running politics. SOLID EVIDENCE in front of EVERYONE was presented on January 6, 2021. We The People did not stand up and halt entertainment and mocking and sustain serious nonfiction important topics. Social media did not stop entertainment during the 2 Trump Impeachment either, people are far too addicted to using social media to mock and insult Trump that they aren't REMOVING Donald Trump. His Tony Clifton act compusively glues the audience into reactions, feedback loops. ===:::

"If none of the victims consider a more "personal" way to seek retribution from the perpetrators, maybe modeled after a recent health insurance denial "feedback", then the rest is all the same, with nothing to be learned or to be changed - just social media noise."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : January 6, 2021 was "social media noise" from November 2020. This fantasy of society of putting shitleaders at the top to them murder them. Instead of using social media to reform society, it is full of ficiton and action content with lists. Intelligent and good people don't elect terribleladers inthe first place. Social media has dragged the USA down, Russia invaded social media with shit ideas like this - QAnon to MAGA poetry of bullshit. Americans need to face up to their attraction to terrible leaders and fiction. Not just MAGA,not just Republicans,lost to Putin'sinformationwar since March 2013. To seriously act like gun-stroking MAGA isn't ready to shoot and murder "liberals" that they disagree with is denial of how much pro-violence (only against Ameircians, not NATO against Russia) media messages are being fed by Russia to ALL Americans. ===:::

"This is what MAGA voters want. They want smart people to leave. They don't like intellectuals. They feel inferior and lack the ability or will to improve themselves so they just want to lower the bar so that they can feel superior.

They don't realize that what makes America a powerful and modern nation are the intelligent class. Don't get me wrong. Farmers, mechanics, factory workers, etc. all play a vital role in keeping our society functioning.

However, what makes our economy grow and stronger (and really all developed nations) are the intellectuals. They are creating new economic sectors and expanding them. This is why you see nations invest so heavily in education. It is one of the reasons Japan went from being a poorish country to the economic powerhouse it is now during the Meiji Restoration. Or Singapore going from a poor fishing village to one of the richest cities in the world. Or South Korea being one of the poorest countries on the planet in the 50s to one of the richest.

If America divests in its intellectual class, it will decline over time and other countries will surpass us.

People need to learn their place in society. The intellectual class weren't necessarily born intellectual. They put work into it. Getting a Ph.D. in micro biology isn't a walk in the park. It is a lot of hard work. You can't just say that you lived enough years on this planet so you are on the same tier as these people. You have to put in the effort"

"They think its soooooo clever that they are 'turning the joke around" but in the end, all they are doing is drawing more eyeballs to those episodes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Not a soul in USA comprehends how Surkovian governing works. The White House + Kremlin does absurd surreal antics to *create audience reactions*, just like Tony Clifton interacts with the audience. The eyeballs are gong to Trump and I.C.E. The entire point is to be a hate magnet. Hate is the very core of I.C.E. and Donald Trump, and has been for decades now. The Surkovian technique turns every person in USA to hate upon Americans. A hates B, B hates C, C hates A and other even more complicated friendly-fire Americans Hate Americans (Americans hate Canadians in year 2025), etc. Russian information warfare and Cambridge Analytica mind-fuck have to be DIRECTLY educated and ADDRESSED and people learn the timelines and re-gain perspective of these patterns! South Park is amplifying the White House, we can not use conventional thinking, we all (age 12 to age 120) have to grasp media ecology at the James Joyce Finnegans Wake level / Marshall McLuhan level / Hannah Arendt level / Neil Postman level / Vladislav Surkov level / Peter Pomerantsev level / Adam Curtis level. You have to look at the year 2012 onward NATO / Ukraine vs. Russia forrest and not just August 2025 I.C.E. with South Park trees.

"Matt, Trey and the South Park writing team are geniuses. How often do you get to experience jokes at someone else’s expense and those same people being made fun of keep making the jokes funnier by pretending they’re in on the joke?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This audience reaction, this Reddit comment, is [Surkovian Onion Eating, not grasping that the whole pont of antics politics](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) is to create South Park, Reddit, Bluesky, MSNBC, reactions. That's how Surkov governing works, how Tony Clifton audience interaction works scaled up to a world-wide-web Internet level. "keep making the jokes funnier by pretending they’re in on the joke?" - they are not PRETENDING, I.C.E. is absurd surreal comedy - Rality TV action drama. The whole point is to run the nation like a fiction Reality TV show - because that is what Putin and Surkov discovered 25 years ago is the means to concentrate power and wealth. The audience thinks they are out-smarting Surkov, but no, the KGB / FSB / Surkovian students have defeated the USA and there is zero self-awareness in USA of how this works. Social media users are PRETENDING, this is all fiction content. The I.C.E. budget is all about spectacle and content creation. The underlying aim is not to get rid of immigrants, to to create an impossible to win conflict with paradoxes. War against Canadians, War against Mexicans, War against Humanism. ["A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are.

"Between Trumps continued breaking of the law, as well as his attempt to retain power by force in 2021, I don't think it matters what the legality is. Trump will not leave the White House outside of a coffin, he has ICE as a personal army, a history of facing no consequences for breaking the law, and is in the process of tearing chunks out of the constitution.

Even if he is forced out of power, he is stuffing so many cronies into office, that you'd need to clean house to avoid him acting like he's president still."

"No amount of intelligence is going to make you immune to propaganda. You might be exposed to an idea repeatedly on social media that doesn't sound incorrect on its face and which you never bother to verify, you might be given a piece of information from someone you trust which you never bother to verify, you might have a flaw somewhere in your worldview or knowledge base that you've accepted as true for so long that it's difficult to challenge, et cetera.

Right now, our entire society is being flooded with corporate propaganda that "AI" is the solution to all our problems, the next step forward in technology, the leap that will make countless fields obsolete the way the car made horse-drawn carriages obsolete. You and I may understand that's not actually what it is, but there was a time when I didn't yet know how LLMs worked - was I stupid then? Did I magically become smart once I learned? I still don't fully understand it, anyways.

I know it's comforting to believe you're simply too smart to ever fall for anything, but the reality is being an intelligent person doesn't mean you have an internal lie detector that can see through bullshit with 100% accuracy. You have to be willing to believe that some of your own beliefs are wrong in order to change them, to be willing to understand that people will take advantage of your wants and needs to manipulate you, and be willing to accept that some people will abuse your trust.

Being a victim of manipulation doesn't make you stupid, it makes you human, just like everyone else."

"I’ve learned to read personality traits in my 35 years being self employed and hiring dozens and dozens of people over the years… the 1 constant I ran into was a personality that on the surface seems great, but really is the opposite. An example is that any employee when just interviewing them in a informal way , would inevitably get around to say things like “ don’t worry, I don’t steal stuff” or “ im big on honesty so just don’t lie to me cause it’s not how I like to be treated”… and it only takes about a month before these types show their true colors and steal and lie like crazy, then blame me for them having to do it. Most people believe they are judged with the best intentions if you ask them. But the reality is a person judges you by how THEY would respond or react. If they steal, they assume you must steal as well, otherwise they have to face their own shortcomings. It’s just easier to believe that others are as just as untrustworthy as they are because that’s how they really see the world."

"I agree with both of you, Trump will never care but his constituents can still be broken down. Not all of them, most of them are the type to wear adult diapers merely in an attempt to "trigger liberals", but it's still important since American Christians support the right so strongly but actual Christian and biblical teachings have been so mutated to fit American Brand Christianity."

"No, youtube, Spotify, certain parts of Reddit and other social media, news stories, protests. Certain health subjects such as LGBTQ+, suicide, eating disorders, etc…

I even heard they are or already have, gone after TV channels like channel 4. But you’d have to as a UK resident on that one."

"Across the world really. Global conservatism massively on the rise in the past decade. Voter apathy and misinformation are a big part of the cause."

"Inciting violence is not just "Facebook posts"

In the same way that someone would be arrested if they posted indecent images of under 18s on Facebook, trying to ask people to assault and harm others is a crime, even if it's posted on social media"

"It's like we are living in two realities in this country. I think most of the country has forgotten there even were political assassinations this year. Short attention spans, and news coverage chasing the latest thing."

"I’m ashamed to say how shocked I am that the media absolutely buried this story. The media has helped create this dystopian nightmare. And they continue to feed the nightmare machine."

"All of these users of automated plagiarism softwares seem stuck in perpetual "Gotcha!" mode, stunningly unaware that they are basically taking a thousand pics of themselves caught with their pants down.

They are constantly walking around with a big neon sign "I'm a tool and I don't have any grasp of basic ethics".

I'm sorry this happened to you, OP, this is bullshit."
