"It wonâ€™t change until we riot in the streets. Euro style. You want attention you gain it. One person complaining is a complainer. Everyone complaining is a problem."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA changed society without rioting in the streets. Middle East has violence and terrorism in the streets for thousands of years as each gorup of fiction mythology storytelling addicts consumes different interpretations of events and attacks the gentiles, non-believers, infidels. USA has let QAnon and MAGA adopt fiction news (Fox News, Newsmax, QAnon, memes, junk social media, clickbait fantasy). Donald Trump thrives off the idea that science is bad. That reason thinking is bad. And that poorly thought out actions are good, like riotsin the street (mindless action is not educatiion and teaching). People are likely going to die in USA saving the Pizzagate QAnon childern from the QAnon fantasy ideas and Donald Trump fantasy fiction. Think real hard about the role Fox News has played in educating adults, in the role Reddit and Bluesky and Twitter an Facebook has played in educating adults. Riots are a step away from education and teaching, anti-progress. One-line Twitter-thinking is Donald Trump's power,and this Reddit comment (popular upvoted) is the source of the problems of MAGA. Anti-education, anti-comprehension, anti-learning. ===:::

"Yeah, they latch onto whatever new talking point gets thrown out there. Pretty predictable at this point"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The White House is being run like a Reality TV show, Surkovian governing. Media addiction drives the nation. Turth and goodness have been abandoned in favor of "Q Drops" kind of information strip tease (fiction). ===:::

"Still wouldn't make the maggats change their mind. They'd just tell you how it was fake and corrupt and everyone is I ut to get him cause he's such an amazing patriot and we only hate him because he's a republican. They are *not* serious people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : They are media addicts who think Fox News is serious nonfiction. Who can't distinguish fiction from nonfiction and consume entirely different media. Social media created Trump, Russia won an information war. Surkov won, Putin won. People change their mind constantly "Still wouldn't make the maggats change their mind" - but people are choosing anti-reality, fiction, not seeking science and nonfiction mind changes. ===:::

"Unfortunately, that's not the whole ball game. People act like Trump didn't try and cause an insurrection while president. We don't need any more crimes. The crimes that are already a fact are enough. We need accountability, we need the government to do it's job, I mean Trump has 34 felony convictions, and he's president. Who cares if he also diddled kids? When I meet criminals I don't try and rank them. They do that in prison, that's where Trump is supposed to be."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : EXACTLY. The insurection January 6, 2021 was the tine for social media to stand up and stop entertainment and become serious about QAnon cults. Jen Senko's March 2016 film about Fox News and other fiction-based media running politics. SOLID EVIDENCE in front of EVERYONE was presented on January 6, 2021. We The People did not stand up and halt entertainment and mocking and sustain serious nonfiction important topics. Social media did not stop entertainment during the 2 Trump Impeachment either, people are far too addicted to using social media to mock and insult Trump that they aren't REMOVING Donald Trump. His Tony Clifton act compusively glues the audience into reactions, feedback loops. ===:::
