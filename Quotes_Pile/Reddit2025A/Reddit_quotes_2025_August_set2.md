"It won’t change until we riot in the streets. Euro style. You want attention you gain it. One person complaining is a complainer. Everyone complaining is a problem."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA changed society without rioting in the streets. Middle East has violence and terrorism in the streets for thousands of years as each group of fiction mythology storytelling addicts consumes different interpretations of events and attacks the gentiles, non-believers, infidels. USA has let QAnon and MAGA adopt fiction news (Fox News, Newsmax, QAnon, memes, junk social media, clickbait fantasy). Donald Trump thrives off the idea that science is bad. That reason thinking is bad. And that poorly thought out actions are good, like riotsin the street (mindless action is not educatiion and teaching). People are likely going to die in USA saving the Pizzagate QAnon children from the QAnon fantasy ideas and Donald Trump fantasy fiction. Think real hard about the role Fox News has played in educating adults, in the role Reddit and Bluesky and Twitter an Facebook has played in educating adults. Riots are a step away from education and teaching, anti-progress. One-line Twitter-thinking is Donald Trump's power,and this Reddit comment (popular upvoted) is the source of the problems of MAGA. Anti-education, anti-comprehension, anti-learning. ===:::

"Yeah, they latch onto whatever new talking point gets thrown out there. Pretty predictable at this point"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The White House is being run like a Reality TV show, Surkovian governing. Media addiction drives the nation. Turth and goodness have been abandoned in favor of "Q Drops" kind of information strip tease (fiction). ===:::

"Still wouldn't make the maggats change their mind. They'd just tell you how it was fake and corrupt and everyone is I ut to get him cause he's such an amazing patriot and we only hate him because he's a republican. They are *not* serious people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : They are media addicts who think Fox News is serious nonfiction. Who can't distinguish fiction from nonfiction and consume entirely different media. Social media created Trump, Russia won an information war. Surkov won, Putin won. People change their mind constantly "Still wouldn't make the maggats change their mind" - but people are choosing anti-reality, fiction, not seeking science and nonfiction mind changes. ===:::

"Unfortunately, that's not the whole ball game. People act like Trump didn't try and cause an insurrection while president. We don't need any more crimes. The crimes that are already a fact are enough. We need accountability, we need the government to do it's job, I mean Trump has 34 felony convictions, and he's president. Who cares if he also diddled kids? When I meet criminals I don't try and rank them. They do that in prison, that's where Trump is supposed to be."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : EXACTLY. The insurection January 6, 2021 was the tine for social media to stand up and stop entertainment and become serious about QAnon cults. Jen Senko's March 2016 film about Fox News and other fiction-based media running politics. SOLID EVIDENCE in front of EVERYONE was presented on January 6, 2021. We The People did not stand up and halt entertainment and mocking and sustain serious nonfiction important topics. Social media did not stop entertainment during the 2 Trump Impeachment either, people are far too addicted to using social media to mock and insult Trump that they aren't REMOVING Donald Trump. His Tony Clifton act compusively glues the audience into reactions, feedback loops. ===:::

"If none of the victims consider a more "personal" way to seek retribution from the perpetrators, maybe modeled after a recent health insurance denial "feedback", then the rest is all the same, with nothing to be learned or to be changed - just social media noise."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : January 6, 2021 was "social media noise" from November 2020. This fantasy of society of putting shitleaders at the top to them murder them. Instead of using social media to reform society, it is full of ficiton and action content with lists. Intelligent and good people don't elect terribleladers inthe first place. Social media has dragged the USA down, Russia invaded social media with shit ideas like this - QAnon to MAGA poetry of bullshit. Americans need to face up to their attraction to terrible leaders and fiction. Not just MAGA,not just Republicans,lost to Putin'sinformationwar since March 2013. To seriously act like gun-stroking MAGA isn't ready to shoot and murder "liberals" that they disagree with is denial of how much pro-violence (only against Ameircians, not NATO against Russia) media messages are being fed by Russia to ALL Americans. ===:::

"This is what MAGA voters want. They want smart people to leave. They don't like intellectuals. They feel inferior and lack the ability or will to improve themselves so they just want to lower the bar so that they can feel superior.

They don't realize that what makes America a powerful and modern nation are the intelligent class. Don't get me wrong. Farmers, mechanics, factory workers, etc. all play a vital role in keeping our society functioning.

However, what makes our economy grow and stronger (and really all developed nations) are the intellectuals. They are creating new economic sectors and expanding them. This is why you see nations invest so heavily in education. It is one of the reasons Japan went from being a poorish country to the economic powerhouse it is now during the Meiji Restoration. Or Singapore going from a poor fishing village to one of the richest cities in the world. Or South Korea being one of the poorest countries on the planet in the 50s to one of the richest.

If America divests in its intellectual class, it will decline over time and other countries will surpass us.

People need to learn their place in society. The intellectual class weren't necessarily born intellectual. They put work into it. Getting a Ph.D. in micro biology isn't a walk in the park. It is a lot of hard work. You can't just say that you lived enough years on this planet so you are on the same tier as these people. You have to put in the effort"

"And then we have the other other issue of a huge increase in fake scientific papers being published by groups just draining funding from investors, producing nothing of value and paying people to sign it off. Greed is once again destroying progress."

"The US is entering the second dark age."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Once a society goes fiction, you can fabricate reality on any topic. Not only medical health. Addiction to fiction is the dark ages.

"It’s the entire essence of fake news. Nothing is real unless he says so, the rest is fake. And that started a decade ago now."
