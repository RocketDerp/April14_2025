# Systemic Comment Culture of Reddit

In general, regarding peer to peer commenting:

1. You will be banned for criticizing another peer commenting user for replying to you.
  
3. What you are SUPPOSED to do is "report" the comment to the moderators and owners, and let THEM criticize the person that replied to you. Report insults and attacks to the "secret police" moderators / owners who operate with I.C.E. face-masks against the person you "reported" for reply. You are not to call out bullying, call out artifical intelligence claims - you are to telephone 911 secret police with the report button.

4. Admins / Owners of the site silence / remove / suspend / ban users who criticize other users for their morality. In peer to peer commenting.

5. Suspending / silencing users is done in secret police / reporting to secret Reddit admin police fashion.

6. Artificial intelligence in year 2025 is suspending users when detecting back and forth criticism being reported as "harrasment". A tactic of information warfare, the reporting itself.

7. A culture of fear and anxiety that the secret police will ban you when other users abuse the "report" button to draw attention to your standing up to bully / calling out the frequency of public attack replies / calling out the low-effort noise reply comments to serious topics / important non-joke topics. Because you are supposed to NOT call-out other comment replies - you are supposed to speed-dial 911 the secret Reddit police to "deal with" the problems for you. Not critize the reply comments attacking you. Which if **you don't agree with how the Reddit I.C.E. secret police (face masked) operate** in secret... you end up having to just be silent and neither report the banality / noise / joke (on a Gaza topic of children starvation, I quoted a nonfiction book,and I got a "Sir, this is a Wendy's" comment nosie attack). Systemic joke-washing informaiton warfare. But I think the I.C.E. secret police moderation culture does not PUBICALY, unmaksed in public, stand up to the information warfare tactics. So I don't report it to the secret Reddit 911 police.

8. "Do not feed the trolls" is taken as perfect, always correct, blind faith. Unquestioned faith. That goes back decades on the Internet and should never ever be questioned.

9. "Do not feed the trolls" is now: "report people to the I.C.E. 911 Reddit secret police and have them disappeared". That is how people "do not feed the trolls", by feeding the Trump-controlled / White House / NSA / media owners of Reddit corporation - secret police **DO FEED THE SECRET POLICE WHO DISAPPEAR REDDIT USERS**. That's where "do not feed the trolls" has lead to.

Ok, it is Reddit's bar and grill, tavern, they (Corporate America under Trump "the media" behind the company direction) can have their own rules on how patrons interact with each other. Even if the rules are not very good. Private ownership with Donald Trump White House direting media corporations. Elon Musk directing media corporations. Private system, private laws of secret police / policy.

But that's not the even deeper reason I created this GitHub page on the topic.

Because there is another aspect of Reddit commenting culture:

1. Posting of news stories and screen shots of persons OFF of Reddit. Such as on /r/LeopardsAtMyFace or such as /r/Politics about Elon Musk or JD Vance

2. Comments about the held-up target / the posting subject.

3. Sometimes comments about a person mentioned / group mentioned that is not the posting subject. Such as the posting being about JD Vance, but the someone in the comment brings up Donald Trump (who is not mentionedin the posting in this example)

4. The idea of discussing people that are NOT in the commenting. But are the "target" or "topic" of the commenting.

5. Reddit becomes like Iran and Yemen where public people get togehter and all hate upon an outside nation - Israel and USA. A hate-mongering, anti-goodness, anti-comprehension, anti-Malala, anti-education, anti-teaching hate rally / hate *normalization* rituals.  https://combatantisemitism.org/cam-news/weaponizing-hate-how-pro-iran-protests-are-inciting-global-antisemitism/

That is when this aspect of Reddit commenting culture comes out:

1. "Piece of shit"

2. "Non human, terrible, they deserve hate", "hate thy enemy", "hate all people in that group", "hate will improve that nation if we all join together on Reddit and hate them very hard"

3. Dehumanization, mocking, insulting of the target person being discussed that is not on Reddit.

4. Not thoughtful criticism, but ginned up hate. Hate mongering.

It is criticism of this behavior of society, this prizing of hate / prizing of dehumanization / organized bullying / prizing of mobmentality - that will get you banned if you reply to a comment criticizing such attitudes. Reddit commenting becomes a dehumanization mind programming training camp. A terrorism training camp agaonst USA people. Not to seek out undertanding, but to call humans as non-human "pieces of shit" who "deserve" negative outcomes. Not an attiude of "we can do better" as a human spcies, but an attitude of hate for hate. Hate vs. hate. Prizing hate. Ginning up hate.

It is a culture where lust for high-speed messaging communicats to create mob mentality of love the touch device for power to hate human persons.

This distiction between the peer to peer commenting "harrasment" and bullying and "ginning up" hate mongering,prizing hate... is redirected towawrds people not actually in the commenting section.

It is a toxic culure, hate breeder reactor, reactionary training mindset. And people practice it like reliigion prayer, over and over commenting how improtant it is to hate, on every topic posting. It becomes habit, routine, practices, over and over.

That is what Reddit has done to USA society regarding politics. Group A hate group B, group B hates group C, group C hates gorup A, on and on in patterns of circulur hate prizing. A united common faith of *hate thy enemy*, *hate thy neighbor*.

A culture of postig conteent and creating comments to gin up hate. A school of hate. A teachng center of anti-goodness. A teaching center of how powerful hate and dehumanization and deporting and disapeparin gpeople is - and how great it is that you hate *the other people* who "get what they deserve" of hate and "fuck around and find out" revenge /lessons / payback. Prizing hate. Prizing mob mentality training camp.

## My Systemic concern, Surkovian

Reddit wasn't like this before year 2014. The Internet Research Agency of Russia / Moscow organization was opened in year 2013.

&nbsp;

"would go on to call the Fifth World War. The first nonlinear war of all against all. Which is a description by Vladislav Surkov, who sort of the ennui ??? of Russian politics, of the current (year 2014) war around Ukraine. um, so, I started working in Russian TV"

video clip: https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxGLMkhbMgSwzWeQK7xYIBJ-nxn_UlzOdZ     
Video was published December 5, 2014 describing the past, what was already going on in December 2014.

Today is December 4, 2025. I haven't forgotten this Youtube publication December 5. ELEVEN YEARS AGO. And how things were NOT THIS WAY before the Internet Research Agency seeded out-group hate patterns on Reddit.
