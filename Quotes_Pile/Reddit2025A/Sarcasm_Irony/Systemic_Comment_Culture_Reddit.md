# Systemic Comment Culture of Reddit

In general, regarding peer to peer commenting:

1. You will be banned for criticizing another peer commenting user for replying to you.

2. Admins / Ownersof the site silence / remove / suspend / ban users who criticize other users for their morality. In peer to peer commenting.

3. Suspending / silencing users is done in secret police / reporting to secret Reddit admin police fashion.

4. Artificial intelligence in year 2025 is suspending users when detecting back and forth criticism being reported as "harrasment". A tactic of information warfare, the reporting itself.

Ok,, it is Reddit's bar and grill,tavern, they can have their own rules on how patrons interact with each other. Even if the rules are not very good.

But that's not the reason I created this GitHub page on the topic.

Because there is another aspect of commenting culture:

1. Posting of news stories and screen shots of persons OFF of Reddit. Such as on /r/LeopardsAtMyFace or such as /r/Politics about Elon Musk or JD Vance

2. Comments about the held-up target / the posting subject.

3. Sometimes comments about a person mentioned / group mentioned that is not the posting subject. Such as the posting being about JD Vance, but the someone in the comment brings up Donald Trump (who is not mentionedin the posting in this example)

4. The idea of discussing people that are NOT in the commenting. But are the "target" or "topic"fo the commenting.

That is when this aspect of Reddit commenting culture comes out:

1. "Piece of shit"

2. "Non human, terrible, they deserve hate", "hate thy enemy", "hate all people in that group", "hate will improve that nation if we all join together on Reddit and hate them very hard"

3. Dehumanization, mocking, insulting of the target person being discussed that is not on Reddit.

4. Not thoughtful criticism, but ginned up hate. Hate mongering.

It is criticism of this behavior of society, this prizing of hate / prizing of dehumanization. It becomes a dehumanization mind programming training camp. A terrorism training camp agaonst USA people. Not to seek out undertanding, but to call humans as non-human "pieces of shit" who "deserve" negative outcomes.

It is a culture where lust for high-speed messaging communicats to create mob mentality of love the touch device for power to hate human persons.

This distiction between the peer to peer commenting "harrasment" and bullying and "ginning up" hate mongering,prizing hate... is redirected towawrds people not actually in the commenting section.

It is a toxic culure, hate breeder reactor, reactionary training mindset. And people practice it like reliigion prayer, over and over commenting how improtant it is to hate, on every topic posting. It becomes habit, routine, practices, over and over.

That is what Reddit has done to USA society regarding politics. Group A hate group B, group B hates group C, group C hates gorup A, on and on in patterns of circulur hate prizing. A united common faith of *hate thy enemy*, *hate thy neighbor*.

A culture of postig conteent and creating comments to gin up hate.
