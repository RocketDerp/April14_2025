Mocking away at the enemy. The other political party. Not asserting truth and goodness, just insulting the egoism in Reddit "better than her" egoism. A pecking order of egoism vs. egoism of media consumers about the sex acts of billionares on private jets and private islands. Not the Reddit frame (Medium is the MassAge) of "MURDERED BY WORDS!", we killed Nacy Mace, murder Nacy Mace, come watch the murder!

Contradictory Vaudeville uncited by Reddit audience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9_L9GRRsQo . Surreal / Absurd mental inversions are identified but no concern to defend against them and describe the historical outcomes of this portion of the human brain being systematically exploited by Russia and clergy. https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

Self-own! Murdered by words! Endless mockery of the seriousness of people being attracted to this surreal entertainment factor of RFK Jr / Surkov Russian governing technique / Kremlin information warfare of absurd surreal communications and contradiction.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1n9wwzt/how_to_selfown/

Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of NeiL Postamn's 1985 book "Amsuing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We aare drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech ddescribes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

Clowin images, Trump playing Tony Clifton clown acts. And a social media society that entirely will not become serious about QAnon / IRA / Cambridge Analytica and how the rich have weaponized absurd surreal amusement mind exploits.     
https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1na2e7s/trumps_ever_changing_story/

More eatign the Surkov onions. No matter how extremely absurd and surreal, nobody can call out Surkov techniques by name. Despite BBC coverage.   
https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1na04ds/who_actually_believes_this/

Front page of Reddit. The blind deep faith... that *turning into the wipeout* will save the USA. For over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, endless faith that more satire and more absurd will address the Surkov public relations techniques, Russian information warfare. That *reality and nonfiction* can be re-asserted with more creative fiction bullshit.

Humor-washing, LOL-washing, amusement-washing the situation. Constantly promoting that Donald Trump White House / FBI / federal in 2025 is entertainming and thrilling content just like popular baseball sports topics.     
https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1na3wqw/mike_johnson_just_announced_that_this_woman_stole/

&nbsp;

Fiction TV "Columbo" content in White House image with Trump. And describing paradox. But completely unable to articulate that paradox / surreal / absurd is Russian information warfare. Ameicans eat this paradox mind-fucking shit up.

A fake picture of Donald Trump, entertainment fixation of America, on front page of Reddit.   
Trump doesn't produce enough fiction entertainment for USA media addicts, so people create their own fan ficiton of Donald Trump. Media addiction runs USA society, and Trump is the addiction We The People have.    
https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1ncgwqp/this_is_solid_work/

&nbsp;

Front page of Reddit: "Donald Trump has no moral compass" - you have to be BLIND to not see that Trump is attracted to fiction. Trump's moral compass points to: **fiction, badness itself**. If We The People think Trump just blindly finds service to Putin... We The People completely do not grasp Surkov techniques of Kremlin year 2011. Donald Trump is not directinless / meandering. He is doing agressive marching in pro-Russia direction since March 2013!        
https://old.reddit.com/r/NoShitSherlock/comments/1ncicgm/crockett_he_trump_doesnt_have_a_moral_compass_why/

Media addicts of America cheer on every Donald Trump media content topic. We The People entirely unable to resist the antics politics, symbolism, status symbol, POTUS icon. Endless parade of trash media content mockery in a national policy of Toatl Mockery governing. Surkov won, Russia won since March 2013.

Reddit fiction addicts can't face up that Trump is fiction, Fox News is fiction, Bible is fiction, etc. We have a massive media ecology problem, defined in "Amusing Ourselves to Death" book published in 1985.

Front page of Reddit, 3 words **"more of this"** (Bluesky embed) message - and what *this* is? Pizzagate / QAnon / Epstein private jet / rich white men in private jet sex acts media stimulation. **Social media, Reddit, is not calling for removal of Donald Trump from office - an end to fiction-driven antics politics*** - social media is calling for more Epstein sex content of the lifestyles of the rich and famous entertainment. Not calling for more women to speak up against absuers on social media, but alling for more about the [magical list that was TEASED by Donald Trump Jr. before the 2024 elections.

Entertaiment-washing of murder and killing. As if people who cheer on gun killings don't get their own. As people who promote mock thy enemy don't get mocked. As if people who don't promote *hate thy enemy* don't get hated. Russia won an informaiton war since March 2013 to make Americans hate Americans and nobody is resisting (teaching about, educating, able to describe in any meaningful detail that demonstrates comprehension) Putin's informaiotn warfare. People are eating up Russia's hate. As long as there are humans to keep hating, out-group hate patterns are cheered on.         https://old.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/1ndprw8/mrw_a_racist_bigot_get_a_taste_of_his_own_medicine/

"See what they're trying to do?

This rhetoric doesn't benefit conservatives, and it doesn't benefit liberals, all it does is stir up more hatred and division. The only ones who benefit from this sort of thing are the powers out there who oppose America.

Do not fall for this unfortunately extremely effective propaganda."
