Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We are drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech describes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

The irony, the paradox, the contradiction. Reddit eats this up. A fiction media content creator, Charlie Kirk, was murdered. So fiction content creator leaders chime in.

"Irony" on front page of Reddit. Nobody discussing that the NRA was documented to have worked with / infiltrated by Russia in information war. That Russia manipulated anti-vaccination. USA has had ass kicked in information war documented by multiple NATO nations, and all people can do is hate upon the mentally injured and manipulated that Putin won. That's exactly what the information warfare conditioned: Americans hate upon Americans and avoid Russia learning / avoid studying information warfare (and media ecology) itself.    
https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1nekk60/the_irony/

And another "Irony" active irony poisoning posting. Wrapping fiction The Simpsons surreal absurd mind exploits around a murder. Kicking the MAGA community while they are down. Anti-compassion, anti-education, anti-teaching. Cheering that Russia keeps winning the information war since year 2013. The war against nonfiction, war against Reality as described September 9, 2014. Social media addicts ar thrilled to have Trump / MAGA antics to constantly mock and call ironic and be sarcastic about. Normal healthy scientific thinking and leadership of society is considered boring and unattractive.

Charlie Kirk is a media cult, Fox News is a media cult, Reddit is a media cult, Twitter (Elon Musk) is a media cult, Truth Social is a media cult, The Bible is a media cult!

Yet, people aren't taking the crisis seriously and recognizing that the very power of Putin Kremlin and Trump White House is build on constantly mentally overloading / over-stressing the information intake of We The People.  No defense has been found against Surkovian governing techniques, Putin has been in power for 25 years using these techniques on domestic Russia!

ONLY the mainstream media. Reddit has been around since middle of year 2005, more than two decades. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit since year 2013, and people message that it is the *mainstream* media ONLY. Truth Social is owned by Donald Trump / Elon Musk owns Twitter - the richest man in the world with the media platform (Twitter) that all other media systems quote and screenshot. People don't even question how Bluesky is funded and who is behind it. The Reddit owners don't post public warnings of IRA Kremlin activities on Reddit and openly let hostile nations deeply manipulation. Worst of all, any invocation of Neil Postman on Reddit gets ignored. Not front-page explaining the problems of Fox News (this Reddit posting I am commenting about references Fox News). Why isn't Reddit making "the little guy" Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News a non-stop topic every 3 days since 2015 / March 2016 when it was wide release? Because amusement-washing at the Reddit humor mill of non-name accounts / hidden identity open to Kremlin is too busy joking and laughing at Donald Trump's performances of antics politics / Tony Clifton techniques along with Surkov students of the Kremlin!

The hate of humanism with the promotion of Trump hate / Trump mockery / Trump dehumanization FOR OVER TEN YEARS, day after day, constantly in media.

Reddit society and the screen captured messages (which are not Reddit) both suffer from mind-fuck by Russia to ignore Russia. The evidence of mutliple NATO nations, which did not elect a black skin color President, having a media invasion since Russia. The behavior of measles and RFK Jr and the behavior of COVID-19 has nothing to do with black skin color. Yet, Russian information warfare and China DOES have something to do with measles and COVID-19. Reddit society is so happy and thrilled dunking on and hating upon MAGA that people can not grasp information warfare at all anymore. Emotional shit-flinging way worse than skin color. White on white education competititon. All the sports-competititioon around university (Steely Dan Deacon Blues) and all the degree prestige competittion around education has made insulting and mockng rural people forignorance... and Reddit shows the worst kind of ignornace on the subject. People on Reddit are costantly reeferncing that a billionare, which Reddit cites as a source of problem, runs FOx News, and that inforamtion warfare from Fox News has harmed rural less-educated people. And what about domestic Russia? Did Putin get voted out and repalced with a blak skin color leader and is that why rural Russian people support invading ahd harming Ukraine? Because black skin color? My god, people can't study domestic Russian television and Surkov techniques of media systems in Russia - and compare how they are similar to Fox News. And learning from 9/11, even when it is the same race /even when it is the same skin color / Muslim on Muslim violence is about media systems of Quran fiction media. Malala getting shot on her school bus and her schools being blown up (which is more than just one girl shooting which you might attribure to bad luck) because of Radio Mullah she documents - did you think at age 14 she knew of Rush Limbaugh radio? Media, media,media, education, media. Billionares and elders (Muallah) in media. Putin is a billionare!

Front-page Reddit message also from other media platforms. *Deep down they know to blame*. No, I see zero demonstration that people know to blame Putins mutlile-nation media nnvasion since March 2013. People are not blaming egomania / egoism by name. People are not blaming Russian Internet Research Agency by name. People can't name Surkov techniques and methods (Surkov students). People isntead just pick the most superficial and shallow answer "deep down", the OPPOSITE of deep unerstanding, but blaming Americans for everything going to shit. NOTHING IN UNTIED STATES OF AMERICA could be more OBVIOUS than a New York City Penthouse (Top flor of Trump Tower) PLAYBOY is a CITY SLICKER with a NEW YORK CITY FOX NEWS RUPERT MURDOCH. NOTHING COULD EVER BE MORE BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS. What changed is the Internet Research Agency and the blinding light of the Apple iPhone / Apple iPad devices into rural minds of people who never studied New York City / Manhattan teaching from Professor Neil Postman at New York Univerity. It is the absence of MEDIA ECOLOGY that people don't understand Bible Verse "1 John 3:17", even the clergy can't teach Matthew 6:5 as they see Trump pose with The Bible in front of a Church for photo opportuntiy. We have a runaway Russian media simualcra launched in Q2 2013! I am a published author in message systems, I worked for Bill Gates and Paul Allen doing their private personal messaging systems! I am not some casual! I traveled to North Africa (Algeria) for the Arab Spring at the start of December 2010 to study media ecology before the Arab Spring became world famous hot/origin in Tunisia. I moved over to Amman Jordan in March 2011 to study the Syria wa outbreak for years / media ecology online vs. HDTV news vs. people conversations / behaiors / attitudes.

For sake of clarity: "owned" means "adicted to Tony Clifton mocking", being audience members who mock and insult Tony Clifton acts - often calling Clifton performnres as {terrible dumb idiots stupid}, Eating the Surkovian onions without any self-awareness that the most sophsticated military infomation warfare is expliting their mind.

And people with free time and spare time to comment on social media can't create a movement to nicely educate the society on law and reform laws. Instead, social media people have used spare time since March 2013 to suck down Russian information warfare and adopt Donald Trump style use of social media: mocking, insulting, low-effort low-thinking trash-talk communications on computers capable of much more. Democracy has turned into Russian Ukraine hate just as the IRA intended... an entertainment at dehumanizing the rural low-education Americans who could have been saved if social media would stop insulting and mockign (Like Trump and Musk) and help out low-educated lawyers and low-comprehension low-understanding voters appreciate WHY America was great - and not just worshp Putin billionare ringleader working with Trump billionare ringleader. Billionares and wealth concentration alone are not waht made USA great and progressive. Yet,the welath lords provide the entertainment sports games and entertainment video games and entertaiment big budget TV shows (Star Wars Andor) that big wealth avertires and sponrs.... and social media society eats it up. Competitive hate and insutling on Reddit that the IRA keept feeding 2013 onward became entertainment to pieople.

WHen evey Reddit comemnt is entertainment / mocking / mockey / amusement / comedy just like Donald Trump is comedy / Putin Surkov echniqeus are comedy. Stewart does not grasp that USA lost a meme war and Putin won to induce self-harm by praise of humor and absurd. The jokes will wash away the killings. People are willing to due for dumb jokes, Reddit aleady proved that against the Internet Research Agency. Stewert even joked his own children didn't enjoy authentic learning in school like Malala, and nor does Reddit society.
