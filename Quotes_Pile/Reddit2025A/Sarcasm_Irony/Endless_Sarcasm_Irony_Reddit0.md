Mocking away at the enemy. The other political party. Not asserting truth and goodness, just insulting the egoism in Reddit "better than her" egoism. A pecking order of egoism vs. egoism of media consumers about the sex acts of billionares on private jets and private islands. Not the Reddit frame (Medium is the MassAge) of "MURDERED BY WORDS!", we killed Nacy Mace, murder Nacy Mace, come watch the murder!

Contradictory Vaudeville uncited by Reddit audience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9_L9GRRsQo .

Self-own! Murdered by words! Endless mockery of the seriousness of people being attracted to this surreal entertainment factor of RFK Jr / Surkov Russian governing technique / Kremlin information warfare of absurd surreal communications and contradiction.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1n9wwzt/how_to_selfown/

Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of NeiL Postamn's 1985 book "Amsuing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We aare drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech ddescribes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

Clowin images, Trump playing Tony Clifton clown acts. And a social media society that entirely will not become serious about QAnon / IRA / Cambridge Analytica and how the rich have weaponized absurd surreal amusement mind exploits.     
https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1na2e7s/trumps_ever_changing_story/

More eatign the Surkov onions. No matter how extremely absurd and surreal, nobody can call out Surkov techniques by name. Despite BBC coverage.   
https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1na04ds/who_actually_believes_this/

Front page of Reddit. The blind deep faith... that *turning into the wipeout* will save the USA. For over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, endless faith that more satire and more absurd will address the Surkov public relations techniques, Russian information warfare. That *reality and nonfiction* can be re-asserted with more creative fiction bullshit.

Humor-washing, LOL-washing, amusement-washing the situation. Constantly promoting that Donald Trump White House / FBI / federal in 2025 is entertainming and thrilling content just like popular baseball sports topics.

Fiction TV "Columbo" content in White House image with Trump. And describing paradox. But completely unable to articulate that paradox / surreal / absurd is Russian information warfare. Ameicans eat this paradox mind-fucking shit up.

A fake picture of Donald Trump, entertainment fixation of America, on front page of Reddit.   
Trump doesn't produce enough fiction entertainment for USA media addicts, so people create their own fan ficiton of Donald Trump. Media addiction runs USA society, and Trump is the addiction We The People have.

&nbsp;

Front page of Reddit: "Donald Trump has no moral compass" - you have to be BLIND to not see that Trump is attracted to fiction. Trump's moral compass points to: **fiction, badness itself**. If We The People think Trump just blindly finds service to Putin... We The People completely do not grasp Surkov techniques of Kremlin year 2011. Donald Trump is not directinless / meandering. He is doing agressive marching in pro-Russia direction since March 2013!

Media addicts of America cheer on every Donald Trump media content topic. We The People entirely unable to resist the antics politics, symbolism, status symbol, POTUS icon.

Front page of Reddit, 3 words **"more of this"** (Bluesky embed) message - and what *this* is? Pizzagate / QAnon / Epstein private jet / rich white men in private jet sex acts media stimulation. **Social media, Reddit, is not calling for removal of Donald Trump from office - an end to fiction-driven antics politics*** - social media is calling for more Epstein sex content of the lifestyles of the rich and famous entertainment. Not calling for more women to speak up against absuers on social media, but alling for more about the [magical list that was TEASED by Donald Trump Jr. before the 2024 elections.

Entertaiment-washing of murder and killing. As if people who cheer on gun killings don't get their own. As people who promote mock thy enemy don't get mocked. As if people who don't promote *hate thy enemy* don't get hated. Russia won an informaiton war since March 2013 to make Americans hate Americans and nobody is resisting (teaching about, educating, able to describe in any meaningful detail that demonstrates comprehension) Putin's informaiotn warfare. People are eating up Russia's hate. As long as there are humans to keep hating, out-group hate patterns are cheered on.         https://old.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/1ndprw8/mrw_a_racist_bigot_get_a_taste_of_his_own_medicine/

This month, at the start, Reddit and Bluesky was full of death-wishing Donald Trump. It was a constant topic for the entire 3 day holiday weekend. Whatever "the left" means to people. Russia won, Surkov won since year 2013.

Reddit community is having a front-page drinking celebration of public murder of a media content creator they don't like. Reddit vs. Talking Point media. Fiction vs. fiction addicts. Russia IRA mind-fucked everyone since March 2013 with 5,000 patterns of out-group hate.

Fixation on Donald Trump. ignoring Reddit, ignoring Facebook, ignoring Twitter (Elon Musk), ignoring Truth Social content, ignoring the Russian Internet Reserach Agency since year 2013. Putin is leading the entire USA into blaming the USA for a war Russia won, a media invasion that USA people can't even explain or describe. Nobody can read nonfiction books by Neil Postman or Peter Pomerantsev and expalin what is gong on, just fixate on the **status symbol Donald Trump** who is the nonstop center of all media (reddit inclusive) attention.
