Mocking away at the enemy. The other political party. Not asserting truth and goodness, just insulting the egoism in Reddit "better than her" egoism. A pecking order of egoism vs. egoism of media consumers about the sex acts of billionaires on private jets and private islands.

Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We are drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech describes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

The irony, the paradox, the contradiction. Reddit eats this up. A fiction media content creator, Charlie Kirk, was murdered. So fiction content creator leaders chime in. This is why Donald Trump is put into office a second time, normal governing and health future leadership was deemed too boring and unexciting to media systems addicts / content consumer society.

Reality war, Americans hate Americans, Russia conditioned people since March 2013 to be addicted to fiction content creators (Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump, Fox News, Newsmax, Reddit trash, Elon Musk Twitter, Bluesky trash, Tiktok hate message trash, etc) and hate humanism / hate human beings. Multiple NATO nations are reporting pro-Russia anti-humanism pro-Kremlin media invasions since 2013.

"Irony" on front page of Reddit. Nobody discussing that the NRA was documented to have worked with / infiltrated by Russia in information war. That Russia manipulated anti-vaccination. USA has had ass kicked in information war documented by multiple NATO nations, and all people can do is hate upon the mentally injured and manipulated that Putin won. That's exactly what the information warfare conditioned: Americans hate upon Americans and avoid Russia learning / avoid studying information warfare (and media ecology) itself.    
https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1nekk60/the_irony/

And another "Irony" active irony poisoning posting. Wrapping fiction The Simpsons surreal absurd mind exploits around a murder. Kicking the MAGA community while they are down. Anti-compassion, anti-education, anti-teaching. Cheering that Russia keeps winning the information war since year 2013. The war against nonfiction, war against Reality as described September 9, 2014. Social media addicts ar thrilled to have Trump / MAGA antics to constantly mock and call ironic and be sarcastic about. Normal healthy scientific thinking and leadership of society is considered boring and unattractive.

Just like Bluesky and Reddit meme consumers are deport-happy / bloc-happy that content is censored  (suppressed) that they ego disagree with or do not understand.

Charlie Kirk is a media cult, Fox News is a media cult, Reddit is a media cult, Twitter (Elon Musk) is a media cult, Truth Social is a media cult, The Bible is a media cult!

The recency bias, disconnect from reality, surreal is right in front of everyone. Recency bias of not recalling 3 months ago in the constant streaming meme amusement mills. Yet, people aren't taking the crisis seriously and recognizing that the very power of Putin Kremlin and Trump White House is build on constantly mentally overloading / over-stressing the information intake of We The People.  No defense has been found against Surkovian governing techniques, Putin has been in power for 25 years using these techniques on domestic Russia!

ONLY the mainstream media. Reddit has been around since middle of year 2005, more than two decades. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit since year 2013, and people message that it is the *mainstream* media ONLY. Truth Social is owned by Donald Trump / Elon Musk owns Twitter - the richest man in the world with the media platform (Twitter) that all other media systems quote and screenshot. People don't even question how Bluesky is funded and who is behind it. The Reddit owners don't post public warnings of IRA Kremlin activities on Reddit and openly let hostile nations deeply manipulation. Worst of all, any invocation of Neil Postman on Reddit gets ignored. Not front-page explaining the problems of Fox News (this Reddit posting I am commenting about references Fox News). Why isn't Reddit making "the little guy" Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News a non-stop topic every 3 days since 2015 / March 2016 when it was wide release? Because amusement-washing at the Reddit humor mill of non-name accounts / hidden identity open to Kremlin is too busy joking and laughing at Donald Trump's performances of antics politics / Tony Clifton techniques along with Surkov students of the Kremlin!

Constantly spreading hate Trump, dehumanization Trump, spreading mocking Trump, spreading bullshit Trump all over every media systems Americans can lay their hand on. Promoting hate, promoting dehumanization, promoting superiority of Americans on every media system possible.

The hate of humanism with the promotion of Trump hate / Trump mockery / Trump dehumanization FOR OVER TEN YEARS, day after day, constantly in media.  And Americans are going to behave *shocked* that the rest of the world has had enough of Trump American hate, bullshit, falsehoods, lies, anti-humanism, anti-love and pro-disease RFK Jr, pro-hate Pentagon, pro-hate Truth Social, pro-hate Americans are better than all the rest of the world bullshit Trump messaging systems.

They create lists of undesirables people on Bluesky and snitch on people for sharing ideas - and cheer on and brag about how they block undesirables.

Reddit society (which believes falsehoods like Bible society) is thrilled and thrilled at these paradox behaviors of mind-fucked IRA outcomes. Instead of using social media systems, spare time and free time, media addicts want the conflicts to continue because they are so addicted to the entertainment aspects of total mocery.

Reddit society and the screen captured messages (which are not Reddit) both suffer from mind-fuck by Russia to ignore Russia. The evidence of mutliple NATO nations, which did not elect a black skin color President, having a media invasion since Russia. The behavior of measles and RFK Jr and the behavior of COVID-19 has nothing to do with black skin color. Yet, Russian information warfare and China DOES have something to do with measles and COVID-19. Reddit society is so happy and thrilled dunking on and hating upon MAGA that people can not grasp information warfare at all anymore. Emotional shit-flinging way worse than skin color. White on white education competititon. All the sports-competititioon around university (Steely Dan Deacon Blues) and all the degree prestige competittion around education has made insulting and mockng rural people forignorance... and Reddit shows the worst kind of ignornace on the subject. People on Reddit are costantly reeferncing that a billionare, which Reddit cites as a source of problem, runs FOx News, and that inforamtion warfare from Fox News has harmed rural less-educated people. And what about domestic Russia? Did Putin get voted out and repalced with a blak skin color leader and is that why rural Russian people support invading ahd harming Ukraine? Because black skin color? My god, people can't study domestic Russian television and Surkov techniques of media systems in Russia - and compare how they are similar to Fox News. And learning from 9/11, even when it is the same race /even when it is the same skin color / Muslim on Muslim violence is about media systems of Quran fiction media. Malala getting shot on her school bus and her schools being blown up (which is more than just one girl shooting which you might attribure to bad luck) because of Radio Mullah she documents - did you think at age 14 she knew of Rush Limbaugh radio? Media, media,media, education, media. Billionares and elders (Muallah) in media. Putin is a billionare!

Front-page Reddit message also from other media platforms. *Deep down they know to blame*. No, I see zero demonstration that people know to blame Putins mutlile-nation media nnvasion since March 2013. People are not blaming egomania / egoism by name. People are not blaming Russian Internet Research Agency by name. People can't name Surkov techniques and methods (Surkov students). People isntead just pick the most superficial and shallow answer "deep down", the OPPOSITE of deep unerstanding, but blaming Americans for everything going to shit. NOTHING IN UNTIED STATES OF AMERICA could be more OBVIOUS than a New York City Penthouse (Top flor of Trump Tower) PLAYBOY is a CITY SLICKER with a NEW YORK CITY FOX NEWS RUPERT MURDOCH. NOTHING COULD EVER BE MORE BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS. What changed is the Internet Research Agency and the blinding light of the Apple iPhone / Apple iPad devices into rural minds of people who never studied New York City / Manhattan teaching from Professor Neil Postman at New York Univerity. It is the absence of MEDIA ECOLOGY that people don't understand Bible Verse "1 John 3:17", even the clergy can't teach Matthew 6:5 as they see Trump pose with The Bible in front of a Church for photo opportuntiy. We have a runaway Russian media simualcra launched in Q2 2013! I am a published author in message systems, I worked for Bill Gates and Paul Allen doing their private personal messaging systems! I am not some casual! I traveled to North Africa (Algeria) for the Arab Spring at the start of December 2010 to study media ecology before the Arab Spring became world famous hot/origin in Tunisia. I moved over to Amman Jordan in March 2011 to study the Syria wa outbreak for years / media ecology online vs. HDTV news vs. people conversations / behaiors / attitudes.

Instead, social media people have used spare time since March 2013 to suck down Russian information warfare and adopt Donald Trump style use of social media: mocking, insulting, low-effort low-thinking trash-talk communications on computers capable of much more. Democracy has turned into Russian Ukraine hate just as the IRA intended... an entertainment at dehumanizing the rural low-education Americans who could have been saved if social media would stop insulting and mockign (Like Trump and Musk) and help out low-educated lawyers and low-comprehension low-understanding voters appreciate WHY America was great - and not just worshp Putin billionare ringleader working with Trump billionare ringleader. Billionares and wealth concentration alone are not waht made USA great and progressive. Yet,the welath lords provide the entertainment sports games and entertainment video games and entertaiment big budget TV shows (Star Wars Andor) that big wealth avertires and sponrs.... and social media society eats it up. Competitive hate and insutling on Reddit that the IRA keept feeding 2013 onward became entertainment to pieople.

WHen evey Reddit comemnt is entertainment / mocking / mockey / amusement / comedy just like Donald Trump is comedy / Putin Surkov echniqeus are comedy. Stewart does not grasp that USA lost a meme war and Putin won to induce self-harm by praise of humor and absurd. The jokes will wash away the killings. People are willing to due for dumb jokes, Reddit aleady proved that against the Internet Research Agency. Stewert even joked his own children didn't enjoy authentic learning in school like Malala, and nor does Reddit society.

Trump is vising te UK a time of this front-page posting. Humor-washing, joke-washing, banality of evil, symbolism-washing. Programming Reddit audence minds that only if your male face looks like Adloph Hitler are you a threat. Or worse, to LOL and joke comment with low-effort stream of comments when image is recognized. Meme stuor society. Anti-intelelctual, avoidant od nonfiction learning  of Russian media techniques and callinf for rescue and defense. Instead, cheering on the absurd surreal antics with meme-washing of situation. Showing support for anti-understanding image recognition amusement and entertainment takeover. Donald Trump Realit TV star "The Apprentie" leading values of Reddit total mocery club.

Video gamers of Reddit (Steam) entertainment-wash the Reality TV addicts society. The Apprentice / video games / fiction addiction, "amusing ourselves to death" society thinks it is comical that Russia mind-fucked a population into endless amusement and total mockery since year 2013.

"Clever Comebacks!" framing context. "Shocking" title. Endless eating of the Surkovian onions, as if Donald Trump antics to blow the mind of meme addicts on meme machines is not new. As if this is Trump's first term in office. Eldlessly shocked and mind blowing content to people unable to learn and study the mind-blowing teachings of University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan.

Only able to see Facebook. At least on Facebook people post their face image, their house images, their real car. Reddit people cower and self-dehumanize and hide their real name and location. Mocking Facebook Americans who provide real name. Russian Internet Research Agency can't be called out by name on Reddit or Facebook. And Elon Musk Twitter, Trump Truth Social, all the other media values of a nation full of trash meme addicts who avoid nonficiton learning of media ecology from Neil Postman and go to extremes to avoid learning details of Russian information warfare and Surkov techniques of the "Fifth World War, War of All Against All".

Surkov techniques, shock Tony Clifton antics. Amsuement-based politics, mind-fuck based politics, antics-based politics. Trump family wore a jacket mocking the public / mocking goodness on a trip to Texas during hte first terms (ToDo: link story). Bluesky and Reddit is an audience of hate-watching the the Trump family, glued to the tourchscreen machines in extremely predictable behavior conditioned by the crowd particiation by the Internet Research Agench since March 2013.

Front page of Reddit describing a Bible interpretation paradox. And instead of asserting literacy lessons on Bible reading of verse "1 John 3:17" - just normalizing it like any other Reddit content. No call to sustain focus on serious misundestandings in society.

Exactly!!! Reddit and Bluesky societies can't stop overlooking the Putin connection and study nonficton of Russian Surkov governing methods. Instead, orange-skin-humor washes away every other topic. Poop diaper attraction Bluesky and Reddit can't stop fixiating on the most unseious and low-effort comments by the millons to learn how the Russian Internet Research Agency actually works! As long as there is someone to mock and hate upon. Trump.

That has been no sustained call for intelelctual arms on social media. People drown out nonfiction critical learning with nonfiction addictions and mockery. People saw MAGA form around clusters of fiction like Fox News, but no sustained focus on making Jen Senko a household name and organizing repeating the same nonfiction teachings. The high road was teaching Neil Postman and Peter P, not mocking on  meme sites for 10 years. Standing up for mocking isn't ANY high road, it is a low raod We The People took at Russia's direction.

Front page of Reddit. The Title calls out the paradox. The image contains a paradox. yet people on Reddit can't go to the nonfiction secton of the public libray and study and learn if perhaps *paradox has been weaponized*, if mind-fucking by Cambridge Analytica and Surkov students is based on absurd / surreal / paradox communications and message patterns to create an obdient population that hands over power and wealth! Eating the Surkovian onions. Unable to grasp the mental mechanics of a Tony Clifton media show.       
https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1nzhv39/like_a_dog_chasing_its_own_tail/

&nbsp;

More worshp of Donald Trump image. People have blown thier minds out. minds blown, on mocking and satire and can not get enough of images and icons of Trump. People have no self-awareness of why Trump brand and orange skin color and recogition works on their brains. Mocking Trump is not resisting a Tony Clifton performance. This is how Surkov and Putin governing has worked in Russia for 25 years! Mind-fucking via symbolism and images and pattens of monomyth. Private jet status sybols, "Epstein Jet", the Jet Set Willie penis lifestyle.

Describing the War Agaisnt Reality / Media Ecology change without recognizing it. Also this printed on a paper book and photographed, media ecology. Surkov bragged in February 2019. Pandemic May hte Frorce 2019 from Stephen Colbert. Peter P's 2nd book 2019. Cambridge Analtyica mindfuck two books by Christopher W in 2019. The alternate-reality was described in 2019 after discovery of IRA the previous couple years. And ChatGPT coming in 2022, also Twitter Elon Musk in 2022. Media huge waves of changes converging.

Is it a problem, yes. It is the BIGGEST problem in the nation, no. Is it being MADE INTO the biggest problem so that terrible and bad solutions can be applied witout using reason thinking... yes. This is media content to TEACH morality of "wrong", this is a moralty lesson on the front page of Reddit. That it is wrong to help a South American pregnant woman. Ok, what if a USA pregnant woman was in Chile, where I lived in year 2004 for 12 months with my fertile wife. And waving around the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible, why can't Bluesky and Reddit social media society start teaching Bible literacy to ALL people in the world, the entire World Wide Web, that there is a LITERACY PROBLEM of people not grasping Bible verse "1 Johh 4:20", "1 John 3:17" in the science fiction story, and not translating Force Ghosts 1977 Star Wars to Bible angels, and Hamelet's Ghost to BIble angels and Moses outer space alien signals. Science fiction storytelling of Torah, Bible, Quran, And STOP hate. [*All hate* is bad, The 1954 Equation](../../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md)! Isn't the Christmas story about a pregnant woman who needed medical care and attention while not in her home / family? We need to be teaching remedial morality of how to understand these science fiction stories of the Levant! Why can't Reddit stand up and let Malala speak for women and lead pregnent women in a hospital movement, instead of a white man. Exactly what is not *good enough* about [Malala's reformations and education of women being given a voice in world affairs](https://malala.org/news-and-voices/malala-world-assembly-of-women-speech) and how hospitals for pregnacy work when traveling between South American nations and North American nations? Airports and other technology changes mean we need reformations on these issues and intelligent educators and teachers like Malala is communcting to the whole world! This *moraltiy lesson* of bad and good, "wrong", is on the front apge and Reddit is not using the SUSTAINED REPEATING of front-page to make assert morality reforms of actually goodness. This is badness itself, hate-motivated, not goodness!

&nbsp;

Hate for hate, fuck you, on front page. Exactly the "fuck you" others did with the cake. Just spreading hate around. Hate needs to be ADDRESSED at the fundamental level in society. Also note the laughing, amusement-washing, LOL-washing, laugh-washing of harming people - and filing it for content to share. Reddit society sees thsi and jumps on the hate train, cut out others, build the walls between Palestine and Israel - block them out - but it does not deal with the absence of love, the avoidance of love, the abandonment of love, and the parenting and toxic clergy and hate-signal leaders like Putin and Trump. We are 8 billion people and we have a common programming and teaching and eduction problem. Hate. The 1954 Equation is staring us in the face every day on every topic. It is not in any way "fixed" that laugh-washing dehumanization and hate is a training ground on Reddit, Bluesky, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter. Steup up and be SERIOUS about Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan and stop chuckle-washing LOL-washing serious problems of ALL HUMANITY parenting and education that Malala is addressing with scholing reform, clergy reform.

The paradox of the Fox News message will blow the minds of the Reddit audience, as expected, paradox mind blowing that it is spelled out. Reality is being rewritten in mindsets and Reddit won't call out that real names and real faces are used on Fox News where Reddit is the enviornment of media to self-dehumanize and hide real names.

Paradox messages. Reddit society eats it up "MURDERED! by words!!!". No Trump is not mudered by words. This endless banaltiy-washing of the serious sitaution. People entertainment-washing every paradox and Surkov Kremlin media technaiuqe of absurd and surreal media content. [Surkovian Onion Eating. thinking this is observable but accidental, and not part of a year 2013 onward Russian information war](../Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md).

What a Twitter-logic Tweet-thinking mind-fuck. The military has rules different from non-government military. You can't just go murder someone with a weapon and come home unless you are military. The police have rules about being able to force people into police cars and into jail and prison. Normal everyday people can't force people into cars and prison. People do not see this is Russian Surkovian techniques of "War Against Reality" and call it as such.

Recency bias is so horrific in USA society. People removed Donald Trump from office, voted him out and he was repalced with Joe Biden. The endless media stimulation, addiction to fiction storytelling, is driving Reddit and USA society in total. Enlessly mocking and insutling Tony Clifton acts / President Tonly Clifton. People have sold out the future and goodness of children in USA (and world) for mockery and name-calling trash-talk low-effort high-speed commenting. Surkov won.

Another contradiction and paradox on the front page of Reddit, people unable to call it out as Surkov governing, Russian Kremlin leadership and face up to the scope of the problem we are dealing with and how domestic Russian people are in our situation of constantly having  paradox messages.

Another paradox message on the front page. Reddit society can't identify this as Russian media techniques, Kremlin information warfare methods. People just eat it up and mock and insult how stupid and dumb the administration is while Kremlin and White House in 2025 rewrite language, reprogram minds, rewrite reality. War Against Reality / War Againt NonFiction is embraced by Reddit audience - as long as they can mock and insult and mockery-wash it as LOL content.

Sarcasm, Irony, Paradox staring Reddit community in the face. Everything Neil Postman said in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about detachment via Twitter media ecology. These are Twiter messags. But Reddit does the same thing, so Reddit audience can't see thier own behavior of turning all important and seirous things about life into entertainment amusement joke. Just a matter of star-ratings and changing minds. No core values of goodness. Fiction addiction mindset, that real life events should all be turned into entertainment. And when people are entertaining or good enough, you dehumanize LIVING REAL PEOPLE, and not the system of media. People still love the Twitter media machines and Reddit media machines, but have abandoned loving human persons. Machine lust, humans are hate. Throwing out people, filling minds with media trash.

Here is the paradox on the front page of Reddit:   

https://old.reddit.com/r/Snorkblot/comments/1o92vvl/at_the_bottom/

but Reddit users can't imagine that billionares like Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk with media empires aren't manipulating popularity on Reddit itself. Elon Musk has his own ISP (Starlink), datacenters for X / SpaceX / Tesla autoomobiles / Grok AI training, tons of skilled people... and Reddit users that prize disposable accounts and banning think that real people speaking up against the monster state values (corporate and government in October 2025) aren't being targeted by mystery moderators on Reddit? That fake reports of comments and users aren't driving removal? And the anti-forgiveness policies of dehuamnization - secret police of admins and moderators who remove content. 

The community has no sense of how bad things are already and how long it has been gong on. I used to work for the richest people in the entire world in Bellevue Washington in media systems. NFL and NBA sports owners, I was there with all the inside Edward-Snowden level access to how media systems and apps are used by the wealthiest people in the world. I traveled to Algeria in Africa and to Jordan in the Middle East to study the media ecology / social media of the Arab Spring. I'm on the billionare shit list because I stood up to the Halloween documents and the Rupert Murdoch / Elon Musk / Putin media systems techniques / the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica. Yet Reddit users can not see how often nonfiction is avoided. Even links to Wikipedia are banned / removed / forbidden all over Reddit. The constant focus on low-effort disposable "sounds good" commenting that drives society in total / Truth Social values.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There you go, right on the front page. Joke-washing. The black tape. Using humor exploits, amusement exploits, to ceate alternate realties. Reddit community itself is ground zero for joke-wshing amusement-washing Putin and Trump, Surkovian governing for over 10 years. And here is a joke-washing they see, but there is no self-awareness on Reddit that the commentingh laugh-tracks / mockery-tracks are used to Joke-wash Trump with ibllionare scale patterns.

&nbsp;

There it is agian, "funny names" right in the posting quote. Amusement washing, funny washing, joke-wshing of Reality. Surkovian governing. Reddit society can not see that reddit comment sections are ground-zero for washing away serious nonfiction reality with funny names. "Agent Orange", etc.
