Endless "Celebration of Ignorance", "Celebration of Fiction content" on social machines USA.

Front page of Reddit, making Trump into a supernatural mythological being. Power beyond human.

Playing dumb on Reddit, playing ignorant: "What kind of logic is this?"

Tracking EVERY MINUTE of Tony Clifton apperance, all ready for the mockery and insult about how terrible Donald Trump (Tony Clifton) is at his job. Sarcasm and irony poisoning to say "Weekend At Bernies" fiction reference, everything is fiction addiction.

The hyper reality this past week has been mass mind crazy.

Mocking away at the enemy. The other political party. Not asserting truth and goodness, just insulting the egoism in Reddit "better than her" egoism. A pecking order of egoism vs. egoism of media consumers about the sex acts of billionares on private jets and private islands. Not the Reddit frame (Medium is the MassAge) of "MURDERED BY WORDS!", we killed Nacy Mace, murder Nacy Mace, come watch the murder!

"We Live In the Absurd" on Reddit Entirely unale to state that absurd surreal is Russian information warfare.

Contradictory Vaudeville uncited by Reddit audience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9_L9GRRsQo . Surreal / Absurd mental inversions are identified but no concern to defend against them and describe the historical outcomes of this portion of the human brain being systematically exploited by Russia and clergy. https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/

Self-own! Murdered by words! Endless mockery of the seriousness of people being attracted to this surreal entertainment factor of RFK Jr / Surkov Russian governing technique / Kremlin information warfare of absurd surreal communications and contradiction.  

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1n9wwzt/how_to_selfown/

Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of NeiL Postamn's 1985 book "Amsuing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We aare drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech ddescribes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

Clowin images, Trump playing Tony Clifton clown acts. And a social media society that entirely will not become serious about QAnon / IRA / Cambridge Analytica and how the rich have weaponized absurd surreal amusement mind exploits.     
https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1na2e7s/trumps_ever_changing_story/

More eatign the Surkov onions. No matter how extremely absurd and surreal, nobody can call out Surkov techniques by name. Despite BBC coverage.   
https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1na04ds/who_actually_believes_this/

Front page of Reddit. The blind deep faith... that *turning into the wipeout* will save the USA. For over TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS, endless faith that more satire and more absurd will address the Surkov public relations techniques, Russian information warfare. That *reality and nonfiction* can be re-asserted with more creative fiction bullshit.

Humor-washing, LOL-washing, amusement-washing the situation. Constantly promoting that Donald Trump White House / FBI / federal in 2025 is entertainming and thrilling content just like popular baseball sports topics.     
https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1na3wqw/mike_johnson_just_announced_that_this_woman_stole/

&nbsp;

Fiction TV "Columbo" content in White House image with Trump. And describing paradox. But completely unable to articulate that paradox / surreal / absurd is Russian information warfare. Ameicans eat this paradox mind-fucking shit up.        
https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1nauhrk/just_one_more_thing/

Entertainment-washing what is going on via Reddit memes    
Yes, compaed to Clergy / King, 1776 USA was liberal. New World Order. Not God Dictatorship.

A fake picture of Donald Trump, entertainment fixation of America, on front page of Reddit.   
Trump doesn't produce enough fiction entertainment for USA media addicts, so people create their own fan ficiton of Donald Trump. Media addiction runs USA society, and Trump is the addiction We The People have.
