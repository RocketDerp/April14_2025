Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We are drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech describes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

The irony, the paradox, the contradiction. Reddit eats this up. A fiction media content creator, Charlie Kirk, was murdered. So fiction content creator leaders chime in.

"Irony" on front page of Reddit. Nobody discussing that the NRA was documented to have worked with / infiltrated by Russia in information war. That Russia manipulated anti-vaccination. USA has had ass kicked in information war documented by multiple NATO nations, and all people can do is hate upon the mentally injured and manipulated that Putin won. That's exactly what the information warfare conditioned: Americans hate upon Americans and avoid Russia learning / avoid studying information warfare (and media ecology) itself.    
https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1nekk60/the_irony/

And another "Irony" active irony poisoning posting. Wrapping fiction The Simpsons surreal absurd mind exploits around a murder. Kicking the MAGA community while they are down. Anti-compassion, anti-education, anti-teaching. Cheering that Russia keeps winning the information war since year 2013. The war against nonfiction, war against Reality as described September 9, 2014. Social media addicts ar thrilled to have Trump / MAGA antics to constantly mock and call ironic and be sarcastic about. Normal healthy scientific thinking and leadership of society is considered boring and unattractive.

Charlie Kirk is a media cult, Fox News is a media cult, Reddit is a media cult, Twitter (Elon Musk) is a media cult, Truth Social is a media cult, The Bible is a media cult!

Yet, people aren't taking the crisis seriously and recognizing that the very power of Putin Kremlin and Trump White House is build on constantly mentally overloading / over-stressing the information intake of We The People.  No defense has been found against Surkovian governing techniques, Putin has been in power for 25 years using these techniques on domestic Russia!

ONLY the mainstream media. Reddit has been around since middle of year 2005, more than two decades. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit since year 2013, and people message that it is the *mainstream* media ONLY. Truth Social is owned by Donald Trump / Elon Musk owns Twitter - the richest man in the world with the media platform (Twitter) that all other media systems quote and screenshot. People don't even question how Bluesky is funded and who is behind it. The Reddit owners don't post public warnings of IRA Kremlin activities on Reddit and openly let hostile nations deeply manipulation. Worst of all, any invocation of Neil Postman on Reddit gets ignored. Not front-page explaining the problems of Fox News (this Reddit posting I am commenting about references Fox News). Why isn't Reddit making "the little guy" Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News a non-stop topic every 3 days since 2015 / March 2016 when it was wide release? Because amusement-washing at the Reddit humor mill of non-name accounts / hidden identity open to Kremlin is too busy joking and laughing at Donald Trump's performances of antics politics / Tony Clifton techniques along with Surkov students of the Kremlin!

The hate of humanism with the promotion of Trump hate / Trump mockery / Trump dehumanization FOR OVER TEN YEARS, day after day, constantly in media.  And Americans are going to behave *shocked* that the rest of the world has had enough of Trump American hate, bullshit, falsehoods, lies, anti-humanism, anti-love and pro-disease RFK Jr, pro-hate Pentagon, pro-hate Truth Social, pro-hate Americans are better than all the rest of the world bullshit Trump messaging systems.
