Mocking away at the enemy. The other political party. Not asserting truth and goodness, just insulting the egoism in Reddit "better than her" egoism. A pecking order of egoism vs. egoism of media consumers about the sex acts of billionares on private jets and private islands. Not the Reddit frame (Medium is the MassAge) of "MURDERED BY WORDS!", we killed Nacy Mace, murder Nacy Mace, come watch the murder!

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1n9wwzt/how_to_selfown/

Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of NeiL Postamn's 1985 book "Amsuing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We aare drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech ddescribes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

Front page of Reddit. The blind deep faith... that *turning into the wipeout* will save the USA.

Front page of Reddit: "Donald Trump has no moral compass" - you have to be BLIND to not see that Trump is attracted to fiction. Trump's moral compass points to: **fiction, badness itself**. If We The People think Trump just blindly finds service to Putin... We The People completely do not grasp Surkov techniques of Kremlin year 2011. Donald Trump is not directinless / meandering. He is doing agressive marching in pro-Russia direction since March 2013!

As if people who don't promote *hate thy enemy* don't get hated. Russia won an informaiton war since March 2013 to make Americans hate Americans and nobody is resisting (teaching about, educating, able to describe in any meaningful detail that demonstrates comprehension) Putin's informaiotn warfare.

The irony, the paradox, the contradiction. Reddit eats this up. A fiction media content creator, Charlie Kirk, was murdered. So fiction content creator leaders chime in. This is why Donald Trump is put into office a second time, normal governing and health future leadership was deemed too boring and unexciting to media systems addicts / content consumer society.

Reality war, Americans hate Americans, Russia conditioned people since March 2013 to be addicted to fiction content creators (Charlike Kirk, Donald Trump, Fox News, Newsmax, Reddit trash, Elon Musk Twitter, Bluesky trash, Tiktok hate message trash, etc) and hate humanism / hate human beings. Mutliple NATO nations are reporting pro-Russia anti-humanism pro-Kremoin media invasions since 2013.

&nbsp;

"Irony" on front page of Reddit. Nobody discussing that the NRA was documented to have worked with / infiltrated by Russia in information war. That Russia manipulated anti-vaccination. USA has had ass kicked in information war documented by multiple NATO nations, and all people can do is hate upon the mentally injured and manipulated that Putin won. That's exactly what the informaiton warfare conditiones: Americans hate upon Americans and avoid Russsia learning / avoid studying information warfare (and media ecology) itsef.    
https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1nekk60/the_irony/

And another "Irony" active irony poisoning posting. Wrapping fiction The Simpsons surreal absurd mind exploits around a murder. Kickind the MAGA community while they are down. Anti-compassion, anti-education, anti-teaching. Cheering that Russia keeps winning the information war since year 2013. The war against nonfiction, war against Reality as described September 9, 2014. Social media addicts ar thrilled to have Trump / MAGA ancticcs to contantly mock and call ironic and be sarcastic about. Normal healthy scientific thinking and leadership of society is considered boring and unattractive.

People on Reddit / other social platform (screenshot image) cheering on that they hope more will stop speaking in public in USA because of media performers selling fiction being shot (killed) in public (Charlie Kirk). Just like Bluesky and Reddit meme consumers are deport-happy / bloc-happy that content is censored  (suppressed) that they ego disagree with or do not understand. A USA society where chilling of political speech and removal of science facts, removal of discussion that Reddit s manipulated by Russia goes on. Because people want entertainment *they like* and want to block out fiction content they do not like.

Irony / Absurd / Surreal behaviors over Charlie Clerk (media content creator, influencer) are staring media addicts of Reddit in the face - but people can not connect all this MAGA cult as a media cult to Putin's Internet Research Agency year 2013 / Cambridge Analytica media mind-fuck 2013 onward... people say "it is a cult" on Reddit, but when do they go to the public library and start posting on Reddit quotes from NON-FICTION books about cult behaviors and cult deprogramming? Charlie Kirk is a media cult, Fox News is a media cult, Reddit is a media cult, Twitter (Elon MUsk) is a media cult, Truth Social is a media cult, The Bible is a media cult!

The recency bias, disconnect from reality, surreal is right in front of everyone. Recency bias of not reacalling 3 months ago in the constant streamine meme amusement mills. Yet, people aren't taking the crisis seriously and recognizing that hte very power of Putin Kremlin and Trump White House is build on constantaly mentally overloading / over-stresing the information intake of We The People.  No defense has been found against SUrkovian governing technqiues, Putin has been in power for 25 years using these techniques on domestic Russia!

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1ng9c3n/mainstream_media_has_failed_us/    
ONLY the mainsteram media. Reddit has been around since middle of year 2005, more than two decades. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit since year 2013, and people message that it is the *mainsteram* media ONLY. Truth Social is owned by Donald Trump / Elon Musk owns Twitter - the richest man in the worl with the media platform (Twitter) that all other media systems quote and screenshot. People don't even quesiton how Bluesky is funded and who is behind it. The reddit owners don't post public warnings of IRA Kremlin activities on Reddit and openly let hostile nations deply manipulation. Worst of all, any invocation of Neil Postman on Reddit gets ignored. Not front-page explaining the probelms of Fox Nwes (this Reddit posting I am commenting about references Fox News). Why isn't reddit making "the little guy" Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News a non-stop topic every 3 days since 2015 / March 2016 when it was wide release? Because amusement-washing at the Reddit humor mill of non-name accounts / hidden identity open to Kremlin is too busy joking and laughing at Donald Trump's performances of antics politics / Tony Cliftion techniques along with Surkov students of the Kremlin!   


&nbsp;
