Self-own AGAIN hours later, same topic. "Clever comeback" framing. The USA is self-owning with avoidance of Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death". The brainrot is social media addiction. People who think *owning* the Libs, *owning RFK Jr* with messages is clever. We are drowning in cleverness as 1940 film Great Dictator speech describes: "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

The irony, the paradox, the contradiction. Reddit eats this up. A fiction media content creator, Charlie Kirk, was murdered. So fiction content creator leaders chime in.

"Irony" on front page of Reddit. Nobody discussing that the NRA was documented to have worked with / infiltrated by Russia in information war. That Russia manipulated anti-vaccination. USA has had ass kicked in information war documented by multiple NATO nations, and all people can do is hate upon the mentally injured and manipulated that Putin won. That's exactly what (the mindsets that) the information warfare conditioned: Americans hate upon Americans and avoid Russia learning / avoid studying information warfare (and media ecology) itself.    
https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1nekk60/the_irony/

And another "Irony" active irony poisoning posting. Wrapping fiction The Simpsons surreal absurd mind exploits around a murder. Kicking the MAGA community while they are down. Anti-compassion, anti-education, anti-teaching. Cheering that Russia keeps winning the information war since year 2013. The war against nonfiction, war against Reality as described September 9, 2014. Social media addicts ar thrilled to have Trump / MAGA antics to constantly mock and call ironic and be sarcastic about.

Charlie Kirk is a media cult, Fox News is a media cult, Reddit is a media cult, Twitter (Elon Musk) is a media cult, Truth Social is a media cult, The Bible is a media cult!

The recency bias, disconnect from reality, surreal is right in front of everyone. Recency bias of not recalling 3 months ago in the constant streaming meme amusement mills. Yet, people aren't taking the crisis seriously and recognizing that the very power of Putin Kremlin and Trump White House is build on constantly mentally overloading / over-stressing the information intake of We The People.  No defense has been found against Surkovian governing techniques, Putin has been in power for 25 years using these techniques on domestic Russia!

ONLY the mainstream media. Reddit has been around since middle of year 2005, more than two decades. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit since year 2013, and people message that it is the *mainstream* media ONLY. Truth Social is owned by Donald Trump / Elon Musk owns Twitter - the richest man in the world with the media platform (Twitter) that all other media systems quote and screenshot. People don't even question how Bluesky is funded and who is behind it. The Reddit owners don't post public warnings of IRA Kremlin activities on Reddit and openly let hostile nations deeply manipulation. Worst of all, any invocation of Neil Postman on Reddit gets ignored. Not front-page explaining the problems of Fox News (this Reddit posting I am commenting about references Fox News). Why isn't Reddit making "the little guy" Jen Senko's 2015 film about Fox News a non-stop topic every 3 days since 2015 / March 2016 when it was wide release? Because amusement-washing at the Reddit humor mill of non-name accounts / hidden identity open to Kremlin is too busy joking and laughing at Donald Trump's performances of antics politics / Tony Clifton techniques along with Surkov students of the Kremlin!

The hate of humanism with the promotion of Trump hate / Trump mockery / Trump dehumanization FOR OVER TEN YEARS, day after day, constantly in media.  And Americans are going to behave *shocked* that the rest of the world has had enough of Trump American hate, bullshit, falsehoods, lies, anti-humanism, anti-love and pro-disease RFK Jr, pro-hate Pentagon, pro-hate Truth Social, pro-hate Americans are better than all the rest of the world bullshit Trump messaging systems.

Instead of using social media systems, spare time and free time, media addicts want the conflicts to continue because they are so addicted to the entertainment aspects of total mockery.

Reddit society and the screen captured messages (which are not Reddit) both suffer from mind-fuck by Russia to ignore Russia. The evidence of multiple NATO nations, which did not elect a black skin color President, having a media invasion since Russia. The behavior of measles and RFK Jr and the behavior of COVID-19 has nothing to do with black skin color. Yet, Russian information warfare and China DOES have something to do with measles and COVID-19. Reddit society is so happy and thrilled dunking on and hating upon MAGA that people can not grasp information warfare at all anymore. Emotional shit-flinging way worse than skin color. White on white education competition. All the sports-competition around university (Steely Dan Deacon Blues) and all the degree prestige competition around education has made insulting and mocking rural people for ignorance... and Reddit shows the worst kind of ignorance on the subject. People on Reddit are consonantly referencing that a billionaire, which Reddit users cite as a source of problem, runs Fox News, and that information warfare from Fox News has harmed rural less-educated people. And what about domestic Russia? Did Putin get voted out and replaced with a black skin color leader and is that why rural Russian people support invading and harming Ukraine? Because black skin color? My god, people can't study domestic Russian television and Surkov techniques of media systems in Russia - and compare how they are similar to Fox News. And learning from 9/11, even when it is the same race /even when it is the same skin color / Muslim on Muslim violence is about media systems of Quran fiction media. Malala getting shot on her school bus and her schools being blown up (which is more than just one girl shooting which you might attribute to bad luck) because of Radio Mullah she documents - did you think at age 14 she knew of Rush Limbaugh radio? Media, media,media, education, media. Billionaires and elders (Muallah) in media. Putin is a billionaire!

Front-page Reddit message also from other media platforms. *Deep down they know to blame*. No, I see zero demonstration that people know to blame Putin's multiple-nation media invasion since March 2013. People are not blaming egomania / egoism by name. People are not blaming Russian Internet Research Agency by name. People can't name Surkov techniques and methods (Surkov students). People instead just pick the most superficial and shallow answer "deep down", the OPPOSITE of deep understanding, but blaming Americans for everything going to shit. NOTHING IN UNTIED STATES OF AMERICA could be more OBVIOUS than a New York City Penthouse (Top floor of Trump Tower) PLAYBOY is a CITY SLICKER with a NEW YORK CITY FOX NEWS RUPERT MURDOCH. NOTHING COULD EVER BE MORE BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS. What changed is the Internet Research Agency and the blinding light of the Apple iPhone / Apple iPad devices into rural minds of people who never studied New York City / Manhattan teaching from Professor Neil Postman at New York University. It is the absence of MEDIA ECOLOGY that people don't understand Bible Verse "1 John 3:17", even the clergy can't teach Matthew 6:5 as they see Trump pose with The Bible in front of a Church for photo opportunity. We have a runaway Russian media simulacra launched in Q2 2013! I am a published author in message systems, I worked for Bill Gates and Paul Allen doing their private personal messaging systems! I am not some casual! I traveled to North Africa (Algeria) for the Arab Spring at the start of December 2010 to study media ecology before the Arab Spring became world famous hot/origin in Tunisia. I moved over to Amman Jordan in March 2011 to study the Syria war outbreak for years / media ecology online vs. HDTV news vs. people conversations / behaviors / attitudes.

For sake of clarity: "owned" means "addicted to Tony Clifton mocking", being audience members who mock and insult Tony Clifton acts - often calling Clifton performances as {terrible dumb idiots stupid}, Eating the Surkovian onions without any self-awareness that the most sophisticated military information warfare is exploiting their mind.

And people with free time and spare time to comment on social media can't create a movement to nicely educate the society on law and reform laws. Instead, social media people have used spare time since March 2013 to suck down Russian information warfare and adopt Donald Trump style use of social media: mocking, insulting, low-effort low-thinking trash-talk communications on computers capable of much more. Democracy has turned into Russian Ukraine hate just as the IRA intended... an entertainment at dehumanizing the rural low-education Americans who could have been saved if social media would stop insulting and mocking (Like Trump and Musk) and help out low-educated lawyers and low-comprehension low-understanding voters appreciate WHY America was great - and not just worship Putin billionaire ringleader working with Trump billionaire ringleader. Billionaires and wealth concentration alone are not what made USA great and progressive. Yet,the wealth lords provide the entertainment sports games and entertainment video games and entertainment big budget TV shows (Star Wars Andor) that big wealth advertisers and sports.... and social media society eats it up. Competitive hate and insulting on Reddit that the IRA keeps feeding 2013 onward became entertainment to people. A sick nation that can't resist feeding Russian values right back at Trump: the religion faiths of hate the poor rural Americans. Hate itself became the faith system of Reddit social media people with their spare time and free time being used to create hate comments on very post joining in with IRA programming to do so. Mind-fucked by one all recognition into behaving just as Donald Trump was mind-fucked to hate progress and goodness.

Reddit wants a message that says you don't need to change how audiences think. When practically every Reddit comment is entertainment / mocking / mickey / amusement / comedy just like Donald Trump is comedy / Putin Surkov techniques are comedy. Stewart does not grasp that USA lost a meme war and Putin won to induce self-harm by praise of humor and absurd. The jokes will wash away the killings. People are willing to due for dumb jokes, Reddit already proved that against the Internet Research Agency. Stewart even joked his own children didn't enjoy authentic learning in school like Malala, and nor does Reddit society.

The high road was teaching Neil Postman and Peter P, not mocking on  meme sites for 10 years. Standing up for mocking isn't ANY high road, it is a low raod We The People took at Russia's direction.

This is how Surkov and Putin governing has worked in Russia for 25 years! Mind-fucking via symbolism and images and patterns of monomyth.

Is it a problem, yes. It is the BIGGEST problem in the nation, no. Is it being MADE INTO the biggest problem so that terrible and bad solutions can be applied without using reason thinking... yes. This is media content to TEACH morality of "wrong", this is a morality lesson on the front page of Reddit. That it is wrong to help a South American pregnant woman. Ok, what if a USA pregnant woman was in Chile, where I lived in year 2004 for 12 months with my fertile wife. And waving around the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible, why can't Bluesky and Reddit social media society start teaching Bible literacy to ALL people in the world, the entire World Wide Web, that there is a LITERACY PROBLEM of people not grasping Bible verse "1 John 4:20", "1 John 3:17" in the science fiction story, and not translating Force Ghosts 1977 Star Wars to Bible angels, and Hamlet's Ghost to Bible angels and Moses outer space alien signals. Science fiction storytelling of Torah, Bible, Quran, And STOP hate. [*All hate* is bad, The 1954 Equation](../../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md)! Isn't the Christmas story about a pregnant woman who needed medical care and attention while not in her home / family? We need to be teaching remedial morality of how to understand these science fiction stories of the Levant! Why can't Reddit stand up and let Malala speak for women and lead pregnant women in a hospital movement, instead of a white man. Exactly what is not *good enough* about [Malala's reformations and education of women being given a voice in world affairs](https://malala.org/news-and-voices/malala-world-assembly-of-women-speech) and how hospitals for pregnancy work when traveling between South American nations and North American nations? Airports and other technology changes mean we need reformations on these issues and intelligent educators and teachers like Malala is communicating to the whole world! This *morality lesson* of bad and good, "wrong", is on the front page and Reddit is not using the SUSTAINED REPEATING of front-page to make assert morality reforms of actually goodness. This is badness itself, hate-motivated, not goodness!

Hate for hate, fuck you, on front page. Exactly the "fuck you" others did with the cake. Just spreading hate around. Hate needs to be ADDRESSED at the fundamental level in society. Also note the laughing, amusement-washing, LOL-washing, laugh-washing of harming people - and filing it for content to share. Reddit society sees this and jumps on the hate train, cut out others, build the walls between Palestine and Israel - block them out - but it does not deal with the absence of love, the avoidance of love, the abandonment of love, and the parenting and toxic clergy and hate-signal leaders like Putin and Trump. We are 8 billion people and we have a common programming and teaching and education problem. Hate. The 1954 Equation is staring us in the face every day on every topic. It is not in any way "fixed" that laugh-washing dehumanization and hate is a training ground on Reddit, Bluesky, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter. Step up and be SERIOUS about Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan and stop chuckle-washing LOL-washing serious problems of ALL HUMANITY parenting and education that Malala is addressing with scholing reform, clergy reform.

The paradox of the Fox News message will blow the minds of the Reddit audience, as expected, paradox mind blowing that it is spelled out.

The police have rules about being able to force people into police cars and into jail and prison. Normal everyday people can't force people into cars and prison. People do not see this is Russian Surkovian techniques of "War Against Reality" and call it as such.

Recency bias is so horrific in USA society. People removed Donald Trump from office, voted him out and he was replaced with Joe Biden. The endless media stimulation, addiction to fiction storytelling, is driving Reddit and USA society in total. Endlessly mocking and insulting Tony Clifton acts / President Tony Clifton.

Sarcasm, Irony, Paradox staring Reddit community in the face. Everything Neil Postman said in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about detachment via Twitter media ecology. These are Twitter messages. But Reddit does the same thing, so Reddit audience can't see their own behavior of turning all important and serious things about life into entertainment amusement joke. Just a matter of star-ratings and changing minds. No core values of goodness. Fiction addiction mindset, that real life events should all be turned into entertainment. And when people are entertaining or good enough, you dehumanize LIVING REAL PEOPLE, and not the system of media. People still love the Twitter media machines and Reddit media machines, but have abandoned loving human persons. Machine lust, humans are hate. Throwing out people, filling minds with media trash.

&nbsp;

Here is the paradox on the front page of Reddit:   

https://old.reddit.com/r/Snorkblot/comments/1o92vvl/at_the_bottom/

but Reddit users can't imagine that billionaires like Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk with media empires aren't manipulating popularity on Reddit itself. Elon Musk has his own ISP (Starlink), datacenters for X / SpaceX / Tesla automobiles / Grok AI training, tons of skilled people... and Reddit users that prize disposable accounts and banning think that real people speaking up against the monster state values (corporate and government in October 2025) aren't being targeted by mystery moderators on Reddit? That fake reports of comments and users aren't driving removal? And the anti-forgiveness policies of dehumanization - secret police of admins and moderators who remove content. 

The community has no sense of how bad things are already and how long it has been gong on. I used to work for the richest people in the entire world in Bellevue Washington in media systems. NFL and NBA sports owners, I was there with all the inside Edward Snowden level access to how media systems and apps are used by the wealthiest people in the world. I traveled to Algeria in Africa and to Jordan in the Middle East to study the media ecology / social media of the Arab Spring. I'm on the billionaire shit list because I stood up to the Halloween documents and the Rupert Murdoch / Elon Musk / Putin media systems techniques / the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica. Yet Reddit users can not see how often nonfiction is avoided. Even links to Wikipedia are banned / removed / forbidden all over Reddit. The constant focus on low-effort disposable "sounds good" commenting that drives society in total / Truth Social values.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There you go, right on the front page. Joke-washing. The black tape. Using humor exploits, amusement exploits, to create alternate realities. Reddit community itself is ground zero for joke-washing amusement-washing Putin and Trump, Surkovian governing for over 10 years. And here is a joke-washing they see, but there is no self-awareness on Reddit that the commenting laugh-tracks / mockery-tracks are used to Joke-wash Trump with billionaire scale patterns.      
https://old.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1o94a9n/hasans_failed_coverup_of_shocking_kaya_is_a_big/

&nbsp;

There it is again, "funny names" right in the posting quote. Amusement washing, funny washing, joke-washing of Reality. Surkovian governing. Reddit society can not see that Reddit comment sections are ground-zero for washing away serious nonfiction reality with funny names. "Agent Orange", etc.       
https://old.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1o91hb2/actor_bradley_whitford_i_am_living_in_a_world/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Paradox mind-fucks the Reddit audience. People uneducated in nonficiton learning of Kremlin methods, Surkovian.  
https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1o93hzl/how_do_you_feel_about_jd_vance_calling_the_young/nk104i4/    
it is a mass media technique of child-washing serious problems and situations, because children are innocent in the minds of people. The same thing goes on here constantly by tools Putin who call Trump a "baby", "child", and call Elon Musk a "child" - it casts them as not responsible for their adult choices and actions. Cambridge Analytica level stuff, beyond Edward Bernays. You see these messages constantly about Telegram (the leak from Young Republicans) and Bluesky / Reddit. Morality-washing on a scale never seen before in information warfare. The IRA really did a number on the hearts and minds in USA. I also see constant signals of dementia-washing - that people are not responsible for their negative hate and dehumanization - because they have physical brain disorders. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1o98e7h/til_in_2013_the_president_of_turkmenistan_fell/

On Reddit people will dunk on this, but on Bluesky and Reddit both people constantly report messages to the Reddit secret police for removal / censorship. I've logged censored messages of mine on this GitHub. People block each other. Can't even face reality of a horse fall, can't face reality of a Unicode message on a comment section. Egomania prized.

&nbsp;

MAGA calling everyone "stupid, dumb, idiots" right here on the front page of Reddit. And that's exactly what Reddit calls MAGA "stupid, dumb idiots", everyone using low-effort media addictions, TikTok video clips. Just like Carl Sagan said in 1995. A professional teacher and media content creator who KNEW that 10-second sound bites in 1995 were gong to wreck the future.

Hate clergy, hate prized, hate values. Everything MLK Jr' said about hate abandoned again and again. Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton has thrived off feedback loops of hate for hate. For over TEN YEARS AND FOUR MONTHS, always more hate. Hate of immigrants, hate of nonfiction book reading, hate of people who watch media other than Fox News, all met with more hate. Wrecking the USA by everyone advancing the technology systems and techniques of hate. Goodness itself abandoned. Nonfiction serious learning in the face of pandemic, abandoned. Hate prized.

Reddit media consumers prize low-effort trash commenting and are infamous for not reading the articles. And links in comments are often forbidden, censored. WikiTribune ignored along with other anti-refinement efforts with information - in favor of low-effort disposable commenting about critical and important topics. Speed of information, Carl Sagan on 10-second sound bites, ignored time and time again about Twitter and Bluesky and TikTok. No quotes from Neil Postman on entertainment-wrapping, meme-wrapping. And well, the IRA invading Reddit itself with the no-identity no author name prizing of Reddit society commenting. Right vs. left brainrot one-bit logic. Fiction vs. nonfiction better explains the USA news crisis. Advertising isn't making things free, it is paid for by the wealthy. Reddit inclusive.

By the People for the People. A society that abandons nonfiction is a self-deception society. Prizing entertainment and bullying methods of communication above all else.

American, Atlanta Georgia, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave us the worlds in year 1954 - they are on WikiQuotes - and people on social media can't be bothered to teach each other and stand up for goodness.

But somehow Reddit and Bluesky have convinced that machine blocking and machine deportation of people is far more "fun" than actual compassion and love.

"grooming", as in sexual grooming? No, this is indoctrination. The "murdered by words" response is ignorant of how Levant religions are done and how holy leaders, clergy, podcoasts. You don't learn about Batman except through fiction. Same with science fiction Bible and readers. People know of Levar Burton for book reading, and that's what Charlie Kirk is. The ignorance of media ecology is wrecking the nation. Japanese "Ash" is a fiction character from Japan. Media ecology is not magical or supernatural. It gets transported from Japan via technology means. Mecca and Mohamamd are NO WHERE NEAR Swat Valley, Pakistan, get out a map and study the transport of Quran to Pakistan. Media ecology literacy is not optional today! “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban.

The entertainment-washing of Trump on the front page of Reddit is constant. People in love with mimicking the behavior, media style, language, fashion of Donald Trump. The brand seared so deep into minds it is every aspect of society. A nation driven by media addiction, all cashing in on the unpopularity / popularity denial seams in the human brain.

Charlie Kirk image. Charlie Kirk is not a Nazi. Trump is not Adolph Hitler. This is not Germany. This is a media system / media ecology crisis of podcasters at a Mormon university. Podcasting didn't exist, live streaming by smartphone devices did not exist. Reddit images did not exist. People are prizing hate and prizing out-group hate. I have seen enough Trump prizing by Reddit since year 2013 to see hate itself is the problem. People think joke-wash humor-wash satire-wash Trump and will not face up to the problems of USA society year 2014, year 2015, the abandonment of reality in USA at the hands of meme mills and media-think. Shit prizing of shit ideas and a paths. Prizing hate. Prizing guns, Prizing killings. EVERY PERSON in the world needs to abandon hate and leave it behind. Prizing hate, teaching hate, *hate harder* is exactly how Putin defeated the USA via Reddit invasion.

Hot man photos. Luigi. Worship a murderer. A manipulator, a killer, a sneak-attack gun worshiper. Prizing hate, faith in hate, worship of hate. Instead of promoting the Second Bill of Rights in USA on social media since December 4, 2024 - promoting violence and hate. Anti-goodness prized. The only lesson being taught here is to prize dehumanization. Which health insurance in USA does, dehumanizes.

Comedy-washing Trump quotes as entertainment, front page of Reddit. Amusement mill, meme mill. addicts to everything as entertainment and comedy have taken over the nation. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", everything is humor. Comedy-washing.

&nbsp;

"Fun and memes", that's Reddit the amusement mill. That's "Amusing Ourselves To Death" as described in the 1985 book by Neil Postman. It is a TOTAL SOCIETY PROBLEM, ALL INCLUSIVE, 100%. Memes to death, joke-washing, meme-thinking, meme-mindset problem since year 2013. Surkov won.

Reddit society is against nonfiction expressed directly. Quotes, citations, links. Satire-washing Donald Trump society, meme-washing, amusement-washing, entertainment-washing everything. A simulacra mind-game of endlessly avoiding Wiki style refinement of common understanding in favor of fragmented "tactical cleverness" (1940 Great Dictator, 1951 Hannah A).

Sexual kissing fetish to see Donald Trump on front page. "definitely" non-descriptive title. There is endless audience demand for Trump images / content. No media star has changed so many minds to shit. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/1ogmnsb/where_are_these_people_hiding/

Minds BLOWN on Reddit society when reality comes into play. only the rich and famous like Musk and Trump and YouTube people use their REAL NAMES and REAL FACES. Because self-dehumanizing people is the media addiction. Anti-reality cult. Cult of Trump-washing real name, promoting REAL NAME of Donald Trump and all his nicknames, while self-dehumanizing non-famous non-rich non-wealthy non private jet people. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFilterNews/comments/1ogmeci/gop_senator_scrambles_to_walk_back_his_attack/

Right on the front page of Reddit, right on news networks: non-believers are terrorists. Malala's efforts since January 2009 ignored by society. No real learning about the media ecology crisis since September 11, 2001. Fiction vs. nonfiction. Addiction to fiction driving people into attack science thinking. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1ohqyu9/based_angry_joe/

"low IQ mocking", that's exactly what MAGA prizes, Trump prizes. People who use intelligence to game, trick, manipulate others. Microsoft is using intelligence to manipulate video game players.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1ohxgav/the_governor_urges_all_of_us_to_not_lose_the_plot/

It's not just a phrase. USA society lost the plot. Democracy does not work without love and compassion. MLK Jr's 1950's teachings about military and organization power were not to be ignored. You turn love into a competition of attraction and charm and you end up with competitive rat race winners like Putin. You don't listen to Leo B and you end up in a world without love and people wishing for rocks to smash into the Earth and destroy life and people cheering on climate change as a "tears of suffering" LOL LOL amusement.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1oj6hsc/state_of_twitter_right_now/

Amusement-washing humor-washing, framing as "politics entertainment humor" (subreddit) the information war. Everything with Trump is amusement to death since JUNE 16, 2015, FOR OVER TEN YEARS. [Neil Postman was correct in year 1985 about Reddit and Bluesky meme-washing entertainment-washing serious problems away to be ignored](../Specific/Postman_1985_Howdy_Doody.md) - and that was WITHOUT active measures! That in 1985 was describing the Reddit media ecology / media environment crisis WITHOUT active effort by Putin's army all over Reddit since year 2013. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1ojd332/that_is_the_true/

That's why people like Trump. He provides endless entertainment and amusement. People love horror story films, it's Halloween. People were bored with nonfiction leaders. People who hate Trump prize hate, it's a total society that values hate.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TopCharacterTropes/comments/1ojxrfe/hated_trope_whitewashing_atrocities_or_crimes_of/

Tripe of Films and TV shows. but on Social media site Reddit, ENDLESSLY downplaying via humor, jokes, amusement mind-blowing. Comedy-washing, satire-washing, joke-washing, humor-washing, amusement-washing. Irony-washing. Anything and everything to avoid The 1954 Equation as a sustained and focused topic since February 28, 1954.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/CringeTikToks/comments/1ok29hn/mike_johnson_unlike_the_democrats_republicans_do/

No, people are in no way waking up to the media ecology crisis of "LOL" (right on the Reddit posting is "LOL" laugh track). Neil Postman's 1985 "Amusing Ourselves To Death" book. People are amusement-washing humor-washing LOL-washing on Reddit. Mind-fucking themselves with Surkov information warfare on Reddit media venue. "The Media" is the mind-fuck of LOL amusement audience laugh track, to be constantly entertained and detached from reality. Putin won since year 2013 using LOL techniques. Denial abounds in USA.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1ok4obu/owning_the_libs_ends_up_owning_herself/

"Leopards Ate My Face" (subreddit name) **translates to same concern** as "owning the libs" ("owning the conservatives" / liberals, one-bit logic plairty brain-rot out-group). So this is about a war of "owning" each other. All fed by Russian simulacra patterns of Cambridge Analytica out-group hate since year 2013. It's all people in USA are concerned with, mocking Americans. Americans hate upon Americans and giggle and amuse themselves on meme mills Bluesky and Reddit about how funny it is to see USA people self-harm. No rescue from Putin's Internet Research Agency mind-fucking, just giggle LOL mindsets as conditioned. This is how Russia won / Surkov won since year 2013. Always messages of: *hate harder, mock harder, join the Totoal Mockery* created by the Kremlin. Anti-intellectual, anti-goodness, anti-empahty, anti-compassion, anti-rescue mindsets. Entertainment-washing of serious problems.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1ok0wsx/asmongold_says_america_is_white_peoples_land/

This is where adult get educated. Learning and education. On Rush Limbaugh shows. Meme mills like Reddit. Adults don't learn from nonfiction books, they are attracted to media venues of fiction entertainment like Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones shows. This is how Surkov won, Russia won, since year 2013. The abandonment of nonfiction as boring and nonfiction as unattractive.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ojvpqa/jd_vance_says_only_really_terrible_people/

And again first thing Friday October 31 morning front page:

https://old.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/1oktcta/jd_vance_says_only_really_terrible_people/

Halloween mind-fuck timing. South Park in their face less than 2 months ago reminding JD Vance of the dog killing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got_a_Nut  . Reddit society falls for Tony Clifton arctics of JD Vance and other media players around MAGA / Trump / Kremlin. Reddit society "eats the onion" tht it is **forgotten** and not a deliberate [contradiction vaudville act](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), not a deliberate Kremlin media technique, that it is not symptom of JD Vance needing rescued from Putin's mental programming. Surkov won since year 2013. Reddit society blows their minds on these media messages of paradox. Surkovian chess blows Reddit audience minds. 

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1ok4ep9/this_mf_is_a_garbage_person/

Font page of Reddit. Reddit society can't see We The People are in a media platform to media platform simulacra. A message feedback loop. Reddit title is calling Biden and Trump "garbage person", prizing hate. Hate for hate. Reddit cloud computing machines messaging that Trump Biden is **ugly**, etc. "Force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe." - November 17, 1957. Alabama.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1okspc5/if_youre_sincere_implement_trumpcare/

The paradox presented via Trump on social media: that "Biden economy" is responsible for economy and rising prices but not when Trump is in office is Trump responsible for the "Trump economy" and rising health care costs. Reddit users get their minds blown out by these Surkov media techniques, paradox messaging. It puts the Reddit audience into meme stupor, tiny-think reactionary mindsets, instead of asserting goodness like health care / housing / food with the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights in a complex well-thought-out package that also mentions the breeding ground for dictatorships... people just react to the low-effort of calling Trump stupid and dumb. Exactly what these Trump Surkov style messages do to audiences, blow the minds of people into simplistic reactions and waiting for the next Trump message  / antic  / action to react to.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1okwl7r/hasan_gets_mad_at_a_vietnamese_refugee_and_yells/

Right on the front page of Reddit. Prizing hate. Block-happy, deport-happy, media blocking, immigrant blocking / deporting. People prize hate for one person or another, one out-group or another. it's a global problem and free speech media systems allow it be expressed in clear language like Truth Social does. ... ... ...       
"Force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody.

https://old.reddit.com/r/goodnews/comments/1okspes/holy_cow_in_a_humiliating_reversal_rfk_jr_walks/

Surkovian onion eating that these antics, nonsense, are accidental. It is how you mentally invade the audience, make the audience feel they are smarter than the icon / symbol of power. To create a total mockery between leader and audience. Surkovian governing. It isn't accidental that RFK Jr was put in his position to serve Kremlin / Putin. It's endless entertainment to Reddit audience who blows their minds on the pattern of messages. "Holy Cow" mind blown like a Chicago Cubs sports entertainment amusement event. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" explains this Reddit audience media behavior / addiction to antics leaders. The constant stimulation of contradictory vaudeville performances politics. Surkov won, Russia won. NATO lost. 

&nbsp;

&npsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1ol7xkm/look_at_the_facts_charlie_kirk_was_not_a_good/

Correct. Which is wh you need to stop stating the very superficial obvious about Charlie Kirk and teach remedial morality. Bible verse "1 John 3:17" should be front in center about teaching love vs. hate. Reddit audience keeps blowing minds into meme-think Twitter-think simplicity. The problem is the widespread inversion of morality, goodness from badness. People are attracted to badness and this attraction needs to be discussed and become a topic itself. Not just to people, but content, anonymous Reddit message content, etc. Popularity itself has become badness / toxic.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1oladwj/jd_vance_tries_to_lean_into_one_of_his_many_memes/

Right in the Reddit and Bluesky JD Vance couch chanting faces. All week the South Park dog shooting and JD Vance has been slaying the Reddit audience. Those who hate JD Vance are doing exactly what Tony Clifton performances thrive off, audience hate. Surkov won.

What changed between then and now? 1. Wealth concentration. 2. Internet Research Agency year 2013. 3. Cambridge Analytia doctors altering mindsets. Bluesky and Reddit community reacts to the name "JD Vance" with couch mindsets... instead of social media society organizing / getting on the same page of the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights. 

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/CringeTikToks/comments/1onb9s7/reminder_grocery_prices_are_up_since_trump_took/

Reddit society will jump on dementia-washing... ignoring the Fox News problem since year 1996. People live in alternate information realities. Russian information warfare learning ignored. Disposable commenting society people not see that Fox News is sustained problem that requires sustained focus of social media society.

Yes, civilization Jihad is real. Abandonment of science in favor of fiction is real. Civilization jihad from Levant religions: look at Mexico City before the year 1492. The language and native Americas religion were both wrecked. Spanish was brought from Europe to Mexico. Roman Catholic religion was brought along with the Bible storytelling. People do not study nonfiction on these subjects. After September 11, 2001 - wealthy Saudi Arabian Bin Laden said. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life."- Al-Jazeera interview, (21 October 2001), "Bin Laden"

"takes up so much space in your head", yes - billionaires have mind-fucked the population into addiction to Trump. Doctors from Cambridge Analytica. Reddit eats it up, prizes the hate leadership of Trump and flocks to Trump's hate. Hate and mass dehumanization are common ground for the USA, every person prizing out-group hate. The 1954 Equation avoided. Same with Palestine and Israel, prizing of hate itself. Hate vs. hate.

Reddit society doesn't grasp the Joe Rogan media ecology that normalizes badness, Reddit society itself can't be serious and sustain focus on important topics in addition to mockery-washing. The whole nation has been sliding down into Hell mindsets, it isn't only Joe Rogan, isn't only Fox News, isn't only Twitter... it is all inclusive media audience, We The People, audience is the crisis. Sponge Bob entertainment-washing of Rogan. One entertainment-washing hand washes all the entertainment-washing hands.

Stephen Miller is exploiting the incredibly bad faith that the IRA and CA seeded since year 2013. Prizing of hate, prizing of mass dehumanization. The lies that I see all over Reddit that people took "The High Road". The high road is quoting MLK Jr and expounding on the ideas. The high road is Second Bill of Rights from January 1944, not chanting Luigi all year 2025. People behave as if the high road is worthless, below goodness. The only persistent faith is mocking and insulting. Once hate and mockery goes on long enough, it stops mattering who started it except for learning how to stop it. The attraction to hate has been so powerful. There is a fundamental failure of media ecology self-awareness that high-speed reactions have taken over behaviors.

I agree with most of what is said, except "always fuck the law", we need to reform laws, get rid of outdated and over-reaching laws, and all better understand the laws. Wiki style system for practical understanding of the motivations behind laws and the problems with them. A focus on progress and goodness. The way he says "I feel like I'm taking to my self" is core, people are all on different pages of social media (TikTik the origin of this posting video?) in filter-bubbles and have no sense of common goodness. What Neil Postman said about education and needing a common narrative. The IRA and CA mind-fucked everyone into scattered often superficial and shallow focus, not deeper focus on common direction. We are sheep, face up that sheep is good, if we aren't all marching into self-destruction and hate. If we are progress, all aboard the train / sheep line.

All over this GitHub you will see me making this point: Year 2012, year 2013 Malala on the world stage for 18 months. Malala Swat Valley Pakistan "trailer park" book published October 8, 2013 - one month later... November 8, 2013 Trump is in Moscow for Miss Universe showing off hot girls who live poor and are serving white male Putin and Trump. Society seriously cares about "Epstein List" because it is private jets, rich white men, sex affairs. Malala as a social media assertion is avoided. And MALALA deals with terrorism (October 7, 2023 a decade after her book), reform of Islam, Iran women, abortion rights (pro abortion on Malala fund website) for adult women, etc, ,etc, etc. Pro-science education. Not just SEX, but giving blog voices to young girls to DEFEND against the wealth lords like Musk / Putin / Trump / Murdoch! But Reddit audience can not see this addiction to rich white men mocking and all the repetition messaging over "Epstein" - and not giving even MORE SERIOUS attention to Malala's girls. People are attracted to the the entertainment Tony Clifton amusement "milking the LOL cow" of Trump more than dealing with the power imbalance between trailer park and NYC penthouse kids.

This is everything Neil Postman wrote about in 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", it is not amusing! This is Finnegans Wake media ecology, year 1924 onward. This is Tower of Babel in your face. People are living different realities based on the filter bubble of media they consume. There is no winning with child sex, this is all about media consumption. The AUDIENCE of voters isn't all having sex with thier 13 year olds, or it isn't being documented? But one thing IS DOCUMENTED - the *media ratings* of Reddit, Facebook, Bluesky, Fox News, Church donations. People are all getting widly conflicting views of language itself.

Claims that it isn't trivializing it seem insincere when since year 2013 Malala has been asking the whole world to stop avoiding direct attention and focus on young girls. (Reallly since January 2009, but Malala became famous in 2012, book published 2013). People keep asserting sex photos of old white men instead of empowering education and giving power to the least empowered people to grow We The People power globally.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1oxauzl/how_is_it_a_hoax_if_theyre_conducting_a_real/

Another front page example. "Hoax" means war against reality. Addiction to fiction, addiction to entertaining Reality TV (which is fiction) is driving society. Trump is the center of attention because he provides constant drama / fiction storytelling / sex acts / abuse to discuss. Goodness has been abandoned since June 16, 2015. Reddit society is full of people who can't resist mocking President Tony Clifton acts / contradictions / Surkov governing techniques. The only stable thing being produced is high-speed media systems, "the media", Reddit media, Bluesky media, constantly talking about the bewildering anti-reality warfare Putin and Trump have created. What's being avoided is asserting goodness. Luigi 11 months ago murdering someone in Manhattan hasn't addressed health care. People won't quote nonfiction books about health insurance and health care as much as they will repeat low-effort Luigi with guns / Luigi with a cigarette meme-think. It's all entertainment / amusement. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is reality that people need to face up or we just keep racing to the bottom of junk information content on high-speed systems. The notification and back and forth likes / upvotes / commenting is consuming society. Touch machine devices are getting the love, not poor and "least of these" humans. The rich famous people are the center of media attention / social media attention / Reddit attention. The power is in the media addictions itself. Trump knew this in year 2013, Putin and Surkov knew this 25 years ago.

Another indication of upside down / ass-backwards Bible reading. But wrap it in more meme venues. Don't rescue Donald Trump and MAGA from Russian mind-fuck. Milk the amusement out of Trump being mind-fucked by Putin. Surkov won. IRA and CA won. The behavior regarding cheering on abusing children and homeless isn't just one single person. Morality crisis is entire nation.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1oxtee2/oh_myyyyy/

Trump is in no way lazy about dominating words. Taking words right out of the mass mind / mass man / hive mind of USA and making thme his own. Trump rewrites meaning and language. Reddit eats it up. This isn't defending! Finnegans Wake is defending! Putin and Surkov have run circles around USA since year 2013.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/cursedcomments/comments/1oxqh1a/cursed_powerscaling/

Trump is worshiped, Trump is a role model. My god people have no sense of how long they have flocked to "milk the LOL cow" of Trump since June 16, 2015. The endless "joke milking" / "amusmenet milking" of Trump. Morality-milking. People suck off the teet of Trump providing values. The core faiths people prize are: hate, dehumanization, mocking, high-speed meme delivery, low-effort Twitter commenting, "for the lulz" addiction.

Anti-NATO and Reddit community still can't connect the dots to year 2013 onward War Against Reality by Surkov and Putin. People just see tree after tree, but no forest. Bizarre, unreal, fiction addicts give each episode ratings and reviews as entertainment, not as a wrecking of the world through organized information warfare. Surkov won, Russia won. Reddit audience amusement-washes entertainment-wraps all this as content to mock.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1oy1ixa/we_all_knew_it_would_end_this_way_prepare/

Which is why I keep observing how low the bar is. Getting rid of Trump for Trump sex crimes doesn't deal with MAGA / JD Vance / Putin. People believe nonsense on all media platforms. Fox News since year 1996. People have to actually desire reform of media consumerism / values / morality. Bible literacy (comprehension) that can't find verse "1 John 3:17" and apply it to Trump / Musk / Murdoch.

All over Reddit and Bluesky, I see the attitude that speaking out of turn, writing comments or posting on social media - that are wrong should be banned / blocked / prevented. Which is the same sort of message billionaires are feeding about protesting being bad. Messaging against the crowd is treated as bad. MLK Jr made a huge point of this. "Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted." - good from bad. If a billionaire is promoting goodness, I'm not against it, but they almost always are not. I'm also not in favor of protests that promote badness. The Beatles song "Revolution", if you have minds that hate...

SURKOVIAN_CHESS CHESS_1024D Exactly, they aren't dumb and stupid, they are following Putin's model that has worked for over 25 years. ... ... ...     
"The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it climbs inside all ideologies and movements, **exploiting and rendering them absurd**. One moment Surkov would fund civic forums and human rights NGOs, the next he would quietly support nationalist movements that accuse the NGOs of being tools of the West. With a flourish he sponsored lavish arts festivals for the most provocative modern artists in Moscow, then supported Orthodox fundamentalists, dressed all in black and carrying crosses, who in turn attacked the modern art exhibitions. The Kremlin’s idea is to own all forms of political discourse, to not let any independent movements develop outside of its walls. Its Moscow can feel like an oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia, year 2014

People do not **understand or comprehend** how Russia has mind-fucked the mass man into competitition. Humiliating and mocking others is not the same as comprehending and understanding issues and concerns. Of course a society that supports the most difficult 30%, the most troubled, is more labor and cost. Humanism is standing up for the weak and difficult. Not mocking and insulting.

If people can mock how weak and poorly equipped the Russian army is, it's so funny and entertaining and amusing to wash away the human badness with meme-think chuckles!

As long as people can mock "MAGA leopards faces" over and over annd over, it's funny to have your nation smashed with self-harm behaviors! This is the human brain exploit that I credit Surkov for recognizing and explouding upon in his fiction storytelling. Surkov cracked the monomyth mind exploits of God casting lightning and thunder down upon humans to make them bow to the wealth lords / land lords / power lords of Putin and Trump /etc. Monomyth depth mind-fucking cracked by Surkov!

Reddit audience is pushed around and driven by the Internet Research Agency since March 2013. Reddit society can't speak the names of the players, Surkov, every day... or comment Jen Senko's name. Reddit audience mocks and mocks and mocks at Donald Trump and White House for over a decade. As Surkov students conditioned since March 2013. Surkov won, We The People (all, not just one-third, not just Republicans, not just MAGA) lost. NATO lost. September 9, 2014.. BEFORE this year 2016 video CNN released: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ Reddit society has had more than ELEVEN FULL YEARS to repeat and comment repeating this September 9, 2014 link. But Reddit audience won't *get on the same page* of Wiki style important assertions, keep an eye on the NATO ball, keep an eye on the Ukraine information war since September 9, 2014 posting of that story on The Atlantic world wide web site.

AND ANOTHER GOD DAMN FUCKING BLUNT POINT ABOUT THIS CNN UNREPORTED VIDEO: The man creating the confusing media paradox isn't age 79 dementia. It isn't a 79 year old male with dementia. DID YOU HEAR THAT? [Fox News vs. CNN **media ecology** (Reddit vs. Facebook) is what you all / we all need to fucking focus on](../../Ted_Koppel.md)... We The People need to focus on Neil Postman's library of teachings. We The People need to stop the "dementia washing" of one single person, Trump. Elon Musk and his chainsaw antics of D.O.G.E. is a topic of Reality TV media ecology Reality Twitter media ecology - not DEMENTIA AGE 79! Why isn't REDDIT AUDIENCE putitng down the video games and egaging the REAL WORLD information warfare since March 2013 that Russia won? Why isn't REDDIT COMMUNITY / BLUESKY COMMUNITY multi-author creating **a Wiki** (with edit history and real contributor names) of top 20 AND top 100 points to FOCUS ON about Trump, and a WEEKLY NEWSLETTER OF "We THE PEOPLE MAGA Woke"?

A CALL to INTELLECTUAL arms. Not physical weapons (Reddit Bluesky December 4 Luigi bullshit), **information defense** weapons against Surkov students. Education, teaching, pro-Malala. "ALL GET ON THE SAME GOD-DAMNED PAGE, WIKI REFINED".

Mind-fuck after mind-fuck to an audience that can name technical of everything about military weapons, guns, all the proper names and brands of a gun in a Hollywood film... but can't name Rupert Murdoch, and audience who can't name Surkov. Mind-fucked into hardware gun brand names / "clip vs. magazine" naming, but can't name the architect human being Surkov of their own mind-fuck. Gender topics. White elderly men ruling (Taliban stayle over Malala Swat Valley Pakistan) over women and claiming paradox memes otherwise. 

Kremlin podium right into the brains of Reddit audience meme addicts / touch device addicts intimate with their touches of downvoting in raging egoism / self-centered tree after tree nut picking, cherry avoiding.

Reddit audiences eat this up and can not name "Internet Research Agency" or Surkov. People who use Reddit can name every hardware military device part of guns and weapon systems, the proper ammunition of a physical hardware kiilling device and their creators. But cannot name Surkov in mind-fucking via Reddit media / social media Surkov manipualtion techniques! There is no self-awarenss on social media systems of organized mental manipulation beyond parroting thought-ending phrases like "bot".

https://old.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1pfg1z0/nancy_sinatra_responds_to_false_claim_about_her/

Front page of Reddit. The reason I do this GitHub is this Reddit society behavior, this Bluesky society behavior (that I witness but do not document here). Short quip-like "gotcha". The very kind of "clickbait" and shit-posting shit-commenting shit-Twitter that in year 2013 would have been criticized by self-aware Reddit society. Frank Sinatra / Donald Trump entertainment figures, all that LOL attitudes towards such a person being President. Yet, the Fox News / Rush Limbaugh issue year 2013 problem was known, but not taken as a long-term threat.

PEOPLE CHANGED in USA,ALL PEOPLE, not just { MAGA / Rural Republicans / Christians in USA / Voting Republicans / Baby boomers } - but Reddit users, Twitter users, Facebook users... EVERYBODY changed in year 2014. Things have not returned. As year 2025 is coming to a close, people have lost all sense / situational awareness on long-term scale. { Rural Americans, Rural Republicans, "Red areas", "Red states" } think of New York City **city slickers** - a braggard man in a business suit is SLEAZY. Someone who doesn't like country music, doesn't serve in military. WAKE UP READER OF THIS page!

That is why I created this GitHub. People in year 2025 are asleep in the way James Joyce saw us walking into "Christian religion of love and turn the other cheek" became World War One and World War Two. Finnegans Wake / Finn Hotel year 1923, and earlier Joyce lectures and quotes.  "Woke Finnegan", "The Dead" of Dublin, the metaphors of year 1923 "Woke", "Wake the fuck up","Get Woke World".

That is why I created this GitHub: Rural farmers, Rural republicans, "Red area voters" - why trust SLEAZY Donald Trump? Baby boomers knew of sleazy real estate golf course owners.  That is why I created this GitHub: SOMETHING on a SCALE never experienced by United States of America before was going on. SLEAZY "City Slicker" was now attractive to rural Americans / Red voters.

That is why I created this GitHub: 1) Apple iPhone 2007 mocked at first by rural, by year 2012 previously avoidant of "nerd" behaviors - was now normal and adopted by rural populations in USA. Social media. 2) Russian Internet Research agency 2013. 3) Reach of IRA to rural,previously inexperienced Internet / computer media avoiders, for first time in USA history. Direct Russia media publishing to rural previously isolated Americans who were new to memes and social media culture. 3) Cambridge Analytica doctors of the mind. 4) Rural population not knowing New York City / Manhattan / New York University **Neil Postman's** 1985 criticism of Cowboy Hat California/ Cowboy Hat Ronald Reagan. Trump is NOT that persona of Rural, but a city slicker.But the **Neil Postman** emphasis is the shift away from printed books to electronic meme networks in 1985. Electronic, high-speed,  electric media.The Marshall McLuhan Canada insights applied to USA NYC Fox News and IRA / CA meme cultures of electric media thrills. Meme euphoria for rural farmers, electric media drugs-like stimulation. That is why I created this GitHub. Russia won, Surkov students won hearts and minds.

Endlessly iterating the list. How many times does Reddit hive mind have to flock to the "When you are a media star, you can grab them by the pussy" entertainment-washing wells? Yes, Epstein, yes it's on the Reddit hive mind all the time. Study Marshall McLuhan "mass man" mental exploits for rock star groupie girls / young actresses / Michael Jackson's sake! Iterating little girl topics over and over. Active Measures from Putin and Trump against media addicts of Hollywood pros. Reddit audience eats it up. Why not make Pussy Riot the constant repeating topic on Reddit, adult women speaking and giving voice to young girls? Why not Malala from Swat Valley having former abused girls for adult topic discussions sent to Reddit for AMA?

https://old.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1pjmd3k/americans_must_learn_to_adjust_to_a_lower/

Americans have adjusted to endless mocking. Day after day complaining and complaints about how dumb the USA is on meme devices. Again and again, ignoring getting on the same page - call for everyone to sustain focus and repeat assertion - of "dumb" problem of social media / electric media. ... ... ...       
“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

The issue isn't silence on these topics. Left right brainrot aside. The issue is sustained focus. People scream and react loud at Trump behavior, but it's like all year 2025 with Luigi murder in Manhattan. People could have spent year 2025 posting actual insurance paperwork, one person every 6 hours, on Bluesky and Reddit. But that's organized and intelligent and not gun-worship murder thrill-seeking. Fox News and Newsmax repeat their anti-goodness messages. And silence isn't the issue vs. screaming rage... the screaming rage from MAGA / Fox News audience is what got us here! People need to be able to assert humanism and quality in dialog and not dehumanize / *Hate harder* messages. We have to all agree that goodness is actually good. Putin and Trump meeting in Alaska and all now the anti-EU  topics of the past week - we are so far lost in Putin's information warfare. People don't even see that goodness isn't being asserted. Endless mocking. Epstein chanting (worship icon) created so much noise and loudness.

Trump is yanking the chain / heart strings of the people who believe QAnon "Q" stuff without even realizing they are chasing Epstein / Trump Jr. / programming. Remove Trump, reform MAGA, THEN go after Epstein files. Starting with the Epstein files is a flash dance / sexual strip tease of information and only information. "Q Drops" are practices with the MAGA audience, and now it is MAGA everywhere Reddit. The denial on Reddit of addiction to Pizza Gate fantasy topics / Q information strip tease drips is now extreme in year 2025. 

* “a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992

Reddit society is the washing meme mill of turning Trump into a topic of mockery entertainment. White house mocks, Reddit mocks back, feedback looping over and over since June 16, 2015. In or out of office, golf course or Mar-A-Lago or anywhere, Reddit chases images of Trump to mock and insult his President Tony Clifton SNL performances. Reddit audiences eat and pre-digest it for the rest of the Internet to regurgitate. 

The social relationships of Reddit audience with Trump / Truth Social (Untrue social) is that there is no sense of time. It is like Trump's casino floors, time is only relative "comment 13 minutes ago", there is no sense of Forest for the Trees, as it is constantly disappearing outdated posts (hours old), removal by moderators after hitting front page, disappearing comments and users kidnapped by masked ICE agents / NSA / FBI orders against the Reddit owners in cahoots with Elon Musk. The casino timeless Epstein frenzy of flocking to the information strip tease performance. The media addiction of Fox News audience, Musk Twitter audience, Reddit audience is not discussed. Just the mind-blowing consumption of status symbols / icons / Trump branding and logo / images of a man they hate so much but love the stimulation of another round of perpetual mocking at Trump / MAGA.

MAGA blows the Reddit and Bluesky Pluribus minds out again with paradox from the dead man. People will not study media ecology of podcast entertainer Charlie Kirk and Niki Minaj lead by Reality TV Trump superstar. Neil Postman spins in his grave, Charlie Kirk keeps exploiting Reddit audience hive minded mockery chamber. Avoiding nonfiction of McLuhan / Postman. Surkov won, unstoppable runaway monomyth.

Front page of Reddit before Christmas. Reality TV, just like Donald Trump. Entertainment television that MAGA men consume. Reality Reddit / Reality Truth Social / Reality Facebook / Reality Twitter. No-identity Twitter accounts from other nations promoting USA / MAGA this year before Thanksgiving. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/us/politics/x-twitter-location-maga-controversy.html - Yet Reddit audience avoids nonfiction learning of "Media Ecology" from Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman. MAGA constantly insults "lib-tards", blames "the liberals", "liberal tears", calls other nations dumb stupid idiots. Yet that is all Reddit audience does with MAGA since June 16, 2015. Mocking and insulting *cringe* and "leopards ate faces" is feedback loops of constant mocking and insulting.  There is no serious discussion of "Internet Research Agency" anywhere, people see Putin and Trump together in Alaska - and mock and move on to amusement as usual about sports, car racing, steam video game sales, PC RAM hardware prices, junk media addictions. People are more engaged mocking the reality of { Erika Kirk / Charlie Kirk / Elon Musk / Truth Social } media addiction behaviors of Reality TV dating and relationships lading men in USA than actually educating and teaching how serious this problem is and that it has wrecked the USA with a cult of nonsense. Attraction to fiction storytelling leaders like Erika Kirk. It's Christmas, miracle magical birth from outer space father, Santa Claus, nobody wants to face that "Reality TV" leaders are Saudi Arabian royalty / Mecca science fiction stories.

When everything is Reality TV entertainment and leaders of stardom, you can grab women, grab immigrants, grab nations, grab Ukraine, grab whatever you want and script your own screenplay. Reddit society mocks back at tree after tree and will not study non-fiction Vlad Surkov forest since year 2007. And stay *focused* and repeat focus on Surkov and educate people who media addiction of star power has taken over USA society / White House. Mocking Elon Musk for purchasing Twitter was avoiding the power of social media to take over the USA.

Front page of Reddit approaching Christmas / Jesus birthday parties. This is the very mechanism of power for Putin and Trump. [Putin just came out this week saying child sex marriages were long-standing tradition](/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md#putin-confirms-december-2025) (like Christmas rituals traditions). Trump hosts teenage sex media events. This is what attracts loyalty awake audiences. This media content behavior is why Donald Trump has more power than anyone in world history for over a full decade. His legendary sex life that audiences want, celebrity sex tapes of discussing play by play of his conquest of babies and children. Look at the [year 2012 timeline of what draws an audience on little girls being sexually targeted](/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md) and abused with media consumers / popular audience attraction and engagement. Trump is the World Wide Web content leader of global attraction to little girl predatory action for hours of hours per day of touch device audiences.

Front page of Reddit. Funny-washing comedy-washing Epstein document topics. Isn't it funny as hell to joke and meme about all the entertainment Putin / Epstein provide leading around male leaders like Trump! How young girls are depicted in this Reddit image and how young girls are abused by old powerful white men like Epstein and Putin to lead the Reddit audience of meme addicts. So funny, so amusing, the great comedy that Surkov students provide to Reddit audiences!

I don't think people grasp the questions being asked "what is going on", mindsets that are self-harm. People won't take media ecology and information warfare topics seriously. Fox News influence used to be remarked about in 2015 and 2016, Jen Seko's nonfiction film came out those years. But now people just accept as normal the Fox News fiction addictions. You have a headline of "wake up", but people don't even understand what that means. It means wake up from fiction addiction. Christmas just happened, the Bible is fiction. Fox News is fiction. Truth Social is fiction. People are not facing up to real reality and the problems of ego-driven choice-driven media consumption filter bubbles. Fiction vs. fiction conflicts.
