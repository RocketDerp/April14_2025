"It wonâ€™t change until we riot in the streets. Euro style. You want attention you gain it. One person complaining is a complainer. Everyone complaining is a problem."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : MAGA changed society without rioting in the streets. Middle East has violence and terrorism in the streets for thousands of years as each gorup of fiction mythology storytelling addicts consumes different interpretations of events and attacks the gentiles, non-believers, infidels. USA has let QAnon and MAGA adopt fiction news (Fox News, Newsmax, QAnon, memes, junk social media, clickbait fantasy). Donald Trump thrives off the idea that science is bad. That reason thinking is bad. And that poorly thought out actions are good, like riotsin the street (mindless action is not educatiion and teaching). People are likely going to die in USA saving the Pizzagate QAnon childern from the QAnon fantasy ideas and Donald Trump fantasy fiction. Think real hard about the role Fox News has played in educating adults, in the role Reddit and Bluesky and Twitter an Facebook has played in educating adults. Riots are a step away from education and teaching, anti-progress. One-line Twitter-thinking is Donald Trump's power,and this Reddit comment (popular upvoted) is the source of the problems of MAGA. Anti-education, anti-comprehension, anti-learning. ===:::
