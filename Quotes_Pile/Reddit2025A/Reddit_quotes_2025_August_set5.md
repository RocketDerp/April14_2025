tRump, a career criminal and aspiring global dictator invited another criminal and dictator for afternoon tea because tRump wants to learn “dictator 101” from putzky. That’s why tRump is also so infatuated with xi and kim. He wants to be in the dictator club real bad.

The only time tRump expends effort or time into something is if he can gain something from it. The funny, or sad, thing is that tRump thinks himself clever enough to pull something over on vladdy.

I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that **creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment**, that is the inevitable result."  ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business ===:::

"I feel like the problem goes deeper. Palestinian statehood and self-determination have been denied for 70 years. Blaming Netanyahu absolves Israel—and everyday Israelis—of complicity in the ethnic cleansing, and denial of human rights that occurs there.

It's like blaming Trump for America being a global bully. it's always been a global bully, Trump is just mask off. Israel's always been about ethnic cleasning, Bib is just the mask off version.

When Golda Meir said "there's no such thing as a Palestinian", have Israelis taken down streets in her honor? Is her name treated with the same disdain as those who tried to erase other ethnicities. Israel is a country that has plazas and streets named after Mehachem Begin—still, in 2025—and monuments to Olei Hagardom, terrorists."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : These kind of statements are living in Denial. Donald Trump's egomania has been incredibly popular and people have adopted him as a role model. Egoism has never been more popular in USA. Donald Trump's image is not built around untouchable. "he built his entire image around being powerful and untouchable" is shallow and wrong. Donald Trump has built his image on being *popular*, more popular than popular. Entertainment. Amusement. What Neil Postman writes about in Manhattan in year 1985. Rick Roderick, Duke Unviersity 1993: ["The simulation has outrun the so-called reality. That concept in Baudrillard he calls the “hyperreal”. Hyperreality is more real than real. This is… it actually sounds… if some of this sounds like advertising slogans: good. Because in Baudrillard the heritage of philosophy and social theory has passed over into advertising and television. So if it sounds superficial: good, because the theory, the world that he looks at has become superficial and banal. If it sounds hokey like a salesman’s pitch: good. The world he describes is the world of Jurassic Park, not of Dante. So that is all evidence on the side of Baudrillard if you follow the argument deep enough and with enough clarity. Okay let me explain the hyperreality; this is an important concept in Baudrillard. In Baudrillard, ah, we have already said that reality is simply that which could be simulated. Can’t be simulated: not real. But more real than real is a reality"](https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/) - Donald Trump has built his life of year 2013 onward to behave like Kremlin Russian Surkov techniques.

"It should be abundantly clear to anyone by now that Republicans idea of strength is an openly fascist dictator. So to them he is a strong leader, because he's fine with openly abducting people off the street and ignoring judges orders."

"
> The greatest irony of it all? This is actually the "deep state" at work and all those geniuses who've been saying "question everything" and "buttery males" are totally on board. What a twist!

That is the point behind Dale Gribble in King of the Hill. He sees conspiracies in everything, but cannot see the one right in front of his face."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “Conspiracy theories have long been used to maintain power: the Soviet leadership saw capitalist and counter-revolutionary conspiracies everywhere; the Nazis, Jewish ones. But those conspiracies were ultimately there to buttress an ideology, whether class warfare for Communists or race for Nazis. With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology – indeed, which can’t if they want to maintain power by **sending different messages to different people** – the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the world view itself. Conspiracy does not support the ideology; it replaces it. In Russia this is captured in the catchphrase of the country’s most important current affairs presenter: ‘A coincidence? I don’t think so!’ says Dmitry Kiselev as he twirls between tall tales that dip into history, literature, oil prices and colour revolutions, which all return to the theme of how the world has it in for Russia. And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, **one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism** about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a **renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’**. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.'” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

"They never cared about the children, that's why they kept calling everyone a pedo - which is something whose only effect is making people no longer care about hearing that accusation."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes. Pizzagate / QAnon burned out these words to normalize them. That's how Kremlin information warfare works since March 2013. Further, this is why I constantly emphasize the timeline of Malala from Pakistan's rise to public with her book from October 8, 2013 - which is a month before Donald Trump's Moscow sex show in November 2013. If people actually care about the topic of protecting girls from predatory abuse by elders, then Malala covers that topic on a global scale and is ASKING people to join with her as a global reformation. EMPHASIS on DATE of publication: July 10, 2019. Way before Donald Trump second term and "Epstein List" chanting all over Bluesky and Reddit. ["The Epstein Scandal Is Giving QAnon Everything Pizzagate Couldn’t"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-epstein-scandal-is-giving-qanon-everything-pizzagate-couldnt/) - the HIGH road is to **name drop Malala from Pakistan, over and over** - you can do that ALONG WITH saying "Epstein List" - but people don't take the high road, no matter how easy it is to use social media. Making Malala famous makes the Taliban Pakistan behavior compared to MAGA marriage to children behavior a global topic, a World Wide Web coverage of the topic. Mix in Iran and Palestine and MAGA as all Levant *conservative values*. In year 1775, life expectancy was WAY LOWER and perhaps marriage at age 15 made sense. But in year 2025 life expectancy is 75 years and we have over 8 billion people crammed on Earth fighting over greed and resources. ===:::

"Ask them to define “liberal, “left,” and “Democrat.” Throw in “progressive” for shits and giggles. Should be good for a laugh."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This does not really deal with the USA Christian problems, Donald Trump $59.99 Bible fanatics. Ask them to study "1 John 3:17" and explain how it applies to Donald Trump and Elon Musk - and if Karl Marx from Germany invited the ideas expressed in Levant Bible 2,000 years ago of loving your enemy and sharing food and housing with the poor. Democracy will not work if people believe *hate thy neighbor, hate thy enemy* - and we need to face up that democracy government requires love and compassion for your fellow man. It isn't optional. Starving your fellow man so you can have $8 billion dollars more a year for your own self is a monster state. Like Russia run by Putin the past 25 years. The word the Bible uses in "1 John 3:17" for Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk and Donald Trump? **"Liar"** is what The Bible tells you to call these people in an audit statement, judgment statement. Yes, The Bible does tell you to judge people, that's the purpose of "1 John 3:17". The Bible is full of contradictory confusing poetry, and if We The People can't find "1 John 3:17" and apply it to Donald Trump... and all people can find is hate messages in The Bible - then we are doomed as a society. We can't even read a 2,000 year old storybook correctly! What hope do we have with the latest film, song lyrics, or video games when we can't even read The dusty old Bible correctly and [apply Matthew 6:5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church) and "1 John 3:17" to Donald Trump? ===:::
