I keep seeing this guy's tweet on Reddit, but is he getting any attention offline or in real life?

"The attention is real and ironically right wing media talking heads are going on about how immature he sounds without acknowledging that he is simply mocking and mimicking their king."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : In other words, the answer to Fox News is not for every other media outlet to adopt Fox News fiction content. Except that is what happens because fiction outsells nonfiction. Antics politics and entertainment society has taken over the audience, this has been going on since March 2013 when the IRA went online. Playing into a Russian information warfare meme system is a terrible idea. ChatGPT / GrokAI and other large language models (LLM) have been trained on Kremlin information warfare and are [regurgitating the same Cambridge Analytica and Russian mind-fucking 5,000 patterns](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446) in new variations.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Americans are in extreme denial of how long they have been living under social media Donald Trump values, how long Fox News entertainment HDTV values have influenced all other news networks. The denial that fiction outsells nonfiction. People are looking into amusement funhouse mirrors, not in any way moving towards scientific sincere reality. Neil Postman 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is the mirror that shows the problem a decade before Fox News wnet online October 7, 1996 and before MAGA Trumpism took off. 1985 was when Ronald Regan entertainment POTUS was second term. ===:::

"Finally someone has the balls to play trumps stupid game. If only all the dems have the same balls."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit active measures, mind-fucking the audience of Reddit. Twitter-length Tweet-thinking that the answer to *stupid* is be *more stupid*, dumb and dumber. Addicts to stupid fiction content of Reddit social machines want even more content to feed their addiction to memes and trash. “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding (1995) of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, [the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie **Dumb and Dumber**. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

"Yes, Trump is envious of Gavin. Trump is envious of anyone who shows competency in any field. Because competency is something Trump has failed to personally demonstrate his entire life. This is one of the reasons he surrounds himself with ass- kissers and incompetent people."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It is really sad and sickening to see such extreme psychological denial among Americans about Donald Trump. He is amazingly accomplished at filling every media network of every size and type with his brand family name and entertaining people to such extremes that they give up power and wealth. Donald Trump commands all Reddit users into hate and mocking and nobody resists with intellect and science thinking. People are deeply in love with Donald Trump content, it gives their life purpose to mock and hate. Donald Trump has wrecked lives, wrecked future, to serve Putin and Surkov media addictions, antics politics. USA is not about Donald Trump, one person, and [We The People have sold out the entire nation 100% of the nation - to media addiction](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/). And Donald Trump is the Trickle Down Content dealer, the provider, of the memes people love more than life itself. A nation is not about what ONE MAN wants, it is about what 300 million people choose EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY - their addiction to Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton act. Thinking this is about one man alone, **Donald Trump's personal envy** and his *personal dementia* completely avoids the elephants in the room: Fox News, Elon Musk Twitter, Newsmax, /r/Conservative subreddit, the trash all over Reddit front page of junk memes, Rupert Murdoch's entire empire of fiction, hundreds of millions of [Americans who admire and desire Putin's 25 years of power and Russian media systems](https://youtu.be/5Au332OG-M4?t=420). ===:::

" "sad" is my absolute favorite part"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Meme addicts cheer on the bamboozle, compulsive attraction to Trumpism. People in USA society absolutely adore being mind-fucked by the Kremlin and White House using Surkov techniques. People can not get ENOUGH of mocking and insulting the bullshit that comes out of Donald Trump. It's been TEN FULL YEARS of people mimicking and adopting Donald Trump's style / manners / thinking. People adopt the Trump mindsets and flock to his output shit, it is irresistible to meme consumers. The meme addicts of America have polluted and trashed the USA Mass Mind / Mass Man thinking systems by copycat behavior of Donald Trump. It is sickening and sad that you can never escape the addiction people have to the Tony Clifton performance. Donald Trump knows the more unusual and odd he behaves in interaction with the press systems / media systems of society. [The medium is the massage, March 1967, is essential understanding](https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/) to all this power and wealth concentration that the Kremlin has done with Putin for 25 years and why Donald Trump exploits the audience (paired with IRA bottom-up audience mind-fucking). ::: :: :::
“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995 ===:::

"I like that it's actually the same sort of petty bullshit that Trump engages in."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit media addicts to trash garbage media desire and crave more trash thinking and meme systems. This compulsive addiction to Kremlin Surkov governing methods is not only on Reddit, it is on Bluesky and Twitter and TikTok and YouTube comment sections, etc, etc, etc. Clickbait trash White House content and South Park are unified exploitation of Surkov information war outcomes. This is feasting upon the information warfare mind-fucked population. Science reason thinking and intelligence is repulsed by the meme-thinking chucklehead society. Exactly as Neil Postman described in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about electric media ecology. Sexual orgy of John 1:1 mind-fucking media consumers. John 1:1 - God is memes and only memes, God is language and only language. A mind virus (Elon Musk Term) that is Trumpism.
Petty bullshit dragging down everyone, this is a media ecology crisis, and comprehensive understand of Neil Postman's 1985 book (and 1992 book, and September 1995 book, and Carl Sagan's 1995 book) puts this into perspective. This is what Carl Sagan called "celebration of ignorance" in 1995. Carl Sagan even went out of his way to emphasize the Twitter-length thinking, 10 second media content, of this Reddit reply message in 1995. [Rick Roderick, Duke University, in 1993 emphasized "are just reduced to banality, just the common rubble of little one line joke, you follow me?"](https://rickroderick.org/304-marcuse-and-one-dimensional-man-1993/) - emphasize on LITTLE ONE-LINE, Twitter-length comments like this Reddit one and Carl Sagan *10-seconds in length*. It is a mindset of jamming out comprehension with amusement / humor / joke mindsets, and Surkov Kremlin information warfare induces these mindsets not only in Donald Trump, but the entire USA population. Everything becomes scripted and improvised Reality TV antics. Tony Clifton act. Not just Trump behaving like Tony Clifton, but everyone (peer pressure built bottom-up by Kremlin since March 2013 with IRA) adopting in copycat / thinking they are out-sarcasm the Surkov technique. It drags everyone down in a *race to the bottom* of the human subconsious mindsets. ===:::

So unless someone somewhere leaks original copies I think it's fair to just assume the worst: that everyone with any kind of power is in them. Every billionaire, every high ranking politician, every complicit Republican and Democrat that's currently letting him steamroll our Constitution for the fashy oligarchy. The whole "that's nice, release the files" thing is starting to feel like it was intentional to distract us from the big issues."

It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that **creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment**, that is the inevitable result."  ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business ===:::

"I feel like the problem goes deeper. Palestinian statehood and self-determination have been denied for 70 years. Blaming Netanyahu absolves Israel—and everyday Israelis—of complicity in the ethnic cleansing, and denial of human rights that occurs there.

It's like blaming Trump for America being a global bully. it's always been a global bully, Trump is just mask off. Israel's always been about ethnic cleasning, Bib is just the mask off version.

When Golda Meir said "there's no such thing as a Palestinian", have Israelis taken down streets in her honor? Is her name treated with the same disdain as those who tried to erase other ethnicities. Israel is a country that has plazas and streets named after Mehachem Begin—still, in 2025—and monuments to Olei Hagardom, terrorists."

Egoism has never been more popular in USA. Donald Trump's image is not built around untouchable. "he built his entire image around being powerful and untouchable" is shallow and wrong. Donald Trump has built his image on being *popular*, more popular than popular. Entertainment. Amusement. What Neil Postman writes about in Manhattan in year 1985. Rick Roderick, Duke Unviersity 1993: ["The simulation has outrun the so-called reality. That concept in Baudrillard he calls the “hyperreal”. Hyperreality is more real than real. This is… it actually sounds… if some of this sounds like advertising slogans: good. Because in Baudrillard the heritage of philosophy and social theory has passed over into advertising and television. So if it sounds superficial: good, because the theory, the world that he looks at has become superficial and banal. If it sounds hokey like a salesman’s pitch: good. The world he describes is the world of Jurassic Park, not of Dante. So that is all evidence on the side of Baudrillard if you follow the argument deep enough and with enough clarity. Okay let me explain the hyperreality; this is an important concept in Baudrillard. In Baudrillard, ah, we have already said that reality is simply that which could be simulated. Can’t be simulated: not real. But more real than real is a reality"](https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/) - Donald Trump has built his life of year 2013 onward to behave like Kremlin Russian Surkov techniques.

"
> The greatest irony of it all? This is actually the "deep state" at work and all those geniuses who've been saying "question everything" and "buttery males" are totally on board. What a twist!

That is the point behind Dale Gribble in King of the Hill. He sees conspiracies in everything, but cannot see the one right in front of his face."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “Conspiracy theories have long been used to maintain power: the Soviet leadership saw capitalist and counter-revolutionary conspiracies everywhere; the Nazis, Jewish ones. But those conspiracies were ultimately there to buttress an ideology, whether class warfare for Communists or race for Nazis. With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology – indeed, which can’t if they want to maintain power by **sending different messages to different people** – the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the world view itself. Conspiracy does not support the ideology; it replaces it. In Russia this is captured in the catchphrase of the country’s most important current affairs presenter: ‘A coincidence? I don’t think so!’ says Dmitry Kiselev as he twirls between tall tales that dip into history, literature, oil prices and colour revolutions, which all return to the theme of how the world has it in for Russia. And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, **one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism** about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a **renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’**. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.'” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes. Pizzagate / QAnon burned out these words to normalize them. That's how Kremlin information warfare works since March 2013. Further, this is why I constantly emphasize the timeline of Malala from Pakistan's rise to public with her book from October 8, 2013 - which is a month before Donald Trump's Moscow sex show in November 2013. If people actually care about the topic of protecting girls from predatory abuse by elders, then Malala covers that topic on a global scale and is ASKING people to join with her as a global reformation. EMPHASIS on DATE of publication: July 10, 2019. Way before Donald Trump second term and "Epstein List" chanting all over Bluesky and Reddit. ["The Epstein Scandal Is Giving QAnon Everything Pizzagate Couldn’t"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-epstein-scandal-is-giving-qanon-everything-pizzagate-couldnt/) - the HIGH road is to **name drop Malala from Pakistan, over and over** - you can do that ALONG WITH saying "Epstein List" - but people don't take the high road, no matter how easy it is to use social media. Making Malala famous makes the Taliban Pakistan behavior compared to MAGA marriage to children behavior a global topic, a World Wide Web coverage of the topic. Mix in Iran and Palestine and MAGA as all Levant *conservative values*. In year 1775, life expectancy was WAY LOWER and perhaps marriage at age 15 made sense.

"A few years ago I would have called this absolutely unprofessional. However, few people have the power and noterioty to call Trump out in an impactful way. After trying to play nice, it's time to take off the gloves. Although not previously a Newsom fan, I'm now very supportive of Newsom stopping the bully. He's trying to do something when our other leaders have shown cowardice. Right now, we need the Newsoms, the Trey Parkers and Matt Stones, to push the buttons that have long let things slide. Enough is enough. Troll away!

(I do wish others like Borat and Triumph would join them)"

Remember Trump supporters, wealth inequality in Russia is much worse than the US. The top 1% own 56% of all wealth in Russia vs 26% in the US. If you think you're going to benefit under a Trump-o-Russian regime, I've got a bridge to sell you."
