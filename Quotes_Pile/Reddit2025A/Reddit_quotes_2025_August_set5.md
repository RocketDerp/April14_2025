"Biff won more than the movie's wildest dreams. We live in a timeline so extreme it would've been laughed out of a movie theater for being unrealistic.

Our Biff is the president of the US, is friendly with nations like Russia, is enacting the same trade policy that contributed to the great recession, is destroying all US relationships, including with Canada of all countries, and is actively destroying rule of law sending the country to a path akin to Nazi Germany.

Trump is the Biff who graduated from casinos with an admiration and aspiration for Adolf Hitler."

"Why do you think the US even gets a say in it? Putin seems perfectly capable of playing Trump like a fiddle, he doesn't need to offer up anything.

This entire thing is so disgusting, yet inevitable. It's almost incredible to watch, if it weren't so tragic. Makes me wonder who the next monster in line is going to be after the orange warcriminal stops breathing"

"Worse, is that Putin aims to tie America up in economic agreements. That way, when he invades Europe, America will stay out of it.

Putin is hoping to get American business into Russia as well, to make it more difficult for Ukraine and allies to strike him without getting America on our backs about it.

He's a clever guy, not always successful, but can run rings round certain individuals.

We should have done more, earlier and at lower cost (as always)"

Yes, of course he will. It doesn't matter if they are a "super power" (they aren't), but if Europe and the US refuse to fight, he can basically do whatever he wants.

Europe and the US gave up without putting a single boot on the ground."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Simplistic Twitter-length thinking. "The media" includes Quran Mosque, Church Bible, Syngagouge Torah, Fox News HDTV, Reddit itself is media, Facebook, Bluesky - this person thinks that humanity of over 8 billion people isn't "delusional" when it comes to media ecology. That the problem is ONLY on Reddit in front of their face. Donald Trump has been the focus of EVERY DAY ALL DAY of USA life for over 10 years now, like God / Jesus, people can't get enough of Donald Trump mocking and insulting. Look at the way people decorate their houses and cars / pickup trucks / clothing with Doanld Trump status symbols and icons... that has been going on since year 2015. It isn't just "the media" and "Redditor" users. Study Swat Valley Pakistan and Radio Mullah from Malala's book. Study domestic Russia media systems and how people behave towards reality itself under Surkov and Putin for the past 25 years. Humanity has a crisis with addiction to fiction, globally. ===:::

"It's not brazen, he got the go ahead from the president of the usa. Every US citizen is now putins bitch, not just trump. The whole country got sold out. And until someone actually drags that fascist government to the gallows the entire nation will continue to be a threat to the rest of the world."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "drags that fascist government to the gallows" does not fix a war against reality. The pro-measles, anti-science, addiction to fiction, Fox News HDTV, Facebook / Reddit / Bluesky media ecology ignorance doesn't get solved with murder. Addiction to insult and mocking Donald Trump is super big cult level. That continues even when cult leaders are dead, Scientology media still works on people even with death of L Ron Hubbard. Even with death of Jesus, people are still driven by the fiction storytelling in The Bible to wreck Earth and believe in Heven magic after death. If peole in USA don't actually "love one another" while alive here on Earth, and hate and mocking and insulting Donald Trump is the core faith and desire, the outcomes of hate will rule. Regardless of which people are leading the nation. Woodstock 1969 teaching and sharing of Love / Peace / Compassion values, the hippies,, sustained the USA from wrecking the world even worse - but all that 1960's education has been abandoned for faith in machine lust hate and insulting and mocking Donald Trump. ===:::

"That was actually part of the con itself. That wasn't ironic, it was purposely put forward in a calculated way so that when the Trump regime then actually went ahead and *did* rig the 2024 election results (via Musk and likely Thiel too) it would be political suicide for ANYONE on the left to question the integrity of the election itself.

Doesn't anyone else see this..?

They cried wolf so much that it became so unpalatable for Democrats to do the same, lest they are seen as pure hypocrites. It was a very very smart tactic, and I can only fucking hope that the truth comes out soon.

Addicts to stupid fiction content of Reddit social machines want even more content to feed their addiction to memes and trash. “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding (1995) of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, [the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie **Dumb and Dumber**. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

This compulsive addiction to Kremlin Surkov governing methods is not only on Reddit, it is on Bluesky and Twitter and TikTok and YouTube comment sections, etc, etc, etc. Clickbait trash White House content and South Park are unified exploitation of Surkov information war outcomes. This is feasting upon the information warfare mind-fucked population. Science reason thinking and intelligence is repulsed by the meme-thinking chucklehead society.

Petty bullshit dragging down everyone, this is a media ecology crisis, and comprehensive understand of Neil Postman's 1985 book (and 1992 book, and September 1995 book, and Carl Sagan's 1995 book) puts this into perspective. This is what Carl Sagan called "celebration of ignorance" in 1995.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that **creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment**, that is the inevitable result."  ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business ===:::

"I feel like the problem goes deeper. Palestinian statehood and self-determination have been denied for 70 years. Blaming Netanyahu absolves Israel—and everyday Israelis—of complicity in the ethnic cleansing, and denial of human rights that occurs there.

It's like blaming Trump for America being a global bully. it's always been a global bully, Trump is just mask off. Israel's always been about ethnic cleasning, Bib is just the mask off version.

When Golda Meir said "there's no such thing as a Palestinian", have Israelis taken down streets in her honor? Is her name treated with the same disdain as those who tried to erase other ethnicities. Israel is a country that has plazas and streets named after Mehachem Begin—still, in 2025—and monuments to Olei Hagardom, terrorists."

Egoism has never been more popular in USA. Donald Trump's image is not built around untouchable. "he built his entire image around being powerful and untouchable" is shallow and wrong. Donald Trump has built his image on being *popular*, more popular than popular. Entertainment. Amusement. What Neil Postman writes about in Manhattan in year 1985. Rick Roderick, Duke Unviersity 1993: ["The simulation has outrun the so-called reality. That concept in Baudrillard he calls the “hyperreal”. Hyperreality is more real than real. This is… it actually sounds… if some of this sounds like advertising slogans: good. Because in Baudrillard the heritage of philosophy and social theory has passed over into advertising and television. So if it sounds superficial: good, because the theory, the world that he looks at has become superficial and banal. If it sounds hokey like a salesman’s pitch: good. The world he describes is the world of Jurassic Park, not of Dante. So that is all evidence on the side of Baudrillard if you follow the argument deep enough and with enough clarity. Okay let me explain the hyperreality; this is an important concept in Baudrillard. In Baudrillard, ah, we have already said that reality is simply that which could be simulated. Can’t be simulated: not real. But more real than real is a reality"](https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/) - Donald Trump has built his life of year 2013 onward to behave like Kremlin Russian Surkov techniques.

"
> The greatest irony of it all? This is actually the "deep state" at work and all those geniuses who've been saying "question everything" and "buttery males" are totally on board. What a twist!

That is the point behind Dale Gribble in King of the Hill. He sees conspiracies in everything, but cannot see the one right in front of his face."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “Conspiracy theories have long been used to maintain power: the Soviet leadership saw capitalist and counter-revolutionary conspiracies everywhere; the Nazis, Jewish ones. But those conspiracies were ultimately there to buttress an ideology, whether class warfare for Communists or race for Nazis. With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology – indeed, which can’t if they want to maintain power by **sending different messages to different people** – the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the world view itself. Conspiracy does not support the ideology; it replaces it. In Russia this is captured in the catchphrase of the country’s most important current affairs presenter: ‘A coincidence? I don’t think so!’ says Dmitry Kiselev as he twirls between tall tales that dip into history, literature, oil prices and colour revolutions, which all return to the theme of how the world has it in for Russia. And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, **one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism** about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a **renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’**. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.'” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes. Pizzagate / QAnon burned out these words to normalize them. That's how Kremlin information warfare works since March 2013. Further, this is why I constantly emphasize the timeline of Malala from Pakistan's rise to public with her book from October 8, 2013 - which is a month before Donald Trump's Moscow sex show in November 2013. If people actually care about the topic of protecting girls from predatory abuse by elders, then Malala covers that topic on a global scale and is ASKING people to join with her as a global reformation. EMPHASIS on DATE of publication: July 10, 2019. Way before Donald Trump second term and "Epstein List" chanting all over Bluesky and Reddit. ["The Epstein Scandal Is Giving QAnon Everything Pizzagate Couldn’t"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-epstein-scandal-is-giving-qanon-everything-pizzagate-couldnt/) - the HIGH road is to **name drop Malala from Pakistan, over and over** - you can do that ALONG WITH saying "Epstein List" - but people don't take the high road, no matter how easy it is to use social media. Making Malala famous makes the Taliban Pakistan behavior compared to MAGA marriage to children behavior a global topic, a World Wide Web coverage of the topic. Mix in Iran and Palestine and MAGA as all Levant *conservative values*. In year 1775, life expectancy was WAY LOWER and perhaps marriage at age 15 made sense.

"A few years ago I would have called this absolutely unprofessional. However, few people have the power and noterioty to call Trump out in an impactful way. After trying to play nice, it's time to take off the gloves. Although not previously a Newsom fan, I'm now very supportive of Newsom stopping the bully. He's trying to do something when our other leaders have shown cowardice. Right now, we need the Newsoms, the Trey Parkers and Matt Stones, to push the buttons that have long let things slide. Enough is enough. Troll away!

(I do wish others like Borat and Triumph would join them)"

Nobody cares to understand WHY Donald Trump Truth Social / Twitter works so well, the side-effects, just that it works. The entire MAGA problem. ===:::

"Some of the comments here remind me of people who were oblivious to Colbert when he was on Comedy Central. Over their heads.

People that are saying "be above this" or "play fair". You do realize that we have an Administration that is suspending due process, ignoring the Constitution, violating the Posse Comitatus Act and destroying the economy by passing tariffs (which Congress are the ones who are supposed to do this)?

And be above this is all you got?"

"Sounds like Trump got more pointers from Putin. 

Remember Trump supporters, wealth inequality in Russia is much worse than the US. The top 1% own 56% of all wealth in Russia vs 26% in the US. If you think you're going to benefit under a Trump-o-Russian regime, I've got a bridge to sell you."

"To be fair, managing to destroy democracy and replace it with neoliberal authoritarianism, capitulating to dictators while simultaneously attacking allies, stealing money from the poor at a time when wealth inequality is at an all time high, committing heinous, unconstitutional acts of racism not seen since WWII, having a close friendship with the most prolific sex trafficker in history and still somehow managing be a sitting president is a hell of an accomplishment.

Not a great one that he or anyone should ever be proud of, but still an accomplishment."

In 1937 Germany, they did not have Unicode messages and "block button", they had to burn magazines and books with flame on paper. Cult deprogramming is essential. We need to rescue domestic Russia too. These problem of addiciton to fiction and Kremlin informaiton warfare since March 2013 are DEEP. We haven't addressed Fox news cult and Twitter cult and hate-cults by just having some people flee. All systmes are bending towards hate. Love and compassion for strangers isn't optional, and nobody is teaching love lessons. ===:::

"I sometimes wonder if it’s because of social media too. When I was younger, the upperclassmen went to parties and drank and it was cool and mysterious. Then when I did, I had a blast, but someone, maybe even me, always did something embarrassing. They made for hilarious stories but god I’d hate for those moments to be encased on social media forever.
