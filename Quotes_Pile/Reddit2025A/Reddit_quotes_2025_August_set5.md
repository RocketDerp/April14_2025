"Kick is the platform with no rules for streamers other platforms ban. When Sneako and Johnny Somali are on that platform, you just know it's full of degenerate scum."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  It isn't just *rules*, there is an absence of moraltiy education and teaching of morals. People are attracted to Donald Trump, people flock to Donald Trump as a role model on the Internet since year 2013. Donald Trump at age 79 is like the Taliban elders Malala describes in her October 8, 2013 book about Swat Valley Pakistan. Nobody is teaching people good from bad and people are being programmed by billionares (Elon Musk anti-empathy) Donald Trump with massive media power to educate and teach morlity - to behave like Donald Trump, role model! Billionares are setting the social media society standard on Truth Social and Twitter and Fox News (Rupert Murdoch billionaire). The religion people aren't even teaching compassion and love at all, it's all obey and worship Donald Trump preaching / obey and worship Putin preaching. There is a massive education problem of people not following authentic morality reforms of Malala's book! Once MLK Jr was murdered, there really hasn't been someone reforming morality in USA at that scale. Bernie Sanders, yes, but he is in politics, and MLK Jr was outside that governing (military backed) power. Malala is outside military backed governing power in her reforms from Pakistan since January 2009 when she went online. As it stand today, the reality of the situation is Putin and Trump and Murdoch and Musk are teaching morality. People are in denial of this situation! Morality is learned, educated, and terrible values are being taught by billioanres to everyone (Musk / Putin / Trump / Murdoch). ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It is the kind of world lead by Musk, Putin, Trump, Murdoch billionares. Pay-per-view war against Ukraine, pay-per-view MAGA mass dehumanizaiton content. Because people find mocking and hate Donald Trump as hillarious amusing entertaining funny because Trump behaves absurd and surreal. Trump plays Tony Clifton and people pay to view it with media devices. Hate as faith is Donald Trump. Hate as religion is Donald Trump. People can not resist the hate messages and total mockery, Tony Clifton performance Trump does. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : He just met with Putin this week, how anyone can think with all the Russian mind-fuck. Donald Trump does an amazing job given the garbage junk memes he consumes from the Kremlin that cause extreme brain damage / executive function mental damage. Donald Trump is an addict to the Kremlin meme systems. Trump is like the *Neo* of the Kremlin Matrix of monomth fiction patterns. ===:::

"If any other sitting president tweeted "Bela" out of nowhere, we'd have a collective bipartisan shit, followed by the deployment of an entire regiment of mental health experts, both to the White House and as talking heads on on every news outlet on the planet.

Trump types multi-paragraph word salads on the daily, and we're all just like "eh, he's said weirder things." "

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users like Donald Trump can be measured and analyzied in who they are willing to quote. Media ecology. Which professional edited articles and texts do they post on social media to back up their claims. People are so obssed and worship Donald Trump's *original creative mythology content* that they don't even recognize that Trump should be quoting books from his lifetime. He is 79 years old, he hasn't read a book in 1985 he can quote? Stop criticizing Trump for his original langauge and words... focus on his influences. Tony Clifton character he plays.

It’s Crazier Than You Think." - January 2018](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/05/trump-media-feedback-loop-216248/) Donald Trump quotes and live-blogs Fox News.
“When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 ===:::

Then the DNC/campaign made him stop."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Astoundingly effective, ***at what***? Adding more bullshit to the Donald Trump and Putin bullshit? Diving into the ocean of Kremlin informaiton warfare since March 2013 and adding more shit to the anti-intelelctual total mockery Donald Trump shit-show?  Astoundingly effective at amusing a Reddit user who has never bothered to study Surkov governing in Russia year 2011, neer read book *Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia* fron year 2014 - and wants MORE Putin mind-fuck all the time. **You know what an alternative to saying "man, these guys are fucking weird" is?** Saying "We all need to read Neil Postman's 1985 book Amusing Ourselves To Death in describing what is going on with Donald Trump" and teaching cult depogramming to media addiction / Fox News media brainwashing (Jen Senko's March 2016 film release) DIRECTLY / HEAD ON with intelligence and learning (Neil Postman is an educator of educators). Donald Trump is a product of fast-food media addiction, junk content addiction, adding more trash sinks the USA further and further. Surkov won. ""I mean, Walz had them all absolutely frothing at the mouth" is exacgtly what Russia has of USA people since March 2013 IRA deployment. ""I mean, Walz had them all absolutely frothing at the mouth" is exactly what MAGA means with "liberal tears, cry more*. Americans hate Americans. Americans are **predatory feasting upon Americans who have been mind-fucked by Russia** since March 2013. ===:::

"Honestly, mimicking Dementia Donald right back at him is a highly effective way to demonstrate how weird and childish he is behaving. There's very little he can do to respond without acknowledging his own words, so it will be even more effective in person. As dumb as our time line really is lately, maybe this dumb thing is what it takes to shut down Dementia Donald's roll."

This has been gong on for OVER TEN FULL YEARS of non-stop mocking and insulting Donald Trump's performance of Tony Clifton from the social machine audience. " As dumb as our time line really is lately" - Reddit, August 19, 2025. So you want to add more and more dumb to the Russian information warfare since March 2013 and do nothing on social media to actually call out that this Tony Clifton behavior is Russian Kremlin Surkov methods. Psycologial denial that Surkov won the information war, INCLUSIVE of this Reddit user. "mimicking Dementia Donald" is EXACTLY what USA We The People have been DOING FOR OVER A DECADE NON-STOP EVREY HOUR OF EVERY DAY, THE ENTIRE NATION A TOTAL MOCKERY!!!!

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Time and time again you see these Twitter-length Tweet-think reaction comments on social media for OVER TEN YEARS. And you know what you do not see on social media comments? People saying: *let's all go to the public library and check out a book on* ***cult deprogramming*** *and start posting quotes and teachings from these books on our social media comments and postings!* Let's RESCUE the USA from the Kremlin information warfare! Let's address the Cambridge Analytica *aftermath* of fucked-up thinking patterns and cult behaviors. Instead, you just see people delcare it is a cult and not have any civic duty of resucing Americans from a lost Russian infomation war.

These people are literally delusional." - The Altantic article, [September 9, 2014: "At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. ***It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)  ===:::

"It's not blackmail. Trump is too stupid to blackmail. He'd almost certainly blurt out what he's being blackmailed for in an interview or something and render the blackmail useless.

The truth is even sadder. Trump admires Putin. Trump is a cheap bully and always has been. Like most bullies, he sees being violent and threatening as signs of strength and power. To him Putin really is the strongest leader in the world because people are scared of him and his actions. Putin hurts people for his own gain, basically as a daily action. Trump sees that as something to emulate.

Trump isn't bowing to Putin under duress. He's doing it out of honest admiration for his idol."

The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look.

"It goes way beyond this. For example, USAID was killed. How does that undermine science? Well, one of the things USAID did was buy vaccines for diseases prevalent "over there" to contain them before the came "over here" or led to geopolitical instability (think: al Quada-like groups). Money for those vaccines flowed back to basic research. Now, the big university immunology programs are dead because the money has been cut off. Years of longitudinal data have been lost. Research is set back a minimum of 20 years."

There has to be a MASSIVE wake up to woke Finnegans Wake level turnaround, every social media user admitting media addiction (Neil Postman was correct in year 1985 messaging). Blame the IRA, don't make this about Trump, make this about media ecology and everyone (age 12 to age 120) needing to learn Neil Postman's 1985 book of 184 pages. ANOTHER ISSUE: is Trump dies or is otherwise incpacitated, the USA population will not be seen as changing their mind, still anti-intellectual and arroange. Anyting short of a MASSIVE SUSTINED PEACEFUL UPRISING is not going to wash off the shitshow of addiction to Donald Trump antics (Social Media HALTING entertainment and teaching Neil Postman visibly IN PUBLIC as an admission of media addiction). ===:::

"Interestingly, it's how some people who consider themselves to be enlightened progressives will claim to be all about empathy, caring about the disenfranchised, and being morally correct....

But then they'll mock someone over their appearance, particularly doing something very anti-progressive like fat shaming. They'll make class-based jokes about them fucking couches on their front porches which really seems like a direct dig at poor white people (who are the people who have couches on front porches). Then they justify it because "well JD Vance is a bully, so it's okay"

It's pretty great hypocrisy really.

You're all about empathy and kindness but then when the chips are down and you don't like someone... well let's make fun of their appearance to discredit them. \*\*

"Biff won more than the movie's wildest dreams. We live in a timeline so extreme it would've been laughed out of a movie theater for being unrealistic.

Our Biff is the president of the US, is friendly with nations like Russia, is enacting the same trade policy that contributed to the great recession, is destroying all US relationships, including with Canada of all countries, and is actively destroying rule of law sending the country to a path akin to Nazi Germany.

Trump is the Biff who graduated from casinos with an admiration and aspiration for Adolf Hitler."

Putin is hoping to get American business into Russia as well, to make it more difficult for Ukraine and allies to strike him without getting America on our backs about it.

"I think the Epstein files are the real distraction. He's literally shaking the very core of what our democracy is built on and every time he does all we see is someone talking about the Epstein files. Yes. That is important, but what will that matter if he's surrounded himself with his own state police, owns the house and senate, and the supreme court. He's taken steps to own the media. Not to mention the cult who will follow him no matter what he does.

There are larger issues at stake here. I think people think that there will be this groundswell of people denouncing Trump if the files were released. When he controls all the political apparatus we put in place to curtail the presidents power, the Epstein files won't matter, because it would be too late to do anything about it."

"That was actually part of the con itself. That wasn't ironic, it was purposely put forward in a calculated way so that when the Trump regime then actually went ahead and *did* rig the 2024 election results (via Musk and likely Thiel too) it would be political suicide for ANYONE on the left to question the integrity of the election itself.

Doesn't anyone else see this..?

They cried wolf so much that it became so unpalatable for Democrats to do the same, lest they are seen as pure hypocrites. It was a very very smart tactic, and I can only fucking hope that the truth comes out soon. To what extent this truth may affect American democratic institutions, I just don't know, because nobody can really know yet. But it probably will not be good for the country nonetheless.

He brought up and used the Epstein files in order to distract people to get into office. Then he got in and threw them out because he doesn't need the distraction anymore. Now he can carry out his original plan - the fascist takeover of the US."

"You're spot on with this and it is incredibly frustrating to see the same "that's nice, release the files" responses repeatedly being thrown out for every horrible thing the admin says or does. It's really beginning to feel like the withholding of the files is the distraction. Yes, they should be released, but there's no way we could trust whatever this admin releases anyway. So unless someone somewhere leaks original copies I think it's fair to just assume the worst: that everyone with any kind of power is in them. Every billionaire, every high ranking politician, every complicit Republican and Democrat that's currently letting him steamroll our Constitution for the fashy oligarchy. The whole "that's nice, release the files" thing is starting to feel like it was intentional to distract us from the big issues."

"Yeah, I think it's a coping mechanism - I think a lot of Americans failed to see this shit coming, and are having a very hard time dealing with reality, so instead of addressing things that are actually happening and dealing with reality, they are deflecting to something "easier" that gives them some kind of misguided hope - "is somehow somewhere these files are magically released, maybe Trump will lose tons of support and the Democrats will be able to win in 2028". I think that's what's going through their heads, and it's sadly very much impossible, but also a very bad coping mechanism... and it's not remotely helping anyone with anything."

Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.

"I feel like the problem goes deeper. Palestinian statehood and self-determination have been denied for 70 years. Blaming Netanyahu absolves Israel—and everyday Israelis—of complicity in the ethnic cleansing, and denial of human rights that occurs there.

It's like blaming Trump for America being a global bully. it's always been a global bully, Trump is just mask off. Israel's always been about ethnic cleasning, Bib is just the mask off version.

When Golda Meir said "there's no such thing as a Palestinian", have Israelis taken down streets in her honor? Is her name treated with the same disdain as those who tried to erase other ethnicities. Israel is a country that has plazas and streets named after Mehachem Begin—still, in 2025—and monuments to Olei Hagardom, terrorists."

Donald Trump has built his image on being *popular*, more popular than popular. Entertainment. Amusement. What Neil Postman writes about in Manhattan in year 1985. Rick Roderick, Duke Unviersity 1993: ["The simulation has outrun the so-called reality. That concept in Baudrillard he calls the “hyperreal”. Hyperreality is more real than real. This is… it actually sounds… if some of this sounds like advertising slogans: good. Because in Baudrillard the heritage of philosophy and social theory has passed over into advertising and television. So if it sounds superficial: good, because the theory, the world that he looks at has become superficial and banal. If it sounds hokey like a salesman’s pitch: good. The world he describes is the world of Jurassic Park, not of Dante. So that is all evidence on the side of Baudrillard if you follow the argument deep enough and with enough clarity. Okay let me explain the hyperreality; this is an important concept in Baudrillard. In Baudrillard, ah, we have already said that reality is simply that which could be simulated. Can’t be simulated: not real.

"
> The greatest irony of it all? This is actually the "deep state" at work and all those geniuses who've been saying "question everything" and "buttery males" are totally on board. What a twist!

That is the point behind Dale Gribble in King of the Hill. He sees conspiracies in everything, but cannot see the one right in front of his face."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “Conspiracy theories have long been used to maintain power: the Soviet leadership saw capitalist and counter-revolutionary conspiracies everywhere; the Nazis, Jewish ones. But those conspiracies were ultimately there to buttress an ideology, whether class warfare for Communists or race for Nazis. With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology – indeed, which can’t if they want to maintain power by **sending different messages to different people** – the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the world view itself. Conspiracy does not support the ideology; it replaces it. In Russia this is captured in the catchphrase of the country’s most important current affairs presenter: ‘A coincidence? I don’t think so!’ says Dmitry Kiselev as he twirls between tall tales that dip into history, literature, oil prices and colour revolutions, which all return to the theme of how the world has it in for Russia. And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, **one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism** about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a **renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’**. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.'” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

If people actually care about the topic of protecting girls from predatory abuse by elders, then Malala covers that topic on a global scale and is ASKING people to join with her as a global reformation. EMPHASIS on DATE of publication: July 10, 2019. Way before Donald Trump second term and "Epstein List" chanting all over Bluesky and Reddit. ["The Epstein Scandal Is Giving QAnon Everything Pizzagate Couldn’t"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-epstein-scandal-is-giving-qanon-everything-pizzagate-couldnt/) - the HIGH road is to **name drop Malala from Pakistan, over and over** - you can do that ALONG WITH saying "Epstein List" - but people don't take the high road, no matter how easy it is to use social media. Making Malala famous makes the Taliban Pakistan behavior compared to MAGA marriage to children behavior a global topic, a World Wide Web coverage of the topic. Mix in Iran and Palestine and MAGA as all Levant *conservative values*. In year 1775, life expectancy was WAY LOWER and perhaps marriage at age 15 made sense. But in year 2025 life expectancy is 75 years and we have over 8 billion people crammed on Earth fighting over greed and resources. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This does not really deal with the USA Christian problems, Donald Trump $59.99 Bible fanatics. Ask them to study "1 John 3:17" and explain how it applies to Donald Trump and Elon Musk - and if Karl Marx from Germany invited the ideas expressed in Levant Bible 2,000 years ago of loving your enemy and sharing food and housing with the poor. Democracy will not work if people believe *hate thy neighbor, hate thy enemy* - and we need to face up that democracy government requires love and compassion for your fellow man. It isn't optional. Starving your fellow man so you can have $8 billion dollars more a year for your own self is a monster state. Like Russia run by Putin the past 25 years. The word the Bible uses in "1 John 3:17" for Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk and Donald Trump? **"Liar"** is what The Bible tells you to call these people in an audit statement, judgment statement. Yes, The Bible does tell you to judge people, that's the purpose of "1 John 3:17". The Bible is full of contradictory confusing poetry, and if We The People can't find "1 John 3:17" and apply it to Donald Trump... and all people can find is hate messages in The Bible - then we are doomed as a society. We can't even read a 2,000 year old storybook correctly! What hope do we have with the latest film, song lyrics, or video games when we can't even read The dusty old Bible correctly and [apply Matthew 6:5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church) and "1 John 3:17" to Donald Trump? ===:::
