"The double standard is glaring. They cry about being attacked while dishing out violence themselves. It's mind-boggling how they can't see the irony."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Glaring like Tony Clifton act on stage and Tony Clifton audience interaction. That's the whole point of Donald Trump / MAGA / Kremlin Surkov governing techniques. The [more glaring the contradictions](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), the more power and wealth are concentrated. ===:::

"What’s absolutely fucking crazy is all the people who’ve always had this mindset are now raging maga. It’s like their brains are wired to just be a piece of shit"

"It's ironic because this MAGA is PRETENDING to be offended that someone threw something at ICE. This is all performative means to an end. They told us who they were 5 years ago, and everything else is grift."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction and PRETENDING far outsells nonfiction. Donald Trump PRETENDING he is Tony Clifton character far outsells authhentic and sincere leaders. I don't consider MAGA ironic as much as exploiting irony addiction, irony poisoning, poisoning nonfiction with audience (We The Peoople) spectacle addiction. ===:::

"In keeping with where you are headed, I would love nothing more than to see the shittiest 1/3 of this country get tried and put away for 20+ years under RICO laws/statutes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Even before Donald Trump was elected to POTUS in November 2016 - USA society had such faith in prison systems that it is a neading society of "tried and put away" values. ["Comparison of United States incarceration rate with other countries"](Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries). This twitter-length Bluesky-length Twitter-thinking message on Reddit August 16, 2025 wants to build massive prison concentration camps for the poorly educated audience of Fox News and social media, saying "I would love nothing more than to see the shittiest 1/3 of this country get tried and put away" - the emphsis on the word *love*, how much this person thinks that love means putting political opponents "away" for decades. Reddit is mind-fucking peopel with these simplsitic ideas. ===:::

"J6 deniers might be the worst people in the country. J6 was the most filmed crime in the history of the world. The documentation of their crimes is mountainous and conclusive and they’re still gaslighting us about what the day was and why it happened. They can do it because they know the President agrees with their version of reality but facts are facts. Video doesn’t lie."

"Mr. President Trump, you stood there like a little white noodle, like a fanboy," - said Arnold Schwarzenegger about Trump's meeting with Putin.

"Every immigrant in this country is more American than the President. Immigrants are what make our country great. They always have been and always will be. We are a country founded on immigrants."

"Donald Dementia Dump was under the impression he was meeting Cotton Hill, who only killed 50 men."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction and insulting outsells nonfction. [Eating the Surkovian onions](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) on a Putin visit to Alaska. Simplstic reactionary to the Tony Clifton behaviors of Putin and Trump onn the world media stages, eating the Onion of the Tony Clifton acts. Surkov won, Russia won. Declaring from the audince to the media stage that "Tony Clifton is so dumb and bad and doesnt' realize he is terrible, Tony Clifton must have dementia" to the Trump/Putin duet performance. ===:::

"It does man, I sighed too. Even Ronald Reagan had the balls to stand up to Russia, make a demand. Meanwhile we know that Trump is just there making concessions, all to the detriment of the US Citizens and democracy."
