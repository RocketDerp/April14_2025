"Kick is the platform with no rules for streamers other platforms ban. When Sneako and Johnny Somali are on that platform, you just know it's full of degenerate scum."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  It isn't just *rules*, there is an absence of morality education and teaching of morals. People are attracted to Donald Trump, people flock to Donald Trump as a role model on the Internet since year 2013. Donald Trump at age 79 is like the Taliban elders Malala describes in her October 8, 2013 book about Swat Valley Pakistan. Nobody is teaching people good from bad and people are being programmed by billionaires (Elon Musk anti-empathy) Donald Trump with massive media power to educate and teach morality - to behave like Donald Trump, role model! Billionaires are setting the social media society standard on Truth Social and Twitter and Fox News (Rupert Murdoch billionaire). The religion people aren't even teaching compassion and love at all, it's all obey and worship Donald Trump preaching / obey and worship Putin preaching. There is a massive education problem of people not following authentic morality reforms of Malala's book! Once MLK Jr was murdered, there really hasn't been someone reforming morality in USA at that scale. Bernie Sanders, yes, but he is in politics, and MLK Jr was outside that governing (military backed) power. Malala is outside military backed governing power in her reforms from Pakistan since January 2009 when she went online. As it stand today, the reality of the situation is Putin and Trump and Murdoch and Musk are teaching morality. People are in denial of this situation! Morality is learned, educated, and terrible values are being taught by billioanres to everyone (Musk / Putin / Trump / Murdoch). ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It is the kind of world lead by Musk, Putin, Trump, Murdoch billionaires. Pay-per-view war against Ukraine, pay-per-view MAGA mass dehumanization content. Because people find mocking and hate Donald Trump as hilarious amusing entertaining funny because Trump behaves absurd and surreal. Trump plays Tony Clifton and people pay to view it with media devices. Hate as faith is Donald Trump. Hate as religion is Donald Trump. People can not resist the hate messages and total mockery, Tony Clifton performance Trump does. ===:::

"More like his handlers. You can tell a true trump rant by how weird/strange it is. Guessing he's finding it harder to even sorta-coherently text anymore. So someone got designated to post nonsense on his behalf."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : He just met with Putin this week, how anyone can think with all the Russian mind-fuck. Donald Trump does an amazing job given the garbage junk memes he consumes from the Kremlin that cause extreme brain damage / executive function mental damage. Donald Trump is an addict to the Kremlin meme systems. Trump is like the *Neo* of the Kremlin Matrix of monomth fiction patterns. ===:::

"If any other sitting president tweeted "Bela" out of nowhere, we'd have a collective bipartisan shit, followed by the deployment of an entire regiment of mental health experts, both to the White House and as talking heads on on every news outlet on the planet.

Trump types multi-paragraph word salads on the daily, and we're all just like "eh, he's said weirder things." "

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users like Donald Trump can be measured and analyzed in who they are willing to quote. Media ecology. Which professional edited articles and texts do they post on social media to back up their claims. People are so obsessed and worship Donald Trump's *original creative mythology content* that they don't even recognize that Trump should be quoting books from his lifetime. He is 79 years old, he hasn't read a book in 1985 he can quote? Stop criticizing Trump for his original language and words... focus on his influences. Tony Clifton character he plays.

It’s Crazier Than You Think." - January 2018](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/05/trump-media-feedback-loop-216248/) Donald Trump quotes and live-blogs Fox News.
“When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 ===:::

"I mean, Walz had them all absolutely frothing at the mouth with the "man, these guys are fucking weird" commentary. It was astoundingly effective.

Then the DNC/campaign made him stop."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Astoundingly effective, ***at what***? Adding more bullshit to the Donald Trump and Putin bullshit? Diving into the ocean of Kremlin information warfare since March 2013 and adding more shit to the anti-intellectual total mockery Donald Trump shit-show?  Astoundingly effective at amusing a Reddit user who has never bothered to study Surkov governing in Russia year 2011, never read book *Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia* from year 2014 - and wants MORE Putin mind-fuck all the time. **You know what an alternative to saying "man, these guys are fucking weird" is?** Saying "We all need to read Neil Postman's 1985 book Amusing Ourselves To Death in describing what is going on with Donald Trump" and teaching cult deprogramming to media addiction / Fox News media brainwashing (Jen Senko's March 2016 film release) DIRECTLY / HEAD ON with intelligence and learning (Neil Postman is an educator of educators). Donald Trump is a product of fast-food media addiction, junk content addiction, adding more trash sinks the USA further and further. Surkov won. ""I mean, Walz had them all absolutely frothing at the mouth" is exactly what Russia has of USA people since March 2013 IRA deployment. "I mean, Walz had them all absolutely frothing at the mouth" is exactly what MAGA means with "liberal tears, cry more*. Americans hate Americans. Americans are **predatory feasting upon Americans who have been mind-fucked by Russia** since March 2013. ===:::

"Honestly, mimicking Dementia Donald right back at him is a highly effective way to demonstrate how weird and childish he is behaving. There's very little he can do to respond without acknowledging his own words, so it will be even more effective in person. As dumb as our time line really is lately, maybe this dumb thing is what it takes to shut down Dementia Donald's roll."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fixated on ONE SINGLE PERSON. "Dementia" 79 year old. This has been gong on for OVER TEN FULL YEARS of non-stop mocking and insulting Donald Trump's performance of Tony Clifton from the social machine audience. " As dumb as our time line really is lately" - Reddit, August 19, 2025. So you want to add more and more dumb to the Russian information warfare since March 2013 and do nothing on social media to actually call out that this Tony Clifton behavior is Russian Kremlin Surkov methods. Psychological denial that Surkov won the information war, INCLUSIVE of this Reddit user. "mimicking Dementia Donald" is EXACTLY what USA We The People have been DOING FOR OVER A DECADE NON-STOP EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY, THE ENTIRE NATION A TOTAL MOCKERY!!!!

"It’s a cult. These people are literally delusional."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Time and time again you see these Twitter-length Tweet-think reaction comments on social media for OVER TEN YEARS. And you know what you do not see on social media comments? People saying: *let's all go to the public library and check out a book on* ***cult deprogramming*** *and start posting quotes and teachings from these books on our social media comments and postings!* Let's RESCUE the USA from the Kremlin information warfare! Let's address the Cambridge Analytica *aftermath* of fucked-up thinking patterns and cult behaviors. Instead, you just see people declare it is a cult and not have any civic duty of rescuing Americans from a lost Russian information war.
Reddit comment August 2025: "It’s a cult. These people are literally delusional." - The Atlantic article, [September 9, 2014: "At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. ***It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)  ===:::

"It's not blackmail. Trump is too stupid to blackmail. He'd almost certainly blurt out what he's being blackmailed for in an interview or something and render the blackmail useless.

The truth is even sadder. Trump admires Putin. Trump is a cheap bully and always has been. Like most bullies, he sees being violent and threatening as signs of strength and power. To him Putin really is the strongest leader in the world because people are scared of him and his actions. Putin hurts people for his own gain, basically as a daily action. Trump sees that as something to emulate.

Trump isn't bowing to Putin under duress. He's doing it out of honest admiration for his idol."

The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look.

"It goes way beyond this. For example, USAID was killed. How does that undermine science? Well, one of the things USAID did was buy vaccines for diseases prevalent "over there" to contain them before the came "over here" or led to geopolitical instability (think: al Quada-like groups). Money for those vaccines flowed back to basic research. Now, the big university immunology programs are dead because the money has been cut off. Years of longitudinal data have been lost. Research is set back a minimum of 20 years."

KKK, pro slavery, internment camps, infanticide, anti personal accountability, you all applauded tranies twerking like strippers at toddlers in libraries across America, tried to control the narrative in regards to homosexuals teaching gay tendencies and explicit homsexual acts in public schools, support and create ways for pedophiles to be a protected class by creating bullshit labels like MAPS and other evil degeneracy. We have the moral high ground and you and the rest of the degenerates from the left can keep seething and watching how men take charge and protect not only American children but tens out thousands of immigrant children who are no longer being sex trafficked for your cult lords' homsexual pleasures.

"Because they’ve isolated themselves so heavily that they honestly believe the only issue anyone has with him is his crassness on social media when in reality most people aren’t even aware of his mindless posts anymore. These people purposely avoid staying abreast of all the awful and detrimental things he does so they can stay supportive and when something does reach them they just chalk it up to being fake. Their choice of media gave them everything Biden did under a slanted microscope but is focused entirely on culture wars and distractions under Trump.

It’s why some of them seem so baffled when one of DTs insane policies of the week leaks through their safety net and they have to grapple with something he’s done that they don’t like. This is a carefully constructed house of cards that requires complete lobotomization to keep up with and devotion to media avenues that keep up the charade"

But then they'll mock someone over their appearance, particularly doing something very anti-progressive like fat shaming.

Then they justify it because "well JD Vance is a bully, so it's okay"

It's pretty great hypocrisy really.

How can people let Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" sit and rot on the shelf when Donald Trump is the role model of social media / media engagement? When Putin and Trump IRA have mind-fucked everyone in all the ways Neil Postman warned in 1985? People have learned NOTHING from Jean B and September 11, 2001 - terrorism is media addiction! Donald Trump MAGA is media addiction! Fox News audience is media addiction! Dehumanization via consumption of media. Compulsive self-harm. ===:::

People can see this in small groups or families (domestic abuse), but do not see it at the national levels of USA and Russia since March 2013.

"Biff won more than the movie's wildest dreams. We live in a timeline so extreme it would've been laughed out of a movie theater for being unrealistic.

Our Biff is the president of the US, is friendly with nations like Russia, is enacting the same trade policy that contributed to the great recession, is destroying all US relationships, including with Canada of all countries, and is actively destroying rule of law sending the country to a path akin to Nazi Germany.

Trump is the Biff who graduated from casinos with an admiration and aspiration for Adolf Hitler."

Putin is hoping to get American business into Russia as well, to make it more difficult for Ukraine and allies to strike him without getting America on our backs about it.

Even with death of Jesus, people are still driven by the fiction storytelling in The Bible to wreck Earth and believe in Heaven magic after death. If people in USA don't actually "love one another" while alive here on Earth, and hate and mocking and insulting Donald Trump is the core faith and desire, the outcomes of hate will rule. Regardless of which people are leading the nation. Woodstock 1969 teaching and sharing of Love / Peace / Compassion values, the hippies,, sustained the USA from wrecking the world even worse - but all that 1960's education has been abandoned for faith in machine lust hate and insulting and mocking Donald Trump. ===:::

"I think the Epstein files are the real distraction. He's literally shaking the very core of what our democracy is built on and every time he does all we see is someone talking about the Epstein files. Yes. That is important, but what will that matter if he's surrounded himself with his own state police, owns the house and senate, and the supreme court. He's taken steps to own the media. Not to mention the cult who will follow him no matter what he does.

There are larger issues at stake here. I think people think that there will be this groundswell of people denouncing Trump if the files were released. When he controls all the political apparatus we put in place to curtail the presidents power, the Epstein files won't matter, because it would be too late to do anything about it."

"That was actually part of the con itself. That wasn't ironic, it was purposely put forward in a calculated way so that when the Trump regime then actually went ahead and *did* rig the 2024 election results (via Musk and likely Thiel too) it would be political suicide for ANYONE on the left to question the integrity of the election itself.

Doesn't anyone else see this..?

They cried wolf so much that it became so unpalatable for Democrats to do the same, lest they are seen as pure hypocrites. It was a very very smart tactic, and I can only fucking hope that the truth comes out soon. To what extent this truth may affect American democratic institutions, I just don't know, because nobody can really know yet. But it probably will not be good for the country nonetheless.

He brought up and used the Epstein files in order to distract people to get into office. Then he got in and threw them out because he doesn't need the distraction anymore. Now he can carry out his original plan - the fascist takeover of the US."

"You're spot on with this and it is incredibly frustrating to see the same "that's nice, release the files" responses repeatedly being thrown out for every horrible thing the admin says or does. It's really beginning to feel like the withholding of the files is the distraction. Yes, they should be released, but there's no way we could trust whatever this admin releases anyway. So unless someone somewhere leaks original copies I think it's fair to just assume the worst: that everyone with any kind of power is in them. Every billionaire, every high ranking politician, every complicit Republican and Democrat that's currently letting him steamroll our Constitution for the fashy oligarchy. The whole "that's nice, release the files" thing is starting to feel like it was intentional to distract us from the big issues."

"Yeah, I think it's a coping mechanism - I think a lot of Americans failed to see this shit coming, and are having a very hard time dealing with reality, so instead of addressing things that are actually happening and dealing with reality, they are deflecting to something "easier" that gives them some kind of misguided hope - "is somehow somewhere these files are magically released, maybe Trump will lose tons of support and the Democrats will be able to win in 2028". I think that's what's going through their heads, and it's sadly very much impossible, but also a very bad coping mechanism... and it's not remotely helping anyone with anything."

Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.

"I feel like the problem goes deeper. Palestinian statehood and self-determination have been denied for 70 years. Blaming Netanyahu absolves Israel—and everyday Israelis—of complicity in the ethnic cleansing, and denial of human rights that occurs there.

It's like blaming Trump for America being a global bully. it's always been a global bully, Trump is just mask off. Israel's always been about ethnic cleasning, Bib is just the mask off version.

When Golda Meir said "there's no such thing as a Palestinian", have Israelis taken down streets in her honor? Is her name treated with the same disdain as those who tried to erase other ethnicities. Israel is a country that has plazas and streets named after Mehachem Begin—still, in 2025—and monuments to Olei Hagardom, terrorists."

Donald Trump has built his image on being *popular*, more popular than popular. Entertainment. Amusement. What Neil Postman writes about in Manhattan in year 1985. Rick Roderick, Duke Unviersity 1993: ["The simulation has outrun the so-called reality. That concept in Baudrillard he calls the “hyperreal”. Hyperreality is more real than real. This is… it actually sounds… if some of this sounds like advertising slogans: good. Because in Baudrillard the heritage of philosophy and social theory has passed over into advertising and television. So if it sounds superficial: good, because the theory, the world that he looks at has become superficial and banal. If it sounds hokey like a salesman’s pitch: good. The world he describes is the world of Jurassic Park, not of Dante. So that is all evidence on the side of Baudrillard if you follow the argument deep enough and with enough clarity. Okay let me explain the hyperreality; this is an important concept in Baudrillard. In Baudrillard, ah, we have already said that reality is simply that which could be simulated. Can’t be simulated: not real.

"
> The greatest irony of it all? This is actually the "deep state" at work and all those geniuses who've been saying "question everything" and "buttery males" are totally on board. What a twist!

That is the point behind Dale Gribble in King of the Hill. He sees conspiracies in everything, but cannot see the one right in front of his face."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “Conspiracy theories have long been used to maintain power: the Soviet leadership saw capitalist and counter-revolutionary conspiracies everywhere; the Nazis, Jewish ones. But those conspiracies were ultimately there to buttress an ideology, whether class warfare for Communists or race for Nazis. With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology – indeed, which can’t if they want to maintain power by **sending different messages to different people** – the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the world view itself. Conspiracy does not support the ideology; it replaces it. In Russia this is captured in the catchphrase of the country’s most important current affairs presenter: ‘A coincidence? I don’t think so!’ says Dmitry Kiselev as he twirls between tall tales that dip into history, literature, oil prices and colour revolutions, which all return to the theme of how the world has it in for Russia. And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy. More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, **one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism** about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a **renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls ‘white jamming’**. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ is the message of his media hounds. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.'” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019 ===:::

If people actually care about the topic of protecting girls from predatory abuse by elders, then Malala covers that topic on a global scale and is ASKING people to join with her as a global reformation. EMPHASIS on DATE of publication: July 10, 2019. Way before Donald Trump second term and "Epstein List" chanting all over Bluesky and Reddit. ["The Epstein Scandal Is Giving QAnon Everything Pizzagate Couldn’t"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-epstein-scandal-is-giving-qanon-everything-pizzagate-couldnt/) - the HIGH road is to **name drop Malala from Pakistan, over and over** - you can do that ALONG WITH saying "Epstein List" - but people don't take the high road, no matter how easy it is to use social media. Making Malala famous makes the Taliban Pakistan behavior compared to MAGA marriage to children behavior a global topic, a World Wide Web coverage of the topic. Mix in Iran and Palestine and MAGA as all Levant *conservative values*. In year 1775, life expectancy was WAY LOWER and perhaps marriage at age 15 made sense. But in year 2025 life expectancy is 75 years and we have over 8 billion people crammed on Earth fighting over greed and resources. ===:::

Ask them to study "1 John 3:17" and explain how it applies to Donald Trump and Elon Musk - and if Karl Marx from Germany invited the ideas expressed in Levant Bible 2,000 years ago of loving your enemy and sharing food and housing with the poor. Democracy will not work if people believe *hate thy neighbor, hate thy enemy* - and we need to face up that democracy government requires love and compassion for your fellow man. It isn't optional. Starving your fellow man so you can have $8 billion dollars more a year for your own self is a monster state. Like Russia run by Putin the past 25 years. The word the Bible uses in "1 John 3:17" for Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk and Donald Trump? **"Liar"** is what The Bible tells you to call these people in an audit statement, judgment statement. Yes, The Bible does tell you to judge people, that's the purpose of "1 John 3:17". The Bible is full of contradictory confusing poetry, and if We The People can't find "1 John 3:17" and apply it to Donald Trump... and all people can find is hate messages in The Bible - then we are doomed as a society. We can't even read a 2,000 year old storybook correctly! What hope do we have with the latest film, song lyrics, or video games when we can't even read The dusty old Bible correctly and [apply Matthew 6:5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church) and "1 John 3:17" to Donald Trump? ===:::

"If you look at his weird public relationship with religion where he won’t take a stance on his own beliefs but yet, is super def religious, it sheds some light. Not sure we should listen to someone for any subject that cannot define and stand by his own beliefs. He is an actor. He just wants to please the next the person he talks to for his career and not offend anyone. Nothing super wrong with that until one protects fascism and spread anti-science misinformation which actually hurts people."

Regarding Chris Platt and Donald Trump, if he is so poor at literacy he can't find verse "1 John 3:17' in that 2,000 year old story - what luck do you think Chris Pratt has reading year 1776 Founding Fathers writings if he can't comprehend 2,000 year old Bible fiction? This is a LITERACY problem, not a FAITH or "BELIEF" problem. It is not good to let people run around with fundamental misundersanding and comrpehension failures and act like they aren't misinterpreting other books, users manuals, websites, literature, art work! Test Chris Plat on some song lyrics, what wild interpretations does he come up with if he can't see "1 John 3:17" applies to Donald Trump judgement by Bible fiction fans? WISE UP USA - we have hundreds of millions of people who can't tell Russian Internet memes are fiction. We have people who think Fox news is nonfiction!

"Ah, the comment I was hoping to see!

If nobody said it, I was going to say the same thing. Been shopping at Target for about 20-25 years, they always seemed to be the high-end big box store with quality products. We all used to call them Targét for a reason…they were the snooty upper class suburban option.

Lately…and by lately I mean over the last 5 years or so, they’ve just been adding more junk. They’re still an option for standard commodity stuff like food, toiletries, books, toys that are identical to products you can buy elsewhere (although whether they’re cheaper is debatable…I usually have my Amazon app ready to price compare) but damn if their other products just don’t seem cheaper and more poorly made.

If it’s Target vs Walmart…I’m not seeing too much of a difference now. Except that Target is offering the same junk and higher prices and that won’t fly in this day of Trump-manufactured inflation"

"This headline is (a lot) misleading. Target has a policy that requires executives to step down at a certain age and this has been in the works for years. In fact, Brian Cornell was granted a few years extension on his contract.

He's leaving, but not because of declining sales, but because his contract ran out. I think Cornell made a bad decision in January to bend the knee. He did what he thought was right for shareholders, which is fine - I guess, but that decision had consequences that I don't think he anticipated or frankly cared too much about since he knew he was leaving later this year."

* “Educators may bring upon themselves unnecessary travail by taking a tactless and unjustifiable position about the relation between scientific and religious narratives. We see this, of course, in the conflict concerning creation science. Some educators representing, as they think, the conscience of science act much like those legislators who in 1925 prohibited by law the teaching of evolution in Tennessee. In that case, **anti-evolutionists were fearful that a scientific idea would undermine religious belief. Today, pro-evolutionists are fearful that a religious idea will undermine scientific belief. The former had insufficient confidence in religion; the latter insufficient confidence in science**. The point is that profound but contradictory ideas may exist side by side, if they are constructed from different materials and methods and have different purposes. Each tells us something important about where we stand in the universe, and it is foolish to insist that they must despise each other.”

"I thought they hated cancel culture" -is a gullibility crisis that was described Octoboer 19, 2024: ["Human gullibility is not a new phenomenon.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  The USA population in August 2025 is social media addicts, second hand consumption and direct consumption. One-line twitter-think messaging mania, tweet-thinking like this Reddit message chanting. Addicts to The Tony Clifton behaviors of the Trump White House and Kremlin for a decade have been mocking away in predictable patterns, exactly what Surkov information warfare induces. Compsuirvdly addicted to the sitmulation of media content (book media in this sitaution bieng deep symbol in the mind). As Neil Postman wrote in his 1985 book about this kind of one-line Reddit stream of meme *condtioned amusement* thinking:
- "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture" - Amused To Death, 1985. &nbsp;
Notice the Reddit meme consumer is amused and anticipaing the next act in the Surkov screenplay, Tony Clifton performance art. The media addics of USA, the entire society, doesn't want to face anti-intelleculism with books from Carl Sagan / Neil Postman / Malala / Joseph Campbell / Marshall McLuhan / Martin Luther King Jr ... the USA audience (We The People) are *entire engaged* in mocking the Tony Clifton act.

"The right functionally never planned to.

They recognized the power it had to reach so many young minds and wanted it for themselves. TikTok is a golden goose. They want the goose alive and for themselves, not dead.

They’ve spent this entire time attempting to force bytedance to sell it to an American company that the federal government could control.

TikTok absolutely represents a problem for humanity in the way its algorithm can and has shaped peoples minds, meaning the best choice is to perform a series of studies to analyze its effects, identify any problematic outcomes it contributes to, issue ultimatums on changing such effects, create a group within the government to monitor the ongoing effect for changes that violate whatever standards are being set, and in the event of the parent company refusing or failing to comply then drafting a piece of legislation that bans said platform.

The right wants to snake it so they can turn it into a propaganda machine for themselves. If trump could, I’m certain he’d force them to sell it to his “social media” company and rebrand it as “TrumpTok” or some other asinine thing."

"I am at a similar point with this.

I also agree with Jack - it has all been transparent to me from the start a decade ago. But all of his failings and shortcomings as a business man, family man, politician, and general citizen have been laid out ad nauseam at this point.

It really boils down to him being a reflection of the American people at this point. The problem is us, not really him anymore. We have invited this and have changed the course of our society, culture, politics, and economy.

Whatever comes after this won’t be easy to dial back. As much as I want him to fail because I think he’s terrible, it also means my county will have to fail too. That is not something I want to see.

I love being an American but not in this way. Let’s hope we can thread the needle and come out of this in a better way somehow."


* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "reflection of the American people at this point.

Carl Sagan called it **Celebration of Ignorance**. Donald Trump is the elebration of Twitter-logic Tweet reactionary thinking. Donald Trump is the celebration of Reddit and Fox News meme garbage and antics.
* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995 ===:::

"This. Their entire values and belief system has been permanently modified by decades of indoctrination by extremist conservative media telling them daily that Dems are destroying America and that the cult leader must break some rules to defend it. No different from Nazi Germany. And once the propaganda's rot entrenches itself, it's virtually impossible to stamp out. They will go to their graves with their dumb beliefs.

Consider it took full occupation by foreign powers and decades upon decades for Nazism to disappear from Germany. Even after Allied powers' efforts to de-Nazify, years after the war ended, the truths and horrors being revealed, mountains of contradictory evidence, yet the population wasn't easily deprogrammed. They essentially had to just wait for the older generations to die off.

For instance, in 1952, still 68% of Germans polled believed other countries started the war. It wouldn't be until the 1960s, nearly 20 years after the war, before it was less than a majority. Or in another polling example: a full decade after the war (1955) nearly a majority answered 'yes' to the proposition 'were it not for the war, mustache man would've been one of the greatest statesmen of the 20th century.'

Cult indoctrination is notoriously difficult to deprogram. And we're suffering from a [personality cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality) characteristic of countless failed democracies throughout history. But the inoculation to cult demagoguery is an educated and questioning populace before they succumb to the cult. If Nazi Germany is any indication, odds are the 15-25% of America that are full blown maga won't suddenly have an epiphany and come back to reality.

We're only a few steps away from invocation of the Insurrection Act and deployment of the military into US cities under martial law. And with an arsenal of 5,000 nuclear weapons, we won't have the luxury of being invaded by anyone. This is on us Americans, and Americans alone to fight this evil. Nobody is coming to save us."

Democrat Tariffs Are Raising Taxes on all American by More Than 30%!!!! Small Businesses are Collapsing Thank to Democratic Tariff Policy. Why is Congress Silent on Democratic Tariiffs?

These supporters see Trump is doing taxing them into bankruptcy and business failure, and instead of getting angry about it, these bozos are pleading with him to reconsider. As if.

On each of those accounts I filed an appeal after this account was restored. In each case the appeal was rejected, because they found I "violated the rules", with no further clarification.

Again, this was all because their killbot falsely suspended this one account for what appeared to be an AI hallucination.

"When Trump dies, MAGA implodes.

There is no heir to the throne. If Trump wanted MAGA as a movement to outlast him he'd have groomed a successor and familiarized the base with them, but he can't abide the spotlight being on anyone but himself so he hasn't. When he dies, conservative notables will nominate themselves as his "spiritual successor" and try to capture the MAGA vote. But there's no one on the scene who comes anywhere near being Trump's obvious follow-up, so the base will tear itself apart in factional infighting."

The rest of JDs cronies are already installed in every major tech company and key government positions. Things will fly when they can finally get rid of Trump.

And I think the slow release of Epstein files is just to give Trump time to die before it causes them bigger issues. Once he's dead they can say fuck it and put that behind them too.

I do think the base will be fragmented, but they've got plenty of time to essentially end the midterm elections, and these idiots still won't vote for a Democrat but they'll stand in line all day to vote for someone they don't like."

But it will not be an authentic media addiction wake (Dublin Finnegans Waie, 1924 publication onward), it will just b onion peeling of a few layers of the largest onion in all human history in terms fo monomyth fiction patterns.

Neil Postman's 1985 book 'Amusing Ourselves To Death" on media ecology (electric media, Fox News, Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter, TikToK, etc) tries to explain. The older 1985 book perspective is key to getting people to realize how much social media addiciton has come to direct life in USA.

"I’ve lived in the Deep South my whole life.

All around me the church goers have always acted like they are the most persecuted people on the planet, and like no one has suffered as much as Christians.

Going to church as a kid, I was almost immediately turned off because the second you questioned anything you were treated like an outcast it felt like. You weren’t part of the “in group” anymore.

Note: As a kid, the only question I really had was “Why do we act like Judas and the Romans are bad guys for what they did to Jesus?” because in my kid brain I thought that, if it was all God’s plan, then they should not be punished or hated for their actions.

It was more of questioning how we had free will if everything was God’s plan, because those two things contradict each other.

It later evolved into questioning things like how are Christians persecuted if people of that faith control pretty much all of Western civilization?

Like… it’s absolutely wild to me, and even as an adult I can’t grasp how people don’t see all the contradictions."

What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means **misleading information -- misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information -- information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 which is eleven years before October 7, 1996 opening of Fox News on Putin's birthday. ===:::

"I firmly believe it was Miller’s personal insights to the inner workings and frustrations of incel and y’allqueda psychology that has led to Trumps success and popularity. He perfectly articulates the delusions of a nation, gender, culture under attack and presents it as fact, preying on their vulnerabilities. The sick part is, these supporters are hurt by problem they face that were created in whole by decades of conservative destruction of the fabric of American culture that was forming organically from the strengths of the diverse, educated populous. This was too much success for conservatives, or rather, too many people succeeding at living their lives as they pleased. To turn it around and effectively assign blame on the people who were actually living and fighting for incels success and happiness is a level an evil and masterful manipulation I will never understand. I can’t imagine being so deceived that knowing the history of this world and the U.S., one can think that Stephen Miller’s world view is the solution and not the problem. This is a main reason why they are now looking to rewrite history in a fictional way that would supports this delusion. It will make the deception much easier if there is no truth to counter it."

You know what he reminds me of? A 7 year old kid that is so insecure that he lies about anything and everything to make him seem cool or whatever because otherwise, nobody would pay any attention at all. I wish he would have gone to public school. He would have received the humbling from other kids that he so desperately needed.

Can you imagine how many things he would say while growing up started with “my father…” followed by him making threats as if his father gave a fuck. Christ he’s insufferable. Provided humans somehow survive long enough to have decent written history of this time, future generations will marvel at how we let someone mentally incapable of almost everything into office, then stood by while weakening the country, shutting down the government, and stomping his feet like an angry toddler every day.

There are 15 Democratic trifecta states (full Democrat control). These 15 states have 130 Democrat seats and 32 Republican seats.

Until or unless there is violence initiated against Republican politicians by their own deep red constituents at a scale that cannot be written off as some kind of deep state plot, we are all just passengers watching the ship burn from its deck.

They own the country now, the American public willingly sold it to them in exchange for the promise that people different than them would be hurt, despite the protests of tens of millions.

Unfortunately, for the overwhelming majority of people, trying to make the best of a broken world and raise children in it is preferable to leaving them orphaned or just dying outright.

Religion is inherently incompatible with democracy. Religion doesn't teach democracy, the entire belief system is based around a single entity controlling the universe - the ultimate dictator.

It actively discourages independent, critical thought. It teaches that your church and pastors have all the answers to everything and that going against them is morally wrong. It's not democracy if one, infallible pastor can convince a whole town of people to vote a certain way on the threat of eternal damnation. It's theocracy with extra steps.

And in creating the right kind of public, the schools contribute toward strengthening the spiritual basis of the American Creed. That is how Jefferson understood it, how Horace Mann understood it, how John Dewey understood it, and in fact, there is no other way to understand it. The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, **What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens?** Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion.

I have spoken out. Many have spoken out. Good friends, family have ignored it and didn’t care. I’ve lost my father and uncle to this Trump cult and they don’t want to hear it. They call me deranged (TDS). What do you do when speaking up only pushes away the people I’d most like to reach?

I’m so sad that the people I loved held values that they so easily tossed aside. My grandfathers both fought in WW2 against fascism. They put their lives on the line against this, but all of their children fell in line supporting this narcissistic dictator, and they don’t even see it.

I went to a New Year’s party with my uncle last year. One of the gents at the party, my uncle’s good friend was so sad that his wife of 40 years was divorcing him, literally over Trump.

"Having talked to servicemen and retired servicemen, the brainwashing and shall we say "reshaping" of people's personalities when they go into the service is troubling, to put it mildly. I get it - you have to make people into effective fighting units that will follow orders without question and be willing to kill or be killed without hesitation. Unfortunately, it takes very little tinkering with that formula to make them all too eager to obey and kill, and very little effort to create new "others" who are the "enemies of freedom" and who need to be killed. Obviously, not all soldiers are like this, and a bit too much exposure to reality snaps some of them out of the supposed glory of violence in the name of one's nation, but in general you can't expect the military to save you from a dictatorship."

"This thread is chock full of ridiculous stereotypes. Everybody acting like they "know" the nerds.

"Mmmactually it was the nerds who were the pricks in high school, not the popular guys"

Was that high school on fucking Mars? The popular people in my high school were vicious assholes. They were getting into fist fights regularly and picking fights with anyone they thought were too weak to fight back.

We had a computer lab where "socially disadvantaged" kids would attend classes but would also practice programming and bounce ideas off each other during free time. Just collaborating and minding their own business. Well the "popular" kids would sometimes come into the lab and physically harass the people using the computers and taunting them. Calling them (said with air quotes by the "cool" kids) "hackers".

"Hey Mike, you going to hack into the FBI mainframe lol" while grabbing their wheeled chairs and flinging them across the room.

Just dumb shit.

Maybe it's because I was in a dying working class hockey town but the "cool" kids fucking sucked and the "nerds" literally weren't hurting anybody. They were probably just trying to get good enough at programming so they could get the hell out of this shitty town.

It seems to be that people are taking the worst examples of silicon valley moguls (who are absolutely off the rails insane) and applying them to people they didn't much care for in high school for what ever reason. The people that have risen to the top of the heap in silicon valley are a rare breed of ruthless sociopaths who just happen to be technically inclined. If you want someone to blame for the situation then blame corporate America. Every industry, whether it's tech or medicine or automotive, rewards the worst of the worst for ruthless short term cost cutting thinking. It's all about making the share holders happy.

The nerds from our high school didn't create this situation. This is late stage capitalism and it's pervasive in every single industry. The tech moguls are the lightning rods for everyone's ire lately because their influence is so all encompassing and they're playing with people's lives by cosying up to fascist elements within the ruling class."

"Many many wealthy people have zero idea what things cost and how an actual budget for living works. This isn't some form of hyperbole, it's real. This is one reason so many support minimum wage either being removed or kept low because they actually believe that you can survive on $7.50 an hour. They likely don't even realize that minimum wage barely exceeds $15k a year and that won't even cover rent in roughly half the homes someone could rent BEFORE TAX and not even including food, transportation, and healthcare (which at that level pay is often non-existent.) That also assumes you'll get 40 hours each week which you WON'T because the business doesn't want you getting to close to overtime hours. These same folks also don't believe in food stamps because all food stamps users are apparently drug addicts and lazy folks who don't want to work. They also think the reason many people are poor, if it isn't laziness, is because they buy frivolous things like cell phones or a streaming subscription.

"Have you ever watched Fox "News"?

It is genuinely batshit insane, unfiltered propaganda. Like always sensationalist, often utterly divorced from reality, and highly curated to increase outrage and a faux sense of self-righteousness alongside a very discrete set of marching orders for viewers to follow. It is genuinely hard for me to watch because it is so obviously manipulative, from the loaded framing of rhetorical questions and statements, the headlines/ticker reels they use being outlandishly inflammatory and unfactual, and the blatent lack of any sort of journalistic integrity amidst their elaborate editorialization. Just an entertainment channel masquerading as news that people erroneously consider a reliable source. 

It is on EVERYWHERE in the south and midwest. It is just playing, by default, in most any public space that has a television. It is on in restaurants and bars and diners. In hotel lobbies. They leave it on in their homes, playing on the TV endlessly. Just constant background noise. My aunt left it on and playing in the other room during Thanksgiving dinner. It is ALWAYS on. In the car there is Fox News Radio. A 24 "news" cycle, like a weird mental pacifier that leaves them the opposite of pacified, that they seek out like addictive bubblegum for their brain to passively chew while a fox host feeds them digested bits of filtered information and how best to "interpret" it. 

That is the problem. Genuinely, it's just Fox News. They have cut the legs out from under the 4th Estate. They are just the personal PR platform for a political Party that subverts the integrity of journalism and lies and misrepresents information CONSTANTLY in order to keep people that seek out no other source of information thinking that they are the only choice worth voting for, despite the obvious and repeated damage it does to them."

"So while Trump is obviously ignorant of a great many things, one thing he's pretty tuned into is the perceptions of his base. He has an almost unique insight into what they want to see and hear and like a weathervane is able to align himself in that direction. He also quickly corrects when the wind changes - remember how he got booed for taking credit for the vaccine? He never tried that again.

I'm saying all this to point out: for his base, sounding like a crazy person isn't a dealbreaker. It's actually part of his appeal. When they turn on the TV and hear a loud ignorant man ranting and raving about stuff he doesn't understand, they point at the TV and shout, "He's just like me!"

This is why he was so quick to stage that photo op on his assassination attempt. We can debate whether he was really struck by a bullet or just debris, but it doesn't matter because his base cares more about appearances than reality, and Trump understands that. It's why they voted for a TV star that played a successful businessman, not an actual successful businessman. So looking tough is more important than being tough.

If you're still with me after all this, I promise I'm getting to my point now. The reason Trump is so quick to cover his hand or any sign of infirmity is that he knows his base will follow him across almost any bridge... *except* if he starts looking weak. MAGA cannot abide weakness. As soon as he has a serious issue in public that he can't cover up, the spell will break on a lot of them. Not all of them of course, but a lot of them won't tolerate a weak Trump. They truly believe he's this strong virile male specimen. Hell, I suspect some of them even think he's actually hiding Rambo-era Stallone's body under those ill-fitting suits."

"But at the same time, who's going to hold them responsible? The U.S. certainly won't. Additionally, this regime will last for decades. The GQP has already set up a line of succession even after F47 is gone. It's unlikely any of us within eyeshot will see the end of GQP rule. Small children today might. *Maybe.*

Therefore, nobody committing war crimes today will ever be held responsible. They'll be long dead before that ever happens.

Given the Current Environment, I don't trust the military anymore than I do cops. The overwhelming majority of current military are GQP loyalists. They're not loyal to the Constitution, and they certainly aren't loyal to civilians. They're loyal to the regime, and they'll do anything the regime commands them to."

I'm not a believer, but I was raised in the catholic church and confirmation at our parrish required a lot of study. I can count on one hand how many times in my adult life I've heard a christian talk about their beliefs and been like "yeah, they actually follow scripture".

When it would be much easier and effective to say yeah of course a movement in opposition to israel will inevitably attract antisemitic opportunists, there is nothing that can be done to combat this other than disavowing them, but that shouldn't distract you from the fact that the Israeli government is trying to ethnically cleanse Gaza.

"Because there’s a lot more antisemitism on the Right from far more influential voices atp who uh, tend to support Israel as a shield and because they hate Muslims. That’s why it gets handwaved away. It’s not as prevalent on the pro Palestine side as it is on the side that regularly espouses support for Israel. To say they are remotely the same is giving undeserved credibility to orgs like the ADL who are less concerned with Jewish safety and more concerned with peddling in hasbara, Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian racism.

Once you involve everybody, a cause can easily come to be defined by what brought people to the cause, instead of the core idea.

Josh Johnson had a really good bit about this effect in the "Men's Rights" movement, how it had started as fathers united by their struggle to see their children in custody disputes, but because of the name they'd settled on they rapidly attracted angry men who were bitter they weren't getting dates. And then that's what the movement was, because of who it had attracted, and the original core idea was lost in the noise.

When you invite the people on board with your idea, it's so important to be careful how you do it, because your idea *will* be replaced by whatever unifies the crowd it attracts. Which is how "PLEASE let's stop killing people" becomes "YEAH, let's kill DIFFERENT people"."

"It's insane. I was involved in republican politics until about 20 years ago while I was still young. Family influence as well as active political campaigns in town. There were people who operated on principles. Granted, the principles they operated on are not ones I agree with, but still, there was coherence and I think they truly believed they were making good choices.

For context, this was in NJ, which had historically had a republican party that was not concerned with social conservatism and even had a fairly normal view of environmental protection for the beginning of the century. Then the obvious happened. Once could see that things started shifting around the beginning of the Bush admin. I had left any engagement with their politics around that time, but by the arrival of Obama, things were already completely broken by the 40 years of the "Southern Strategy," which in no way was limited to the South.

Now, the US has a party built on the types of divides that have started revolutions in the past, except their divisions are fictitious or, in my mind, illegitimate and inhumane. We've set ourself up for a continent-wide Cambodia in the name of Supply-Side Jesus. The Republican party, voters included sadly, isn't a political organization any more. It's a nation wide terrorist organization that is waiting for activation."

"Facts and logical reasoning are unimportant to them and have been for decades. The anti-intellectualist movement started spreading all over the rural US in the 1980's and nobody bothered to shut it down. Now the cancer has spread to every layer of society, and no amount of reasoning with them will help because they scorn intelligence and critical thinking and those who possess it."

A totally normal offer to just literally go for a walk and talk about an issue is met with fury and anger, simply because that person has a D next to their name.

"But how much did he construct himself, and how much of that was manufactured by GOP and Russian troll army. I'm a bit creeped out how many MAGA hats took Russian money https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrlv7jdnq8o It shows Russia is working on a lot of people, not just Trump. So it's not impossible they'd manufacture another bullshit icon.

Dems can't count on whoever follows Trump to be a dork. They are going to need Jon Stewart grade candidate for the next election :T And as much as I'd like it to be someone AoC or Kamala, there's way too much misogyny in the middle. It's going to take a generational shift before the candidate being a woman stops being an issue."
