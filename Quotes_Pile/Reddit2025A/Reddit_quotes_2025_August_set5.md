"The double standard is glaring. They cry about being attacked while dishing out violence themselves. It's mind-boggling how they can't see the irony."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Glaring like Tony Clifton act on stage and Tony Clifton audience interaction. That's the whole point of Donald Trump / MAGA / Kremlin Surkov governing techniques. The [more glaring the contradictions](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), the more power and wealth are concentrated. ===:::

"What’s absolutely fucking crazy is all the people who’ve always had this mindset are now raging maga. It’s like their brains are wired to just be a piece of shit"

"It's ironic because this MAGA is PRETENDING to be offended that someone threw something at ICE. This is all performative means to an end. They told us who they were 5 years ago, and everything else is grift."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction and PRETENDING far outsells nonfiction. Donald Trump PRETENDING he is Tony Clifton character far outsells authhentic and sincere leaders. I don't consider MAGA ironic as much as exploiting irony addiction, irony poisoning, poisoning nonfiction with audience (We The Peoople) spectacle addiction. ===:::
