"The double standard is glaring. They cry about being attacked while dishing out violence themselves. It's mind-boggling how they can't see the irony."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Glaring like Tony Clifton act on stage and Tony Clifton audience interaction. That's the whole point of Donald Trump / MAGA / Kremlin Surkov governing techniques. The [more glaring the contradictions](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), the more power and wealth are concentrated. ===:::

"It's ironic because this MAGA is PRETENDING to be offended that someone threw something at ICE. This is all performative means to an end. They told us who they were 5 years ago, and everything else is grift."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction and PRETENDING far outsells nonfiction. Donald Trump PRETENDING he is Tony Clifton character far outsells authhentic and sincere leaders. I don't consider MAGA ironic as much as exploiting irony addiction, irony poisoning, poisoning nonfiction with audience (We The Peoople) spectacle addiction. ===:::

"In keeping with where you are headed, I would love nothing more than to see the shittiest 1/3 of this country get tried and put away for 20+ years under RICO laws/statutes."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Even before Donald Trump was elected to POTUS in November 2016 - USA society had such faith in prison systems that it is a neading society of "tried and put away" values. ["Comparison of United States incarceration rate with other countries"](Comparison_of_United_States_incarceration_rate_with_other_countries). This twitter-length Bluesky-length Twitter-thinking message on Reddit August 16, 2025 wants to build massive prison concentration camps for the poorly educated audience of Fox News and social media, saying "I would love nothing more than to see the shittiest 1/3 of this country get tried and put away" - the emphsis on the word *love*, how much this person thinks that love means putting political opponents "away" for decades. Reddit is mind-fucking peopel with these simplsitic ideas. ===:::

"J6 deniers might be the worst people in the country. J6 was the most filmed crime in the history of the world. The documentation of their crimes is mountainous and conclusive and they’re still gaslighting us about what the day was and why it happened. They can do it because they know the President agrees with their version of reality but facts are facts. Video doesn’t lie."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction and insulting outsells nonfction. [Eating the Surkovian onions](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) on a Putin visit to Alaska. Simplstic reactionary to the Tony Clifton behaviors of Putin and Trump onn the world media stages, eating the Onion of the Tony Clifton acts. Surkov won, Russia won.

USA population and leadership (all of USA) does not understand, grasp, or know how to fight back in a War Against Reality.

"Those YouTube comments are something else. Trump is a mastermind in their eyes, having the bravery to lower his "western ego" and talk "like an adult" with Putin, when Zelensky "pouted like a spoiled child".

Fuck all those commenters to hell. GD traitors! Putin invaded Ukraine and is attempting to steal land. When and where will it end if the rest of us just allow it?"

Go look at the conservative subreddit. They’re jerking themselves off over this. They’re literally gaping their assholes so that Putin can ram his tiny little Russian penis in and impregnate them with more Russian propaganda."

"What are you talking about??

tRump, a career criminal and aspiring global dictator invited another criminal and dictator for afternoon tea because tRump wants to learn “dictator 101” from putzky. That’s why tRump is also so infatuated with xi and kim. He wants to be in the dictator club real bad.

The only time tRump expends effort or time into something is if he can gain something from it. The funny, or sad, thing is that tRump thinks himself clever enough to pull something over on vladdy. If tRump has a goal and someone/something is in his way, he has no problem either stepping over it….or ON it."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : No citations, no references, no authors noted. No mention of Surkov public relations techniques. No mention of Adam Curtis, Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev, etc. Just lots of name-calling and mocking about egoism of how much this user is smarter than Kremlin and White House... but can't cite Peter Pomerantsev. [Eating the Surkovian onions](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) in egomania. "The funny, or sad, thing is that tRump thinks himself clever enough to pull something over on vladdy" - the sad and sick thing is that this Reddit user believes they should do what Reddit HiveMind craves, off-the-cuff comments like this without linking or quoting author Peter Pomerantsev (publshed way back in September 2014). The IRA has been online since March 2013... this shitshow of avoiding serious discourse on information warfare techniques has been going on for over a decade. ===:::

Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amsuing Ourselves To Death" - this Twitter-length Bluesky-length reaction comment amused at the situation. Kremlin techniques since March 2013 exploit amusement / funny / LOL reactions. Absennt in the comment:  mention of Adam Curtis, Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev. People just mock and insult back (LOL) day after day since March 2013 and don't organize or rally around key authors like Peter Pomerantsev who explain modern information warfare against realiity. ===:::

"This is why I hate the internet. Some shrub makes an image like this trying to make it show that these soldiers are bowing to a foreign leader when they are just working and securing a carpet it looks like. Its the same as that stupid image of students doing a tornado drill and the poster thinking they are praying for islam or whatever. Some people really need to get some help."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Everything is Media Ecology...](../../Media_Ecology/Everything_is_ME.md) "Some shrub makes an image like this" - one single person makes it. But a crowd attracted to Reddit and the total mockery White House / Kremlin of Surkov media techniques.... lines up to react-comment. Simualcra abounds. No mention of Adam Curtis, Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev, etc. Just lots of name-calling and mocking. No learning, as Neil Postman explains in his 1985 book, this is anti-learning. "What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that **creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing**. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that **when news is packaged as entertainment**, that is the inevitable result."  ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business ===:::
