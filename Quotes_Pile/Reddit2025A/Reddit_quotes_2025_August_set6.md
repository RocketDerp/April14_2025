"Within a week or so of Donnie meeting with Putin so he can be told what Vlad expects from him, Russia did a massive missile strike on Kyiv and killed more than a dozen people and wounded hundreds.

Civilians. That is what Russia attacks with their missiles. They do not use their missiles against the Ukrainian troops slaughtering their own soldiers, with a casualty ratio of 4:1 in favor of the Ukrainian defenders.

Why is Russia fighting this way? Because they intend to simply destroy Ukraine on all fronts until it collapses. This is known.

"If you watch the video, it is a specific term. It is understood by Russia's neighbors all too well. It is the name for Russian imperial delusions.

"Russism" is the belief that Russia is the center of a genuine historically real empire, that includes the Baltic states, ceretainly all of Eastern Europe, but historically Ukraine has been the chief prize of Russist fantasies. Ukraine, is Russia, according to Russism.

It's this idea of a "Greater Russia" which includes, btw, Alaska. It's a delusion. But that video is from 1995, the Yeltsin years. 30 years ago, people who were soon to be assassinated (Dudayev was assassinated shortly after this video, and Chechnya is now a Russian vassal) told us what we are facing today."

"Also Maga IS Trump. A cult rarely ever survives after the leader dies. Heck one cult survived only because the newest leader pretended that the original leader was just in some kind of spiritual sleep and would return, and even then they still didn't last that long.

Many have tried to be the new Trump and has fallen flat. I honestly don't know what it is, I personally find him about as appealing as a hangnail. But some people find him charismatic, and that's like the main weapon of a cult leader.

JD Vance is already disliked by many even in the Maga verse, with some already calling for Rubio to take over instead of Vance. His level of weird awkwardness, is close to that of Ron DeSantis.

Plus some will just be too depressed after. It's gonna happen and I'm genuinely worried about the rise in rates of self exits that might happen.

I recently saw a video of a woman recording her dad where she faked reading an article that Trump died and his reaction was on the same level as if someone told him someone killed his own mother.

"I am also genuinely worried about the rise of self-exits after MAGA realizes they have been lied to and taken for suckers... after they already lost their entire family, probably all of their non-like-minded friends, support group(s), and substantial amounts of money, whether via donations or merch. They gave up their entire lives... their life savings... their families, even their own children, for THIS?

Edit: There will probably also be a new flavor of scam for those who have no desire to self-exit; maybe they will promise to help you get your family and/or money back. They are still gullible and easily led after all, that part wouldn't change..."

"My biggest worry is for farmers. They already have a higher than average self exit rate.

"The National Rural Health Association reports that farmers are 3.5 times more likely to die by s****e than the general population."

And they're more common to be family annihilators, so not only would they take themselves out, but there is the potential of them taking their whole family with them.

"It's pretty adorable that you guys incessantly post this stuff on reddit as if it will spur anyone with any real authority into action.

This is purely performative on your end. Why don't you write a boilerplate letter and ask people to send it to their representatives if the files being released is so important to you?

It's also pretty funny that you think anyone actually cares whether Trump is on the list or not, which is assuredly is. The public has known he's a sleazy pervert for decades now, and they love him for it. No one who voted for him cared about the Access Hollywood tapes, and they don't care about his trips to pedo island."

Elon Musk has already announced he won’t push for a 3rd party, instead he is putting his support behind Vance. With Trump being sick it’s not long before Vance is in control.

Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team which most people have forgotten is really USDS which has access to most federal agencies. Understand that the decision by Trump to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far. Timothy Haugh like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir (just got $10 BILLION contract with the US government) who is now the biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA based on publicly available data on DOD contracts (they had $750 million added to their current contract a while back) along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies. ⁠Palantir is contracted with state and local governments and police here in the U.S. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.

Now comes the push for removing Trump from office.

Elon was the early test to see if scapegoat mechanism would work and it sort of did for him. Which is sort of the plan, scapegoat mechanism at its finest. Peter is a ⁠key believer of scapegoat mechanism for which he says Trump fills that role. Thiel has been grooming JD Vance since 2011 as his benefactor and mentor, Thiel brought Vance to Mar-a- Lago to smooth over things with Trump so Vance could be VP, Thiel gave Vance $15 million in donations to run for Senate (the largest amount of money ever donated to a single Senate candidate ever)

Scapegoat mechanism is simple that you have someone in power take on a lot of bad actions then remove them and so the masses feel it’s been all undone. The test case was Elon and DOGE which worked perfectly seeing as how all the federal investigations into Elon are gone and DOGE is still at all the federal agencies. Elon’s employee Amanda Scales still has the private server setup at OPM. All the data they got from the federal agencies and Treasury department when they had hard physical access is still under their control.

In September when the gap fund bill signed in March expires along with the deferred resignation program kicking in and the SSA/IRS data being handed over to Palantir as part of the doge plan they have provided for updating the SSA system there could be a lot of reasons for him to be removed from office.

Peter Thiel/Palantir just got what they wanted, access to a big enough database for the first step in complete surveillance.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/30/trump-citizenship-database

Peter is also a major defense contractor for the UK intelligence community and army along with the major police forces in the UK. He branched out to their healthcare a few years ago with a contract to shift through all the data at NHS England which is done now so Kier announced that NHS England will be shutdown (not NHS). Peter through his company has full access to Norway’s government and civilian surveillance services. Peter/Palantir provides direct support for the IDF (Israel) in all their operations from Gaza to the West Bank to Iran.

Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7

Alex Karp the ceo of Palantir knew Thiel well before 2003 when Thiel tapped him to be ceo. Karp has condemned “woke” ways of thinking, calling woke a central risk to Palantir, that Palantir is a counter-example to companies he considers woke. Karp condemned pro-Palestine protests calling them an infection inside of our society, he remarked the peace activists are war activists and they should be sent to North Korea. Karp has said the west has a superior way of living and said he supports Palantir contract with ICE and using the software to enable separation of families.

"Trump doesn’t have shit. The bottom line is that MAGA voters want a bad person to do the deplorable things they wish upon others but are too cowardly to execute themselves. So “liking” the guy is entirely beside the point.

Thats why creeps like Ted Cruz stay in power forever despite being utterly repulsive. It doesn’t matter. Being likeable doesn’t matter. Trump never needed to be likeable, he only needed to be ruthless.

Vance will have to prove himself to the same crowd. Is he willing to do what his voters won’t, to punish the people they hate? That is what matters.

At the end of the day, they’ll get behind Vance as long as he proves himself to be cruel enough to do the dirty work of America’s worst people."

"Buying the lie is not about being a moron, it’s about the lie being a power move. Most of Trump’s appeal is that he’s strong, so he can say any lie he wants. The more blatant the lie is the better, because accepting a blatant lie just further proves how strong he is. And if you don’t accept it then you’re outed as not being a true conservative.

It can be really hard from the outside to understand the conservative mindset, because it looks like conservatives are simultaneously believing contradictory things, sometimes within the same sentence. We throw around terms like cognitive dissonance, but no matter how much they’ve drunk the cool-aid for that to be cognitive dissonance would be wild.

But it’s not cognitive dissonance because it’s not about belief, just like with everything else with conservatives it’s about posturing and hierarchy. The lies aren’t actually lies, they’re power moves. And repeating them isn’t about believing them, it’s about solidifying your place in the hierarchy. It’s communication, but it’s not about communicating ideology, it’s a pack of dogs posturing submissiveness to the alpha."

"Watching the fall of the Rome (USA) has been an interesting sight, they labeled their pretorian guard after the most disgusting part of the Nazi regime (SS). They sold their liberty to their enemies gladly for money (like the Greeks who sold out for byzantine emperors). It has been interesting watching how they turned from liberty for all to all hail the emperor, they got nothing in exchange but they stilled applauded.

Like the romans they had influence around the world but once they fractured and turned their focus on interior squabbles, it disappeard. As it almost entirely made up stuff to grab power one quote resonates in my mind. A quote from John Milton "I rather rule in hell than serve in heaven". But as the roman empire did, the American followed. They both fell inevitable into disparity and disrepair.

Bye bye America as number one in cultural export, they are no longer number one in anything and most of Amerika fell below most third world countrys in almost all statistics (already has)."

You know that old adage about how "A lie makes it around the world before the Truth even gets its boots on". This is basally the physical manifestation of that.

Side note: I will never stop calling it Twitter, but what even is the new name for a "Tweet" if the channel is branded as "X"? "X posts"? "X'es"?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media specific to a political party, media built around Fox News fiction storytelling, Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" fiction entertainment patterns is toxic to society in total. Neil Postman in 1985 published a book titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about this style of media techniques.
“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 ===:::

"One of Trump's first public displays on his 2016 campaign trail was him blatantly mocking a disabled reporter in mannerisms & speech. They all know bullying so well it comes second nature to them.

I believe that's partly to blame for their blinders here - they truly don't believe "the left" would mock & belittle somebody like that, so they take Newsome at face value.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in **the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming**, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995 ===:::

"That actually sounds *very* Catholic.

> If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

- James 2:15-17

Their prayers are worthless because they chose to pray instead of doing something."

"Except it won't just be tariffs causing it. Trump is meddling with the Fed, raising questions about hiw independent the dollar. He's interfering with the regulatory agencies and judicial branch, which means businesses cannot trust America to have a stable legal system. (And stability is what is wanted). He's laid off thousands of federal workers, all over the nation, which not only means workers that will be unemployed BUT also cripples the government's ability to function AND the benefits the public gets from the government. His tariffs have pushed suppliers and nations away from the US who will have little reason to return-again, stability-and now will have worser trade deals. Finally, the increased deficit spending on tax cuts (aka no deal benefit) simply means the US will spend more and more on interest."

"Part of that price increase is because of the ICE raids in the beef packing houses across the country. They have come in and basically shut the plants down because the workers have all been deported. The ones who have been able to continue operations are limping along with skeleton crews. These plants are now facing implementing automation. Or hiring American workers rather than immigrant employees. This will cost these plants more than double what they paid immigrant workers. That’s if they can even hire Americans to work in these places.

"I am just an armchair economist watching things unfold and I think this recession could be the big one, possibly so damaging and prolonged that it actually upends the US as the global economic leader and hands the mantle to China.

Everyone knows there is a recession every 10-15 years. Companies get too greedy, lie to inflate valuations, they cut jobs and expenses too much and the whole thing collapses.

This has become a fairly accepted cycle in the business world and on Wall St.

Whenever this would happen the adults would step in, create some regulations and let things slowly rebuild.

The problem is there are no more adults in the room. Trump is starting trade wars with historic allies and driving up the costs of all products for seemingly no gains. They have fired the stats people from the labor board because they didn't like the numbers (and would prefer to publish fake ones that make things seem great). They are beginning a wholesale assault on the Fed, the last bastion of sanity and hope for an economic recovery and will do eventually replace JPow with some talking head from TV that Trump likes but has no idea what they are doing.

There is a good chance that the US/Trump will lean towards the Turkish economic policy of inflation doesn't exist and if it did it will just balance itself out and that will cause a catastrophic spiral downwards"

" "violence is never the answer" is a statement only uttered by cowards and predators."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : By that simplistic Twitter-thinking logic messaging, Putin is not a predator because violence is a frequent answer. Willing to ide for violence, human tradition. Willing to die for terrorism, the new human technology way. School shootings, Islamic (newest of the Levant big religions, 600 years newer thatn Christianity, newer than Hindu) jihad choice. Just a matter of time until technology invents even easier ways for one person to murder and kill others in mass. Keep passing down to over 8 billion people that violence is good. Simplstic thinking. May as well stop investigating airplaine crashes and making cars safer, because if you don't deal with the pscyological problems of human brains and artifical intelligence finding that violence is the answer - terrorism will become the outcome from human beings who already terrorize the air / water / animals of the Earth. Humans in USA already think spreading biological weapons, meaasles and COVID-19 is thrilling gleeful fun. Violence via disease is welcomed with the education passed around. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 Don't defend against biologicla weapons, "is a statement only uttered by cowards and predators" pretzel logic. Because war, terrorism, murder, suicide bombers, starvation, disease spreding - ***all human traditions** - and people value those violent traditions. Children parented to value violence, artificial itenlligence trained to value violence. Technology of spreading death in a crowded Earth still likes this one-line Twitter-logic of kill or be killed (sucide and take some with you, murder suicide paring). ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users could be organizing sending thousands of inexpensive smartphoens with SD cards to haeve *everyday people* record video of events and have multiple people show what is happening. In an information war - document how people are starving and being bombed.

This has been going on since October 2023 and social media society is not organizing to show thousands of indepenent *non-professional* people given a democratic voice in the situation. People are not asserting Malala's excellent ideas about terrorism on social media. Instead, people react to Israel over and over and over, reactionary thinking. Anti-progress thinking.

"The consequences are they lost their moral high ground forever now. Every time going forward there's a 'oh the holocaust' people will parallel it to what Israel is doping in Gaza. People are realising this has been going on, to a lesser extent than today, but for the last 70 years.

From what they are doing now Israel will lose a bunch of global support, possibly even USA over time. While they enjoy a powerful position in ME today, without big brother to arm and defend them things could really change over the longer term.

From that even with ethics and humanitarian reasons aside, this has been a horrible decision by Netanyahu, They get a little more land but the people will always be on the other side of the fence and now their global support will shrink."

"Ah, it’s hard to know, but yeah, women tend to be very vindictive and often don’t show the same level of comradery as male teams.

For me, I remember that if anything like that happened, you were expected to confront the person as a team, and if there was a scuffle, the whole team had to be involved. That’s how we were trained. Never allow the other team to bully you, but also never be the aggressor.

Antagonizing is appreciated tho... so it's a thin line.

With all that said, intentionally targeting the setter during warm-up is literally the biggest sin you can commit in volleyball, and it usually culminates in scuffles or fights.

You would always get punished for losing your temper, but you would be punished even more if you dont have your teammate's back.

At my level this would likely mean a DQ for the other team or red card for the player who did this.

You simply cannot do it, because you can concuss them. Volleyball can do real damage, and when you strike at average speeds above 100 km/h, you don’t get a chance to react. It feels like a sucker punch and can eliminate you from the game.

It always interests me that this stuff happens in the NBA or Volleyball, and the difference in reactions between men and women is very apparent. I’m assuming it has a lot to do with coaching culture."

"I've got a theory that some people think being smart is just being contrarian, like just claiming the opposite all the time. I think this might be because they get corrected by smarter people a lot, so that's their perception. To them, being smart isn't about actually being factually correct, it's just saying "nuh uh" and "akschully".

Also, I think there is a lot of past propaganda, like hard decisions have to be made, these few people must die so more can live, etc. But it's all purely reactionary, the thought ending random claim. Like American marketing had convinced the populace that there's always two sides of the truth, but you know, sometimes one side is Nazis and just objectively wrong."

"This is 100% it. And it’s why we’re fucked because they have trained themselves to never agree with anyone, especially people they do not like.

US culture has largely propagated this phenomenon due to how “cool”, “smart” or “manly” characters are portrayed in art and film. They’re usually witty and clever, and will verbally eviscerate anyone that dares challenge their morality or intellect, usually in a flashy or humorous way.

All these idiots are trying to be Deadpool or the Joker but they forget that requires actual charisma, humor, and intelligence. Because if you don’t have those you just come off as an over-confident brainless douche.

I’ve heard a lot of terms for these type of people like “know it alls” or “one-uppers” but I just call them assholes because all they do is spew shit at people and act shitty to everyone. Just shit people all around."

Like, the US (probably) isn't going to be permanently collapsed or permanently balkanized or something, but I suspect that other countries will never work as close with the US, never connect their militaries and economies as closely, and all of that adds up.

We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do.

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"It's clear there has been a generational misunderstanding of what ‘conservatism’ is, and it’s because conservatives have been allowed to define themselves with this bait and switch where they have convinced people ‘real’ conservatism is about fiscal responsibility, constitutional reverence, free markets or ‘being cautious’. Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.

Conservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order**. That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.

They like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order.

"I think you might be getting your hopes up a bit too much. American Fascism won't die with Trump. The same people who are killing America today will still have the same power structures in place; they still have tens of millions of people, including your MAGA neighbours, whose entire life is consumed by Trumpian cruelty and violence, and who wouldn't think twice about sending you to a death camp. Yes, some cults die with their founders, but this one is putting the structures into place at this very moment so that this doesn't happen. Scientology didn't die with Hubbard. The North Korean regime is flourishing as much as ever under its third Kim. Yes, Kim-Jong Un doesn't have the charisma or leadership skills that his grandfather and father had, but he doesn't have to - because Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il made sure to put the structures into place for their regime to go on indefinitely, or at least until they have killed every last North Korean citizen.

Right now Hegseth is replacing top generals with fascist leaders, right now the new ICE Gestapo is flush with $170 billion to put you under the yoke of the regime, right now troops are being moved into your cities, right now there are armed checkpoints in your nation's capital to control the movement of citizens, right now the media is being threatened into full government compliance, right now your elections are being rendered meaningless, right now the jackbooted thugs of the regime are doing raids of citizens' homes to put fear into them. All of that will continue and get worse whether Trump is there or not. If anything, the violence and the cruelty will get stepped up a notch upon his departure, while the new regime makes sure to maintain its stranglehold on the flimsy remains of American democracy.

The window of opportunity for fighting back is right now, and it's closing rapidly. There is zero chance that you will have meaningful midterm elections next year if you let this rotten filth fester any further, Trump or no Trump. There is zero chance that the bubble will burst on its own or that you get saved by a deus ex machina ending. Putting your hopes into the fact that Trump is a demented imbecile with rapidly declining health is a dangerous and ultimately fruitless gamble."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  The Twitter-think addiction to fiction isn't going away just because Donald Trump disappears. The aftermath of Cambridge Analytica psychologists isn't going away without being addressed directly. Goodness isn't going to randomly come up with a change of the season, people have to stop being addicted to enertainment trash and actually do thinking. Whcih at this point,everyone is flocking to artificial intelligence and people will fall for The ELIZA effect and believe nonsense is smarter. Nonsense fiction addiction already rules. I already know people are repulsed by my basic assertions that [democracy does not work without love and compassion being foundation - and MLK Jr's 1954 Equation](Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md). Alas, minds are so broken - asserting the most fundamental joys are important. Love is worth fighting for. **Hate is not worth fighting for and handing down hate to children**. ===:::

"Because their dictator will make the *others* suffer. They've been attacked for just being good god-fearing patriots, forced to be subjected to \*checks notes\* the WOKE liberals, and their "agendas".

I know for a fact if I were to post this one to Facebook, I'd probably have a couple of extended family members make disgusting comments on how funny it all is, even though back then they were bitching about Obama's Djion mustard, and whining about "Sleepy Joe Biden 😪". I'm so sick and tired of the faux rage and victimhood of the MAGA reight while they actively spread their hate and try to ruin the lives of people just trying to exist."

"Americans will see shit like this, they will see these weirdos posing in family Christmas photos with AR-15s, they will see January 6th, and all of the violent rioters get a presidential pardon, they will see the president order active duty military into our streets, they will see Republicans erect a concentration camp and people posing beside an "Alligator Alcatraz" sign, and then call the Democratic Party radical and extreme.

The asymmetry in American politics is insane. Democrats are expected to behave like statesmen, and make no mistakes. Meanwhile, a crazy right-winger literally assassinated high-ranking Democrats in America this year. Another crazy right-winger shot up the CDC, and the president didn't even acknowledge either incident."

"My coworker consumes Fox News. She can’t think. I know it’s redundant. But let me explain, there was an attack on our city by a guy and she said it was “illegal immigrants”, I chimed in and said he was an American and military. Never mind his background, she just repeated Fox News. I even asked WTF does immigration have to do with a military soldier committing an act of violence? He’s American. crickets.

I knew faux news was bullshit when I was 14! I can’t believe 50 year olds walk around like the people from WallE and can’t think for themselves."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  People in USA do not see it as their civic duty to address the intellectual problems. Adults do not learn in rectangle classrooms. Adults learn from rectangle HDTV screens, Fox News, and rectangle social machines, Reddit and Twitter and Bluesky, etc. In 1985, Neil Postman published a book about Ronald Regan's second term in office - and entertainment-faith President fron Hollywood, California. The book is titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death", and social media society should be putting sustained effort into making the concepts in that book understood and recognize - cultivating self-awareness of the Donald Trump problems of comprehension / understanding being grounded in media ecology. Also, social media has ignored that baby boomer Jen Senko stood up and made a film about Fox News that went into widespread release March 2016 (before the November 2016 election). People on social media are not asserting sustained repeating and focus on critical topics. Social media addicts are complaining about Fox News addicts and not addressing it with serious sustained alarm bells: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad ===:::

"Because you've thought way, way more about your position and are rallied up and ready to defend it with some actual evidence.

These people just don't ever think that much, the important looking guy and blonde woman on the TV tell them what to think and they just run with it. When actually challenged the resort to those tactics to be able to call the talk a "tie".

Watch out because whenever that happens they always come back a day or 2 later after studying Fox and Prager ready to dumps some fresh brain diarrhea on you."

Why not RESCUE the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from adults who do not grasp satire by using Reddit and Bluesky to TEACH LESSONS on satire?

Civic duty calls for ALL PEOPLE to stand up and RESCUE with teaching. The people with free time and spare time on social machines keep describing the same problems but are not rescuing those manipulated and attacked by the Internet Research Agency since March 2013.

"Yes. Fox hosts were proven to be systematically lying to their viewers through their own texts and private communications, sometimes at the direction of the producers, and they didn't lose any viewers. It's as if it never even happened."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction outsells nonfiction. Fiction is far more popular than nonfiction. ===:::

"If you had critical thinking skills you wouldn't be watching Fox News and believing it. Cults gonna cult. I honestly believe about half of humans lack the ability to decently reason or problem solve and I am not sure how much of that is just from education or that their brains are just not that developed on a genetic level. I have seen too many professionals that are functional enough to hold down a $80,000+ job and do it well but if you move the conversation out of their expertise will say the dumbest shit possible.

Critical thinking and straight logic should be taught in middle school and high school but the right is actively preventing that except for private schools."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People have been socialized in USA to value these unique one-off comments on Reddit. Millions of them being created constantly, all the time, people creating comments. Original writing, oritinal thinking. Donald Trump communicates constatnly in original ways on social media and electric media systems. But *originality* is overrated. Tony Clifton performances are original in that few politicians are willing to do what Donald Trump is doing adapting Tony Clifton acts to the White House. But what we need more than ever is to face up that the *source* of our information, Fox News / Truth Social / Reddit filter-bubble is the problem. Why are we not all, the entire 8 billion people in the world, focused on a *best practices* of thinking and having a Super Wikipedia system? And when someone has an idea - we link it - until we ALL GET on the SAME PAGES of ideas and stop re-inventing broken wheels? In the aftermath of the March 2013 onward Internet Research Agency addicton to fiction, a focus on nonficiton for everyone - public domain (no fee, no paywall) common set of goodness. We all have a body, why sin't medical knowledge being made public domain and open on the Internet - why are we not trying to drive down cost of medical cost and curing cancer - we all have a common interest in lost people / our neighbors and family - the *incentive* is compassion and love. If we ant a better world, we need to be taking the lessons of Fox News experience and applying it towards the future. We aren't learning from our mistakes. 1985 book by Neil Postman "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is a starting point, only 184 pages, for everyone to focus on the Donald Trump meme addiction crisis. How we hae LOL LOL LOL LMAO at entertainment Reality TV ("The Apprentice") trash learning too much, the Tony Clifton act of Trump and Putin has driven us into bewildered and confused states of minds. ===:::

People saying this on Reddit in August 2025 don't even recognize that Donald Trump is playing Tony Clifton, the answer of *more satire* to Tony Clifton peformance is a complete failure to grasp the situation at hand (since March 2013).

Surkov governing is based on this deepest exploit of the human mind. ===:::
