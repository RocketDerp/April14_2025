"It's shocking how quickly the US turned into Russia and it's even more shocking how their own people are cheering for it"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica deployed hard-core mental manipulation starting in March 2013. Several years before the November 2016 election win by Donald Trump. People do not take seriously the behavior changes in USA population. Terse, flippant, dismissive, avoidant of nonfiction. Donald Trump entertainer is valued above nonfiction sincere leaders. People compulsively spend all their free time and spare time insulting, mocking, name-calling, mimicking Donald Trump. Attracted to the total mockery unlike any other area of life. Donald Trump is bigger than all the top 10 video games, all the top 10 films, all the top ten sports events COMBINED in how much people can not resist mocking and insulting the Tony Clifton performance of Donald Trump. People do not want to face up how Saudi Arabia and Mecca operate, how Putin and Surkov use antics politics in Russia, etc. Motivating a population to murder neighbors in Ukraine is no small feat. Being a killer, blood on your hands, is no minor life experience. Russia has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014 and the people of Russia are so programmed and conditioned that it keeps going on and on. USA people have been more and more attracted to, flocking to, self-harm and dehumanization with Trump. The behaviors are in your face. People will not stop mocking, insulting, name-calling,dehumanizing "the others" in USA. Every day, the same attractions. ====:::

"So coverage here in Denmark, is that DR (danish national media) has uncovered a plot with 3 individuals with close ties to Trump, operating in Greenland trying to create false narratives, that would hurt the Greenlandic relationship with Denmark, with the goal of creating a Greenlandic “independence movement” in support of Trump taking over.

It violates several international laws, and will probably hurt ties between Denmark and the US further, unfortunately."

"
> I have no idea why so much of the MAGA-sphere thinks you win arguments by being louder.

It's not about winning arguments. They just want to shut down the opposition so they effectively give up. If you look at US politics right now, it seems to work, too. How many times have you rolled your eyes at something the president did or said in the last DAY and just not engaged because you knew exactly how the conversation would go anyway. I won't pretend I haven't been there."

"Do you know what the hardest thing is though? How fucking exhausting it is. If you have a shred of integrity you'll want to provide evidence for your arguments or takedowns. Rebuffing a single talking point can take hours of research, then more time to digest it and form a cohesive argument. So much time and effort, doing their research for them, and it's exhausting.

These chucklefucks though? They're not burdened with facts or reason. They just stroll in, confidently shout a load of bullshit that feels good or feels right to them, some shit they read on Twitter, then just dip. And people eat that shit up. It's not a level playing field, and the more insidious amongst them know it."

"I'd say that's fair, but lets not pretend like folks here do anything but regurgitate the same talking points."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Original thinking is far overrated. People flock to trending and jump on board bandwagons constantly. The problem is WHAT they flock to. Instead of flocking to authentic goodness values like Malala's reformations of sexual relations in Pakistan, people flock to Donald Trump's anti-education anti-comprehension anti-empathy anti-goodness. People flock to fiction storytelling of Fox News and Donald Trump, not to science and talking points. Same with ChatGTP and GrokAI - the fiction "hallucinations" they produce is incredibly popular with consumers / audiences. People do not see, authentic sharing of factual reality. "Sleep Joe Biden" is not entertaining for audiences, trash Tony Clifton performances by Donald Trump and others ells far more. Sober Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" can't be faced by people addicted to antics politics and fiction. People flock to entertainment, amusement, often LOL LOL LOL at the suffering of other people. Death-wishing draw an audience. The what people repeat is unoriginal and hate-filled. ===:::

"In my experience as a teacher, one of the biggest red flags that someone is going to have a hard time in life is that they struggle to understand analogies, satire, hypotheticals, thought experiments, etc... They simply do not have the capacity to link concepts in any kind of abstract way, or be able to compare and contrast them. Everything is engaged at the most basic straightforward level without any reflection.

A staggeringly large percentage of society lacks this ability."

"Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966. Every person must be able to distinguish fiction from nonfiction, metaphor from fact. ChatGPT / GrokAI and other LLM systems will spin creative fiction that people will treat as nonfiction...

"Well you also gotta remember how much sanewashing conservative media does of Trump. Most of these folks have never seen anything except curated excerpts of his speeches, or screenshots of his "good" (ie: less insane) Tweets on Facebook. Hopefully this actually has people not just look at themselves, but actually look at Trump outside of the small bubble that's been constructed around them.

Side note: I will never stop calling it Twitter, but what even is the new name for a "Tweet" if the channel is branded as "X"? "X posts"? "X'es"?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Media specific to a political party, media built around Fox News fiction storytelling, Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" fiction entertainment patterns is toxic to society in total. Neil Postman in 1985 published a book titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about this style of media techniques.
“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 ===:::

"One of Trump's first public displays on his 2016 campaign trail was him blatantly mocking a disabled reporter in mannerisms & speech. They all know bullying so well it comes second nature to them.

I believe that's partly to blame for their blinders here - they truly don't believe "the left" would mock & belittle somebody like that, so they take Newsome at face value.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in **the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming**, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995 ===:::

He's laid off thousands of federal workers, all over the nation, which not only means workers that will be unemployed BUT also cripples the government's ability to function AND the benefits the public gets from the government. His tariffs have pushed suppliers and nations away from the US who will have little reason to return-again, stability-and now will have worser trade deals.

"I am just an armchair economist watching things unfold and I think this recession could be the big one, possibly so damaging and prolonged that it actually upends the US as the global economic leader and hands the mantle to China.

Everyone knows there is a recession every 10-15 years. Companies get too greedy, lie to inflate valuations, they cut jobs and expenses too much and the whole thing collapses.

This has become a fairly accepted cycle in the business world and on Wall St.

Whenever this would happen the adults would step in, create some regulations and let things slowly rebuild.

The problem is there are no more adults in the room. Trump is starting trade wars with historic allies and driving up the costs of all products for seemingly no gains. They have fired the stats people from the labor board because they didn't like the numbers (and would prefer to publish fake ones that make things seem great). They are beginning a wholesale assault on the Fed, the last bastion of sanity and hope for an economic recovery and will do eventually replace JPow with some talking head from TV that Trump likes but has no idea what they are doing.

There is a good chance that the US/Trump will lean towards the Turkish economic policy of inflation doesn't exist and if it did it will just balance itself out and that will cause a catastrophic spiral downwards"

May as well stop investigating airplaine crashes and making cars safer, because if you don't deal with the pscyological problems of human brains and artifical intelligence finding that violence is the answer - terrorism will become the outcome from human beings who already terrorize the air / water / animals of the Earth.

"Ah, it’s hard to know, but yeah, women tend to be very vindictive and often don’t show the same level of comradery as male teams.

For me, I remember that if anything like that happened, you were expected to confront the person as a team, and if there was a scuffle, the whole team had to be involved. That’s how we were trained. Never allow the other team to bully you, but also never be the aggressor.

Antagonizing is appreciated tho... so it's a thin line.

With all that said, intentionally targeting the setter during warm-up is literally the biggest sin you can commit in volleyball, and it usually culminates in scuffles or fights.

You would always get punished for losing your temper, but you would be punished even more if you dont have your teammate's back.

At my level this would likely mean a DQ for the other team or red card for the player who did this.

You simply cannot do it, because you can concuss them. Volleyball can do real damage, and when you strike at average speeds above 100 km/h, you don’t get a chance to react. It feels like a sucker punch and can eliminate you from the game.

It always interests me that this stuff happens in the NBA or Volleyball, and the difference in reactions between men and women is very apparent. I’m assuming it has a lot to do with coaching culture."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Every time MAGA or Donald Trump has a ***BREAKING NEWS*** notification, media addicts in the United States Of America go home to caress their touchscreen and feel the warmth of the device in their handds as they react-comment how much they hate American people they disagree with. As long as the system keeps deliveirng Trump content. Instead of learning and teaching how Russian information warfare works, twitter-thinking short-idea message addicts create trash social media comment messages with their free time and spare time FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND TWO MONTHS since Donald Trump became the center of all attention every minute of every day. Mocking and insulting and name-calling just like Trump, behaving like Trump, turning the entire nation into a total mockery. ===:::

"The thing is, the stories they cover are still framed quite favorable for him, all things considered. Always sanewashing his bullshit and giving the benefit of the doubt. They don't talk at all as much as they should about the plethora of constitutional and rights violations the administration is committing. They aren't showing the true horrors unless the public is already overwhelmingly talking about them. They aren't doing anything to keep the public informed really. The even carefully chose their camera angles to make mass protests seem like little get togethers.together.

All of corporate media really downplay how much he if screwing us. Litterally killing our country, but they all seem to stick to a chosen set of authorized talking points. Corporations want him in office. Yes even the "liberal media" corporations. Corporations don't give a damn about your country, and your constitution and rights are just things that get in their way.

What we are told are "liberal" corporate news outlets serve only as a feeding tube to guide naratives of more passive news consumers so the conversation doesn't stray to far from what billionaired are comfortable with.

"To me one of the most chilling parts of 1984, and one that to me explains a lot of the conservative/authoritarian mindset, is when O'Brien explains to Smith that making someone else suffer is the only way to make sure you have power over them: after all, how can you know you are imposing your will on someone else if they just comply? For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them. That is the point of cruelty for its own sake as weaponized by conservatives ans authoritarians."

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to **instill chaos through society** so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ... ... ...

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes, **the plan, the plot to break America** was spelled out in a 2019 book, way back in year 2019:
“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. **year 2019** ... alas, social meme addicts can't be bothered to stay focused on a printed book on paper and instead revel in the never-ending mockery of Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton. ===:::

"It's clear there has been a generational misunderstanding of what ‘conservatism’ is, and it’s because conservatives have been allowed to define themselves with this bait and switch where they have convinced people ‘real’ conservatism is about fiscal responsibility, constitutional reverence, free markets or ‘being cautious’. Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.

Conservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order**. That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.

They like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order. Once you understand this all their bullshit makes sense."

"I think you might be getting your hopes up a bit too much. American Fascism won't die with Trump. The same people who are killing America today will still have the same power structures in place; they still have tens of millions of people, including your MAGA neighbours, whose entire life is consumed by Trumpian cruelty and violence, and who wouldn't think twice about sending you to a death camp. Yes, some cults die with their founders, but this one is putting the structures into place at this very moment so that this doesn't happen. Scientology didn't die with Hubbard. The North Korean regime is flourishing as much as ever under its third Kim. Yes, Kim-Jong Un doesn't have the charisma or leadership skills that his grandfather and father had, but he doesn't have to - because Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il made sure to put the structures into place for their regime to go on indefinitely, or at least until they have killed every last North Korean citizen.

Right now Hegseth is replacing top generals with fascist leaders, right now the new ICE Gestapo is flush with $170 billion to put you under the yoke of the regime, right now troops are being moved into your cities, right now there are armed checkpoints in your nation's capital to control the movement of citizens, right now the media is being threatened into full government compliance, right now your elections are being rendered meaningless, right now the jackbooted thugs of the regime are doing raids of citizens' homes to put fear into them. All of that will continue and get worse whether Trump is there or not. If anything, the violence and the cruelty will get stepped up a notch upon his departure, while the new regime makes sure to maintain its stranglehold on the flimsy remains of American democracy.

The window of opportunity for fighting back is right now, and it's closing rapidly. There is zero chance that you will have meaningful midterm elections next year if you let this rotten filth fester any further, Trump or no Trump. There is zero chance that the bubble will burst on its own or that you get saved by a deus ex machina ending. Putting your hopes into the fact that Trump is a demented imbecile with rapidly declining health is a dangerous and ultimately fruitless gamble."

"It’s amazing it’s taken Democrats this long to learn how to rankle the most egotistical narcissist in politics. Nearly ten years! This was always the way."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media addicts, people addicted to memes, always crave more and ore and more memes and junk tarsh media. Always cheering on creation of more trash content and not wanting to face nonfiction about media addiction and information warfare. Surkov won, Russia won, since March 2013. More than 10 years. People saying this on Reddit in August 2025 don't even recognize that Donald Trump is playing Tony Clifton, the answer of *more satire* to Tony Clifton peformance is a complete failure to grasp the situation at hand (since March 2013). This is Surkov governing that has worked for Putin for 25 years! People can't even recognize it. Mocking is not resisting, mocking Tony Clifton is exactly the intended outcome of the performance. Surkov governing is based on this deepest exploit of the human mind. ===:::
