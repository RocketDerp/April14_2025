"No, they are connected to how many people were killed that were working for western organizations. Last time there was an apology was the WCK bombing. Now the journalists that were killed were working for western publications."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media users could be organizing sending thousands of inexpensive smartphoens with SD cards to haeve *everyday people* record video of events and have multiple people show what is happening. In an information war - document how people are starving and being bombed. Organize pickup locations for SD cards every 12 hours and a system to publish the videos from Amman Jordan or other neary by Internet stable location. This has been going on since October 2023 and social media society is not organizing to show thousands of indepenent *non-professional* people given a democratic voice in the situation. People are not asserting Malala's excellent ideas about terrorism on social media. Instead, people react to Israel over and over and over, reactionary thinking. Anti-progress thinking. Social media society has all the signs of beig media addicted to the daily news events and not actually haing copassion for EVERYDAY people being given voice like Malala's focus on EVERYDAY people being given voice through education and stable information systems (stable education / learning systems). ===:::

"The consequences are they lost their moral high ground forever now. Every time going forward there's a 'oh the holocaust' people will parallel it to what Israel is doping in Gaza. People are realising this has been going on, to a lesser extent than today, but for the last 70 years.

From what they are doing now Israel will lose a bunch of global support, possibly even USA over time. While they enjoy a powerful position in ME today, without big brother to arm and defend them things could really change over the longer term.

From that even with ethics and humanitarian reasons aside, this has been a horrible decision by Netanyahu, They get a little more land but the people will always be on the other side of the fence and now their global support will shrink."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think media addicts are entertained by horror films, wars footage, video of suffering, photographs of others suffering and being terrorized. Content creation is what many people favor over compassion and love. Addicts to media reacting to every event of war, not calling for Malala's **nonfiction** solutions to end war - but instead react-commenting on Reddit and other media platforms and media systems keeps audiences glued to streaming information devices. ==:::

So conditioned that violence solves problems. Domestic violence being encouraged constantly when we are dealing with media addiction problems.

Addiction to hate, horror, "The Purge" fiction, etc. Social media addicts keep repeating their cravings for horror content, nightmares, violence action films instead of addresing that MAGA is driven by systemic violence (D.O.G.E. dehumanization, USAid removal dehumanization, hate promotion, anti-empahty, anti-compassion). Addicts to media don't want to teach about media ecology and media addiction and address the Russian information warfare since March 2013. Craving for violence and action images abounds. ===:::

"The cratering of the economy is intentional. When the smaller businesses go belly-up they will be bought out for pennies on the dollar by larger corporations which will charge higher rates for shittier service and then blame woke or DEI for the business failing. But they will simply declare bankruptcy and move on to the next. The US is entering the second Gilded Age. It will be probably 20-30 years before it recovers, if it ever does. Multiple generations will be lost to indentured servitude to corporations. But the leaders will lie and the corporate media will lap at those lies and spread them breathlessly to stay in the good graces of the Führer. Truth is lost. Facts mean nothing."

"Ah, it’s hard to know, but yeah, women tend to be very vindictive and often don’t show the same level of comradery as male teams.

For me, I remember that if anything like that happened, you were expected to confront the person as a team, and if there was a scuffle, the whole team had to be involved. That’s how we were trained. Never allow the other team to bully you, but also never be the aggressor.

Antagonizing is appreciated tho... so it's a thin line.

With all that said, intentionally targeting the setter during warm-up is literally the biggest sin you can commit in volleyball, and it usually culminates in scuffles or fights.

You would always get punished for losing your temper, but you would be punished even more if you dont have your teammate's back.

At my level this would likely mean a DQ for the other team or red card for the player who did this.

You simply cannot do it, because you can concuss them. Volleyball can do real damage, and when you strike at average speeds above 100 km/h, you don’t get a chance to react. It feels like a sucker punch and can eliminate you from the game.

It always interests me that this stuff happens in the NBA or Volleyball, and the difference in reactions between men and women is very apparent. I’m assuming it has a lot to do with coaching culture."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : military training techniques work on Japanese in 1942, Germans in 1942, Russians in 1942.

Gender lines of out-group hate, rape and pillage, are part of military practices all over the world in 1940's techniques. The attraction to Putin and Trump is attraction to mass dehumanization and out-group mockery. Meme addicts can't resist the total mockery Putin and Trump created since March 2013 using information systems warfare. ===:::

"I've got a theory that some people think being smart is just being contrarian, like just claiming the opposite all the time. I think this might be because they get corrected by smarter people a lot, so that's their perception. To them, being smart isn't about actually being factually correct, it's just saying "nuh uh" and "akschully".

Also, I think there is a lot of past propaganda, like hard decisions have to be made, these few people must die so more can live, etc. But it's all purely reactionary, the thought ending random claim.

"This is 100% it. And it’s why we’re fucked because they have trained themselves to never agree with anyone, especially people they do not like.

US culture has largely propagated this phenomenon due to how “cool”, “smart” or “manly” characters are portrayed in art and film. They’re usually witty and clever, and will verbally eviscerate anyone that dares challenge their morality or intellect, usually in a flashy or humorous way.

All these idiots are trying to be Deadpool or the Joker but they forget that requires actual charisma, humor, and intelligence. Because if you don’t have those you just come off as an over-confident brainless douche.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : “a peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again. It is an improbable world. It is a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. **The aim is not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies**. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will lead to a better life, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture consuming itself with information, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.”

For all you know they are just faking compliance. But if you make them suffer and break them, O'Brien explains, then you know you are imposing your will on them and exert power over them.

Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty.

And it should be a much bigger deal that Trump plainly has no idea what “his” executive orders actually say. If you can endure listening to him in this video, he seems to think that he’s actually creating a new criminal statute unilaterally; even if the goal wasn’t to punish protected speech, that is effing nuts."

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"It's clear there has been a generational misunderstanding of what ‘conservatism’ is, and it’s because conservatives have been allowed to define themselves with this bait and switch where they have convinced people ‘real’ conservatism is about fiscal responsibility, constitutional reverence, free markets or ‘being cautious’. Nope, those were always just a means to the end, once those stop working conservatives will adapt other means.

Conservatism is about preserving past social orders. **It’s not so much a ‘principled stand on government or economic mechanisms’ but a stand on who controls the social order**. That's what they are trying to conserve. If they think they can no longer keep the ‘proper societal hierarchy’ though those means, if ‘those lower than them’ get out of place they have no problem changing the means. Their only ‘principle’ is a society with the ‘right people’ on top and everything else is fungible to that goal.

They like democracy when democracy produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like ’free markets’ when that market produces a society where the ‘right’ people are on top, they like 'judicial restraint' when it fails to protect those not on the top, but when that changes conservatives have no problem dropping democracy/unregulated capitalism or judicial precedent to keep the social order. Once you understand this all their bullshit makes sense."

"I think you might be getting your hopes up a bit too much. American Fascism won't die with Trump. The same people who are killing America today will still have the same power structures in place; they still have tens of millions of people, including your MAGA neighbours, whose entire life is consumed by Trumpian cruelty and violence, and who wouldn't think twice about sending you to a death camp. Yes, some cults die with their founders, but this one is putting the structures into place at this very moment so that this doesn't happen. Scientology didn't die with Hubbard. The North Korean regime is flourishing as much as ever under its third Kim. Yes, Kim-Jong Un doesn't have the charisma or leadership skills that his grandfather and father had, but he doesn't have to - because Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il made sure to put the structures into place for their regime to go on indefinitely, or at least until they have killed every last North Korean citizen.

Right now Hegseth is replacing top generals with fascist leaders, right now the new ICE Gestapo is flush with $170 billion to put you under the yoke of the regime, right now troops are being moved into your cities, right now there are armed checkpoints in your nation's capital to control the movement of citizens, right now the media is being threatened into full government compliance, right now your elections are being rendered meaningless, right now the jackbooted thugs of the regime are doing raids of citizens' homes to put fear into them. All of that will continue and get worse whether Trump is there or not. If anything, the violence and the cruelty will get stepped up a notch upon his departure, while the new regime makes sure to maintain its stranglehold on the flimsy remains of American democracy.

The window of opportunity for fighting back is right now, and it's closing rapidly. There is zero chance that you will have meaningful midterm elections next year if you let this rotten filth fester any further, Trump or no Trump. There is zero chance that the bubble will burst on its own or that you get saved by a deus ex machina ending. Putting your hopes into the fact that Trump is a demented imbecile with rapidly declining health is a dangerous and ultimately fruitless gamble."

"My coworker consumes Fox News. She can’t think. I know it’s redundant. But let me explain, there was an attack on our city by a guy and she said it was “illegal immigrants”, I chimed in and said he was an American and military. Never mind his background, she just repeated Fox News. I even asked WTF does immigration have to do with a military soldier committing an act of violence? He’s American. crickets.

I knew faux news was bullshit when I was 14! I can’t believe 50 year olds walk around like the people from WallE and can’t think for themselves."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  People in USA do not see it as their civic duty to address the intellectual problems. Adults do not learn in rectangle classrooms. Adults learn from rectangle HDTV screens, Fox News, and rectangle social machines, Reddit and Twitter and Bluesky, etc. In 1985, Neil Postman published a book about Ronald Regan's second term in office - and entertainment-faith President fron Hollywood, California. The book is titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death", and social media society should be putting sustained effort into making the concepts in that book understood and recognize - cultivating self-awareness of the Donald Trump problems of comprehension / understanding being grounded in media ecology. Also, social media has ignored that baby boomer Jen Senko stood up and made a film about Fox News that went into widespread release March 2016 (before the November 2016 election). People on social media are not asserting sustained repeating and focus on critical topics. Social media addicts are complaining about Fox News addicts and not addressing it with serious sustained alarm bells: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad ===:::

"Because you've thought way, way more about your position and are rallied up and ready to defend it with some actual evidence.

These people just don't ever think that much, the important looking guy and blonde woman on the TV tell them what to think and they just run with it. When actually challenged the resort to those tactics to be able to call the talk a "tie".

Watch out because whenever that happens they always come back a day or 2 later after studying Fox and Prager ready to dumps some fresh brain diarrhea on you."

"Conservatives have trouble comprehending satire. Many of them thought the Colbert Report was legit."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Twitter-length Bluesky-think message. Tiny short deceleration of problem without any concern to address it. Why not RESCUE the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from adults who do not grasp satire by using Reddit and Bluesky to TEACH LESSONS on satire? People are so engaged in the Donald Trump Tony Clifton satire performances, that they don't see any need to address the education and comprehension directly. Civic duty calls for ALL PEOPLE to stand up and RESCUE with teaching. The people with free time and spare time on social machines keep describing the same problems but are not rescuing those manipulated and attacked by the Internet Research Agency since March 2013. Surkov won. ===:::

"Yes. Fox hosts were proven to be systematically lying to their viewers through their own texts and private communications, sometimes at the direction of the producers, and they didn't lose any viewers. It's as if it never even happened."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Fiction outsells nonfiction. Fiction is far more popular than nonfiction. ===:::

&nbsp;

"If you had critical thinking skills you wouldn't be watching Fox News and believing it. Cults gonna cult. I honestly believe about half of humans lack the ability to decently reason or problem solve and I am not sure how much of that is just from education or that their brains are just not that developed on a genetic level. I have seen too many professionals that are functional enough to hold down a $80,000+ job and do it well but if you move the conversation out of their expertise will say the dumbest shit possible.

Critical thinking and straight logic should be taught in middle school and high school but the right is actively preventing that except for private schools."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People have been socialized in USA to value these unique one-off comments on Reddit. Millions of them being created constantly, all the time, people creating comments. Original writing, oritinal thinking. Donald Trump communicates constatnly in original ways on social media and electric media systems. But *originality* is overrated. Tony Clifton performances are original in that few politicians are willing to do what Donald Trump is doing adapting Tony Clifton acts to the White House. But what we need more than ever is to face up that the *source* of our information, Fox News / Truth Social / Reddit filter-bubble is the problem. Why are we not all, the entire 8 billion people in the world, focused on a *best practices* of thinking and having a Super Wikipedia system? And when someone has an idea - we link it - until we ALL GET on the SAME PAGES of ideas and stop re-inventing broken wheels? In the aftermath of the March 2013 onward Internet Research Agency addicton to fiction, a focus on nonficiton for everyone - public domain (no fee, no paywall) common set of goodness. We all have a body, why sin't medical knowledge being made public domain and open on the Internet - why are we not trying to drive down cost of medical cost and curing cancer - we all have a common interest in lost people / our neighbors and family - the *incentive* is compassion and love. If we ant a better world, we need to be taking the lessons of Fox News experience and applying it towards the future. We aren't learning from our mistakes. 1985 book by Neil Postman "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is a starting point, only 184 pages, for everyone to focus on the Donald Trump meme addiction crisis. How we hae LOL LOL LOL LMAO at entertainment Reality TV ("The Apprentice") trash learning too much, the Tony Clifton act of Trump and Putin has driven us into bewildered and confused states of minds. ===:::

"That's the danger of satire. The better it is, the less likely the people being satirised will understand it."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : That is how Surkov won! Surkov students since March 2013 waged a war of weaponized satire. https://old.reddit.com/r/WarAll/comments/1msqs1t/war_of_all_against_all_since_march_2013_war/ ===:::

"It’s amazing it’s taken Democrats this long to learn how to rankle the most egotistical narcissist in politics. Nearly ten years! This was always the way."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Social media addicts, people addicted to memes, always crave more and ore and more memes and junk tarsh media. Always cheering on creation of more trash content and not wanting to face nonfiction about media addiction and information warfare. Surkov won, Russia won, since March 2013. More than 10 years. People saying this on Reddit in August 2025 don't even recognize that Donald Trump is playing Tony Clifton, the answer of *more satire* to Tony Clifton peformance is a complete failure to grasp the situation at hand (since March 2013). This is Surkov governing that has worked for Putin for 25 years! People can't even recognize it. Mocking is not resisting, mocking Tony Clifton is exactly the intended outcome of the performance. Surkov governing is based on this deepest exploit of the human mind. ===:::
