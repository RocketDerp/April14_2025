"All of this stems at least in part from the rise of anti-intellectualism in the US. Too many people have been coddled into a society where how you "feel" about reality and what you "want" to believe is validated and given equal weight to objectivity.

So we've got people voting for leaders who say the things that confirm their feelings rather than the truth. We're all about to find out what happens when you run an economy on vibes alone."

"I think the bigger thing that many are missing is internet misinformation posts that farm said feelings. Before the lies and misinformation were maybe just a news paper or the local crazy.

But now the misinformation is online and on at everyones fingertips 24/7 and 365 days a year. On apps and websites that mentally encourage users to keep coming back over and over again. With apps and videos that decrease attention spans and are addictive so you keep coming back.

The people that post these videos too can make whole careers out of and if they get big enough, they can have a whole career and internet fame and podcast ect. So they are encouraged to keep posting and putting out more and more content and fake theories.

Plus there word and misinformation can get spread around in secounds once they hit upload. Then onto of that they now have politicians that are willing to dip so low as to spread their word and bullshit on the political stage.

Then on top of that researching now is hard for many. Many dont know how to do it (as many dont even know how to go looking for a proper trustworthy source) and even if they did the amount of time that it would take to researching every topic you see online, it would be extremely difficult and most people dont have that kind of time or energy to go look."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The idea that every person has to do "their own research" (famous phrase: "Do your own research crowd") is toxic. [Everything in society becomes a booby-trap](../../Important/Booby_Trapped_Reality.md). Honesty, sincerity, citation, source of information are essential to an information worker society / technology society. Donald Trump attracts people who flock to "sounds good" like Joe Rogan and Fox News and Elon Musk Twitter. Short-form social media was called out by Carl Sagan in 1995. ===:::

"Misinformation works as well as it does because these people want to hear this shit. Its not like misinformation is going: "green aliens control the government".

Misinformation from republicans are implemented ideas and thoughts that have been pushed for nearly 50 years now.

There are multiple interviews done with republican voters where the interviewer asks the voter what they want out of politics, then explains both republicans stance and democrats stance on those points, and even gets the voter to admit yes democrats would be better for them in both the short-term and long-term.

AND then the voter says he still cant vote for a democrat....

Its not like they dont like Trump's policies. They just dont like that its happening to them. They wanted it to happen to other people. They wanted to hurt other people. They just didnt think they themselves were in the "other" category.

If you can convince a group of people that another group of people are not as "human" as they are, they are more willing to accept and even demand harm to the other groups."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Long-form social media is good, except that in this case no author or book or expanded material is cited. Where did this person hear these ideas, who is their source and research on the subject. There has become a trend to behave like RFK Jr and Donald Trump and provide long-form information but not cite well researched authors or writings. People aren't encouraged to go to the public library and instead consume a page of information and move on to a completely different subject. Improtant topics drown in the constant context changes, the social media streaming memes and reactions to Donald Trump White House. Absent is asserts like this Reddit message saying: "We really need to make Neil Postman's 1985 book a household name and get everyone on the sae page of these topics. Malala in Pakistan also had a lot to say in her 2013 book about how the Taliban used Radio Mullah to influence poor people." - there is no rally point of common understanding. It is just a message that is in conversation and not treating this as one of the most iportant and serious topics of our time that has been gong on since March 2013 rise of MAGA and Donald Trump's constant society attention and focus. ===:::
