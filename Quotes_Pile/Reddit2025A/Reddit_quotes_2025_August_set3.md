"All of this stems at least in part from the rise of anti-intellectualism in the US. Too many people have been coddled into a society where how you "feel" about reality and what you "want" to believe is validated and given equal weight to objectivity.

So we've got people voting for leaders who say the things that confirm their feelings rather than the truth. We're all about to find out what happens when you run an economy on vibes alone."

"I think the bigger thing that many are missing is internet misinformation posts that farm said feelings. Before the lies and misinformation were maybe just a news paper or the local crazy.

But now the misinformation is online and on at everyones fingertips 24/7 and 365 days a year. On apps and websites that mentally encourage users to keep coming back over and over again. With apps and videos that decrease attention spans and are addictive so you keep coming back.

The people that post these videos too can make whole careers out of and if they get big enough, they can have a whole career and internet fame and podcast ect. So they are encouraged to keep posting and putting out more and more content and fake theories.

Plus there word and misinformation can get spread around in secounds once they hit upload. Then onto of that they now have politicians that are willing to dip so low as to spread their word and bullshit on the political stage.

Then on top of that researching now is hard for many. Many dont know how to do it (as many dont even know how to go looking for a proper trustworthy source) and even if they did the amount of time that it would take to researching every topic you see online, it would be extremely difficult and most people dont have that kind of time or energy to go look."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The idea that every person has to do "their own research" (famous phrase: "Do your own research crowd") is toxic. [Everything in society becomes a booby-trap](../../Important/Booby_Trapped_Reality.md). Honesty, sincerity, citation, source of information are essential to an information worker society / technology society. Donald Trump attracts people who flock to "sounds good" like Joe Rogan and Fox News and Elon Musk Twitter. Short-form social media was called out by Carl Sagan in 1995. ===:::

"Misinformation works as well as it does because these people want to hear this shit. Its not like misinformation is going: "green aliens control the government".

Misinformation from republicans are implemented ideas and thoughts that have been pushed for nearly 50 years now.

There are multiple interviews done with republican voters where the interviewer asks the voter what they want out of politics, then explains both republicans stance and democrats stance on those points, and even gets the voter to admit yes democrats would be better for them in both the short-term and long-term.

AND then the voter says he still cant vote for a democrat....

Its not like they dont like Trump's policies. They just dont like that its happening to them. They wanted it to happen to other people. They wanted to hurt other people. They just didnt think they themselves were in the "other" category.

If you can convince a group of people that another group of people are not as "human" as they are, they are more willing to accept and even demand harm to the other groups."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Long-form social media is good, except that in this case no author or book or expanded material is cited. Where did this person hear these ideas, who is their source and research on the subject. There has become a trend to behave like RFK Jr and Donald Trump and provide long-form information but not cite well researched authors or writings. People aren't encouraged to go to the public library and instead consume a page of information and move on to a completely different subject. Improtant topics drown in the constant context changes, the social media streaming memes and reactions to Donald Trump White House. Absent is asserts like this Reddit message saying: "We really need to make Neil Postman's 1985 book a household name and get everyone on the sae page of these topics. Malala in Pakistan also had a lot to say in her 2013 book about how the Taliban used Radio Mullah to influence poor people." - there is no rally point of common understanding. You witness all July 2025 / August 2025 (past 6 weeks) constant calls for "Epstein List", but you do not see such messaging of constant calls "We all need to read Neil Postman's 1985 book" to address the intellectual problems of society, that MAGA bleieves falsehoods and fiction.  It is just a message that is in conversation that will be ignored after it ages out in 48 hours... and not treating this problem as one of the most iportant and serious topics of our time that has been gong on since March 2013 rise of MAGA and Donald Trump's constant society attention and focus. ===:::

"Yeah, there’s this guy on TikTok called The Elder Millenial that literally just spouts off with multiple easily disproven bullshit right wing propaganda videos all day every day to the point where I’m pretty sure it’s his full time job now.

And even though the comments are usually calling out his lies, it doesn’t matter. He’ll leave the videos up even when he’s proven wrong because the engagement is all that matters. Lies or no lies—the guy has over half a million followers. For every one person who calls him out, ten more go “Yeah! You tell em! Stupid libs.”

Like… How do we even combat this? The truth doesn’t matter as long as it affirms the beliefs of whomever’s consuming it. These damn phones have broken our brains and I honestly don’t see any way out of it.

Not to mention, I was raised in the rural south and went to a backwoods podunk public school in a bottom five state in education rankings. And yet I was taught how to verify my sources. I was taught how to distinguish trusted information from opinion. How is it that so many other goddamn people have just completely forgot? Really makes my brain hurt."

"See I use to want to argue with some of these people but, one I know in real life proudly told me one of the "facts" he learned online from one of these creators.

That fact was that the big planes spreading "chem trails" only have enough fuel for take off and that they dont need any for mid flight or landing.

Completely blind to physics or math's.

Altbough i would say half want to affirm their beliefs I think to the other half it doesnt even matter if it affirms their beliefs. From what I know of some of these people they ALL have some dark hole in there life, be it a mental problem, money problems, health problems or shitty up bringing ect. And they all want to blame it on someone or take their frustration out on someone, some higher power and fantasy land.

All these people look to is some creator pumping them content and telling them how to feel, how to think and who to hate. With some sprinkles of hidden shady powers and evil people pulling the strings screwing them and everyone else over."

"they kinda told the truth, they will never care about "your" feelings cause you arent a real person like they are so their feelings matter, yours dont. its part of conservatives embracing of authoritarianism over the last 40 odd years, they wouldnt be trying to gerrymander if they believed in democracy."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  "its part of conservatives embracing of authoritarianism over the last 40 odd years" - 40 years ago is when Neil Postman's 1985 book about television media, electric media (social media) was created. Amusing / Entertaining ourselves to death. And it is a mistake to view "conservatives embracing of authoritarianism" as a recent trend, the entire stories of the Levant religions: Torah, Quran, Bible are all based on heavy authoritarianism teachings to children at the youngest age in Mosque, Church, Synagogue / parenting. All human history of Levant religions. [Study Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan year 2013](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/24987300-i-am-malala-the-girl-who-stood-up-for-education-and-was-shot-by-the-tal), which is VERY FAR from Mecca and Quran origins, as is California from Bible / Jesus storytelling origins. "conservatives embracing of authoritarianism" in Saudi Arabia has been ongoing for thousands of years! It is really only since world war two that USA society broke free of the Bible / Church fiction authoritarianism indoctrination. ["And the scientific game, after all, may not be any truer, but it is vaster, and it takes in a bigger range of facts and experience. So it is this terrific moment that we face; it is a moment that has been maturing so to say since the days of the Greeks. And since the days of the Second World War, it has gone through all the planet." - 1961](../Joseph_Campbell_Quotes.md) ... And by 1985 Neil Postman was describing the Fox News religion development before the 1996 opening of Fox News itself. "conservatives embracing of authoritarianism" - embrace of fiction storytelling over scintific reality. ===:::

"Idiots love authoritarianism.  Its warm and fuzzy to not have to think and to just  trust some authoritarian leader or religious teaching instead facing reality.  

 It also takes away self responsibility.  You can just be "following orders" or push it "must be god's will." "

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : it's more about self-awareness. Calling other people idiots with short-length Twitter-think messages is exactly what MAGA / Donald Trump encourages. Everyone in USA calling everyone else stupid idiots. It's has been the core thinking of out-group idiots for a decade, tree after tree of people calling others idiots without seeing the forest of March 2013 Russian media invasion. Surkov students and Cambridge Analytica have induced these feedback loops in social media society USA where constantly mocking has formed a total mockery society. Insulting and belittlement of the problems of education, comprehension, [filter-bubble media consumption](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15503719-the-filter-bubble-what-the-internet-is-hiding-from-you), etc dominates thinking as ideas scroll of the page and are not connected together as a forest-level problem while people react-comment on media machines to tree after tree of streaming memes and messages. ===:::
