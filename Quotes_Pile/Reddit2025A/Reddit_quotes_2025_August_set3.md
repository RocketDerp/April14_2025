"All of this stems at least in part from the rise of anti-intellectualism in the US. Too many people have been coddled into a society where how you "feel" about reality and what you "want" to believe is validated and given equal weight to objectivity.

So we've got people voting for leaders who say the things that confirm their feelings rather than the truth. We're all about to find out what happens when you run an economy on vibes alone."

"I think the bigger thing that many are missing is internet misinformation posts that farm said feelings. Before the lies and misinformation were maybe just a news paper or the local crazy.

But now the misinformation is online and on at everyones fingertips 24/7 and 365 days a year. On apps and websites that mentally encourage users to keep coming back over and over again. With apps and videos that decrease attention spans and are addictive so you keep coming back.

The people that post these videos too can make whole careers out of and if they get big enough, they can have a whole career and internet fame and podcast ect. So they are encouraged to keep posting and putting out more and more content and fake theories.

Plus there word and misinformation can get spread around in secounds once they hit upload. Then onto of that they now have politicians that are willing to dip so low as to spread their word and bullshit on the political stage.

Then on top of that researching now is hard for many. Many dont know how to do it (as many dont even know how to go looking for a proper trustworthy source) and even if they did the amount of time that it would take to researching every topic you see online, it would be extremely difficult and most people dont have that kind of time or energy to go look."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The idea that every person has to do "their own research" (famous phrase: "Do your own research crowd") is toxic. [Everything in society becomes a booby-trap](../../Important/Booby_Trapped_Reality.md). Honesty, sincerity, citation, source of information are essential to an information worker society / technology society. Donald Trump attracts people who flock to "sounds good" like Joe Rogan and Fox News and Elon Musk Twitter. Short-form social media was called out by Carl Sagan in 1995. ===:::
