In 1985, Neil Postman of NYU (Donald Trump's home city) [published a book about entertainment President Ronald Reagan's second term called "Amusing Ourselves To Death"](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/). How media audiences find it so funny and attractive when an absurd surreal status symbol leads then that they self-harm ("to death") their own nation and children's future out of attraction to shit entertainment. Enshitification on a national scale because of addiction to terrible Ronald Reagan 1985 second term methods of media engagement. ===:::

"The trouble with Trump is that he's prepared to keep up this onslaught every day, every week for the remainder of his natural life. He'll double down on any pushback with even more authoritarianism and illegal/unconstitutional means, from using federal agencies to harass any people in his way to actually rigging the entire political system so that his yes men are permanently running America.

And this is largely because he knows that without all of this, he and his family businesses are doomed the moment he leaves office. He is essentially bullying the entire world into submission, and all the powerful people currently forced to play nice while he's ordering them around won't be so forgiving when he no longer has the ability to back up his threats.

Vance doesn't have the same baggage or motivation, and more importantly he gets his advice from a different group of slightly less nasty people(The tech oligarchs like Musk aren't fans of the tariffs or the White House interfering in the day-to-day functioning of businesses and universities)."

"Unfortunately none of this stops with Trump. People still don’t get it. Trump is *THE* useful idiot. Emphasis on idiot! The Heritage Foundation is the actual head of this administration, which was the goal the whole time.

Trump can literally do whatever the fuck, say whatever the fuck, and act as horrible as he wants because all it does is distract from what his administration is actually doing. Trump is the Talking Head; the puppet."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : People for 10 years seem unable to describe Donald Trump behaving like Tony Clifton in his media audience interaction. People adore mocking and hate upon Trump, that's the Tonly Clifton act. Trump has an eye for the other end of the television set. Trump knows how to make the screen flicker and vertical sync, how to make it go out of focus. He knows how to get inside people's heads, under their skin, to be the center of attention as a hate magnet. Disco ball of egomania audience. Trump commands a fixation on Trump. Walking Talking *Infinite Jest* mind exploit. ===:::

"This is what people get wrong about Putin, he was confident in Russia’s capacity to take Ukraine in a week, almost everyone including Ukraine believed this to be true.  If he had been successful, it would have been a great geopolitical victory for Russia. 

Now Putin has failed and can’t get himself out of this mess without losing his head. This alone gives the US a massive advantage to not just clip Russia’s fangs but destroy their influence, however here comes Trump, the dumbo in chief , giving Putin everything he wanted and destroying America’s power along with it."


* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Except that BBC Adam Curtis on December 31, 2014 broadcast this: "It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year (2014). In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. **The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception**, in order to manage and control." - **year 2014** - denial of the IRA, denial of the Kremlin information warfare on Reddit. Just saying "Russian bots" does not in any way demosntrate self-awareness of Surkov techniques and the long-term thinking the Kremlin has demonstrated. On the flip side of social media, Surkov and Putin long-term year 2013 planning is the reason I emphaisze Malala so frequently. Same year 2013 timeline on world stage - and people on social media can't see her LONG-TERM plans of October 8, 2013 and how they interact with a decade-later October 7, 2023 Palestine terrorism. People are NOT taking "High Roads" on social media, they are not connecting the dots. Human beings are the source of love, compassion, goodness in the world - and if we don't CHOOSE with our FREE WILL to support and rally around goodness itself - leaders like Malala - and we continue to put leaders like Putin at the top of our governments... WE will be CHOOSING as people to have a shit world. Show me where social media has focused and sustained on Malala since year 2013? Show me where people grasp and understand the role Fox News has on audience, how EDUCATION and MEDIA CONSUMPTION (Fox News vs. Malala ideas) doesn't influence family and friends in USA. We are not facing up that our own brains are programmable. Malala in Pakistan is one of the few actually calling that out. All the while we are watching machine learning going on with ChatGPT and GrokAI - without focusing on the media we consume. Did Russia want to win the war qucker, perhaps, but they ALSO had concepts and ideas of using the Ukraine physical war as a platform for media manipulation - and they have DONE SO as Adam Curtis BBC spelled out December 31, 2014. ===:::

My longer form, more insightful comments get a few upvotes (occasionally a lot of downvotes if I wax philosophical on a controversial subject).

Point being, reddit and redditors seem to reward being an artificial human equivalent rather than a creative, random though generator that then follows those thoughts into new places.

"Following 9/11 - where the deaths were a much much smaller percentage of its total population - the US launched multiple wars that resulted in 4.5 *million* deaths (both direct and indirect) across Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen. The *vast* majority of the people who were old enough to have political opinions in 2002 were supportive (we're talking 80% plus and even after support fell somewhat, re-electing George Bush).

As fucked up as what is happening in Gaza, if you want to understand the crux of the pushback by Israel and its supporters, you have to keep this context in mind (which, is similar to how China and most developing countries look at American hypocrisy). They see that the US did it (and, the Europeans, though they don't like to admit their participation) and Americans had no problem with it for years until the war dragged on longer than expected and people realized it was based on (the obviously) false information. Meanwhile when another country acts in the same way as the US but on a smaller scale, they're accused (as they should be) of genocide, war crimes, etc."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It seems to me that modern media consumers are not facing up to the global history of conflicts, world wars, and technology of warfare since year 1901. It is technically possible to travel across the world, from North America to the Iraq and inflict huge numbers of deaths. In the name of preventing deaths of the mower powerful and wealthy nation, much of this is now done with rockets and from airplanes in the sky - with almost none of the people doing the killing having much risk. A small crew of an airplane can kill thousands of people on the ground using sophisticated technology. People are entirely detached from what goes on at macro scale of the entire Earth in terms of hate and warfare, dehumanizaton, of out-groups. Malala from Pakistan is one of the few people today who gets media coverage who calls out this gross and disgusting behavior of humans in regard to out-group patterns (men vs. women, religion vs. religion, elder vs. children marriage and sexual exploitation). Yet, I don't see social media society showing any interest in repeating Malala's memes / wrods / speeches / video interviews since year 2013 when she did press tours and published her book. Instead, since year 2013 I see the opening of the Ukraine war and people discussing ideas from Putin and Donald Trump every single day for over a decade. Where is social media actually educating people and teaching people about true progress that Malala of Pakistan speaks of? Or even Pussy Riot from Russia? Do people think Ukraine and Pakistan are covered in the 1,400 year old Quran stories and 2,000 year old Bible stories? If social media users don't show interest in people outside of Donald Trump and MAGA - who exactly is teaching moraity of good from bad? Donald Trump is teaching morality: immigrants bad, liberals bad. Why is nobody asserting far supperior morality teachers in the face of MAGA and Donald Trump and Israel and Palestine? Humans learn civilization from each other. Society is a form of technology, and if we do not teach and educate each other on choices and values of society, we end up in war and hate. Technology of killing machines and murder devices alone is chasing humanity, it is becoming easier and easier to splatter brains with military force and terrroism acts than we have found to teach morality. But really, how hard and difficult is it for people on social media to stop repeating Donald Trump and MAGA and repeat Malala from Pakistean's 2013 book instead? Everything is media ecology. Why is [Pussy Riot not good enough to repeat with regularity on social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-bKFo30o2o) isntead of mimicing and behaving like Donald Trump role model? ===:::

People act like national flags and oceans somehow change the behavior of the human brain when it comes to mob mentality and Mass Psychosis behaviors. As Carl Jung emphasized in 1945, Germany did not grasp with self-awareness either. Do we teach this in schools? They sure don't [teach Mass Psychosis as a topic in USA schools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M)! They don't even seem to teach the term "egomania" in USA schools because it applies to Donald Trump and Elon Musk and I rarely see people use it. What I see is baby-talk about Trump wearing diapers and being a baby child. Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee ignored on Reddit and not cited? These tiny Tweet-length Twitter thinking reaction comments of "unhinged" are made by the thousands each day, people on social media who can not match their thoughts and concerns up to book atuhors, long-form articles and cite them. Instead, it's 500 Twitter-think messages that people ignore as they scroll off the page (they will no longer be on front page of Reddit tomorrow) and wait for another "breaking news event" to repeat the same concerns. There is no sustained focus on the topic nor call for same. Even something as simple as being able to cite a specific person and their analaysis of the situation such as "we should all repeat what Harlan Ellison said about the past 8,000 years in the Middle East" and "We should all focus on and repeat that Joseph Campbell in 1987 said the 3 Middle East religoins had disqualified themselves for the future, and what MAGA in USA has done with Donald Trump $59.99 Bible and Palestine Isreal conflict of October 7, 2023... and September 11, 2001 and other events show this to be true. The clergy needs deep reformation." And you do see some of these types of activites on Reddit / Bluesky and other social media, but it doesn't get sustained attention. The conflicts between the groups is sustained (8,000 years from Harlan Ellison perspective)... but the need to expand compassion and love and world peace gets mocked and avoided as topics. Humanity is the originator of love and compassion teaching and education, and yet, we don't behave as if human persons on social media have any role in teaching it. Only that Russian "bots" can teach MAGA to hate and believe anti-science falsehoods. Only a faith in social media negative, not a true positive. ===:::

"Yikes dude!

Netanyahu could do a genocide in an afternoon, Putin would have done a 3 days special operation in Ukraine and Trump would have ended the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours.

Some leaders have gone completely nuts and also lost the track of time."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The losing track of time is the social media society. And endless consumption of fragments of ideas that are short and scoll off the screen and people not declaring the need to revisit topics in a way that isn't just reacting to "breaking news" or entertaining poses / framing of a subject. People treat the "news cycle" like human beings don't control it. Wehn infact, Sunday Church Day, Friday Islamic Prayer Day, are demonstrations of humanity controlling the information / education / news cycles. Why don't we have a world conflict day of the week, Tuesday and Saturday and revisit if ideas are going forward? People like Malala in Pakstian make breaking news in year 2012 for getting shot on a school bus - but since there is no "breaking news" then progress of education, understanding, leraning, comprehension doesn't get reviwed until a school gets bombed or school shooting. It's all reactionary and often incredibly superficial and shallow in the popularity of react-comments. This is exactly what Neil Postman in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" was warning us about. Fragmented comprehension from the way we all consume information / "news cycle". Thre is an absence of social media assertion that people in Palestine deserve freedom, liberty such as a 16 year old child who would want to plan their life in university. There is an absence of what the clergy is supposed to do in society: promote compassion, love, a "world view" from outer-space gods upon humanity to see the bigger picture of our behaviors. The kind of view Carl Sagan had in Pale Blue Dot book and poem. ===:::

"I think the bigger thing that many are missing is internet misinformation posts that farm said feelings. Before the lies and misinformation were maybe just a news paper or the local crazy.

But now the misinformation is online and on at everyones fingertips 24/7 and 365 days a year. On apps and websites that mentally encourage users to keep coming back over and over again. With apps and videos that decrease attention spans and are addictive so you keep coming back.

The people that post these videos too can make whole careers out of and if they get big enough, they can have a whole career and internet fame and podcast ect. So they are encouraged to keep posting and putting out more and more content and fake theories.

Plus there word and misinformation can get spread around in secounds once they hit upload. Then onto of that they now have politicians that are willing to dip so low as to spread their word and bullshit on the political stage.

Then on top of that researching now is hard for many. Many dont know how to do it (as many dont even know how to go looking for a proper trustworthy source) and even if they did the amount of time that it would take to researching every topic you see online, it would be extremely difficult and most people dont have that kind of time or energy to go look."

"Misinformation works as well as it does because these people want to hear this shit. Its not like misinformation is going: "green aliens control the government".

Misinformation from republicans are implemented ideas and thoughts that have been pushed for nearly 50 years now.

There are multiple interviews done with republican voters where the interviewer asks the voter what they want out of politics, then explains both republicans stance and democrats stance on those points, and even gets the voter to admit yes democrats would be better for them in both the short-term and long-term.

AND then the voter says he still cant vote for a democrat....

Its not like they dont like Trump's policies. They just dont like that its happening to them. They wanted it to happen to other people. They wanted to hurt other people. They just didnt think they themselves were in the "other" category.

If you can convince a group of people that another group of people are not as "human" as they are, they are more willing to accept and even demand harm to the other groups."

"Not only in the US. We have the same problem here in Europe: parts of the political landscape are telling people that there are simple solutions to complex problems. This alone causes everyone who is concerned about the problems to lose all legitimacy in their eyes. Many people no longer want to or are unable to engage deeply with issues. Everyone tells them that things need to change, but that it won't hurt. The pandemic has also brought science deniers out of the shadows, and thanks to social media, they have gained a very loud voice. It's a difficult mix."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We are dealing with widespread symptoms of information overload, that is how I predicted the Arab Spring in December 2009 and participated online all 2010 and traveled to North Africa December 3, 2010 before it became world famous revolution a couple weeks later. The Internet and smartphone (iPhone introduced middle of year 2007) has changed everything about society. But it originated in USA, social media was created in USA, ASCII was in USA before Unicode. 8-bit computers could not easily process beyond the Latin alphabet, Japan was the big adopter of non-ASCII, but China and other non-Latin characters were not trivial to use social media systems such as CompuServe or BBS systems in 1980's (I created and sold BBS systems in 1985). RAM and fixed storage was so incredibly limited and expensive in the 1980's that double-byte character sets were difficult, and the resolution of computer screens so crude that complex Chinese languages were an not yet common. When I worked for SAP in the early 1990's, they were selling total business solutions connecting Asian factories to European and American companies, overseas factory to design / marketing / management centers. Unicode wasn't introduced until 1991 as a standard. SAP R/3 on newly introduced Windows NT (July 27, 1993) you could see the raw state of multiple-language. Even today in August 2025, social media apps like Bluesky and Mastodon don't deal with formatting of Arabic and Unicode the same way on hashtags, left side alignment, right-side alignment, etc. Back when I worked for SAP on R/3 and deployment / training centers on the newly emerging Windows NT 3.5 (first version)... you could see these problems. Copy/paste between apps was not easy once you mix Unicode languages. Ok, enough of the personal experience on this - the CORE message I want to assert: Teach people media ecology is not optional. The entire world of over 8 billion people is communicating together, we need to teach the history of media systems and how technical aspects like ASCII character sets vs. Unicode influence cultures. How Reddit used to have no image or video hosting and the social change that reaction-images of film scenes and clips changes behavior vs. long-form Unicode messages. Everything is media ecology. Tower of Babel metaphor abounds! ===:::

People elect leaders that project confidence and assert simple answers to complex problems.

"Technically, around 30% of any population do seem to be too 'stupid' for democracy. They are easily swayed by fear and emotion, so are easy to propagandise into voting against their own interests.

I'm using the word stupid because you did. But it is not actually all related to IQ at all.

This is how the Conservative and right wing parties always manage to stay close to, or in, power all over the world, despite not actually offering their voters policy that improves their lives. They can use propaganda, single issues, and culture wars to reliably capture that 30%.

Once you have that 30%, all you need to do is work on disenfranchisement, gerrymandering, voter apathy and possibly even a bit of election interference/fraud to make sure it's enough to gain power."

"The same in the Netherlands. Serious housing crisis (and I mean serious!), prices of every day groceries and costs of health care are rising and some horrid politicians (I won't name names) tweet on X about 'it's all the fault of the immigrants' and 'they get homes while 'we' don't' and other racist, bigoted crap.

No sir, it's because of the policies of three decades: privatization of housing, health care and public transportation enabled hedge funds, (foreign) investors and greedy corporations to get their grubby little hands on public funds. Lucrative tax loopholes enabled foreign multinationals to use my country as their own private tax paradise. Without paying a dime, of course. That's left to the citizens.

And to divert the attention from their own failures and ineptitude, they use the age-old scapegoat. It used to be jews or gypsies, now it's moslems. A small (2-5%) percentage, easily identifiable portion of the population to blame. They treat politics as a reality show and a lot of people eat it up because it is served as bite sized one-liners.

Hence the rise of right wing freaks."

The very idea of dividing things left vs. right, conservative vs liberal, is a one-bit TWO and ONLY TWO sides thinking system (bi-polar mindset). The world doesn't divide this way, it is a grossly simplistic view. You are better off viewing fiction vs. nonfiction than left-wing vs. right-wing.

Thames Water is predominately owned by a bunch of large wealth funds, and are £17bn in debt. They got a £3bn cash flow loan as they were out of cash (apparently at 9.75%!), and one of the things they spent this on were bonuses of £2.5m for senior management.

"What also baffles me though...

I used to think that the lack of free media was the key to spreading hate and misinforation, and to allowing the rise of fascism. Surely the internet would allow everyone to easily find the truth, no matter what's being claimed by politicians or their propaganda channels...

Turns out the opposite is true.

"This has been an overall trend since the rise of the internet and social media. 

Like 2 decades or so ago Salman Rushdie lamented the rise of non professional book reviews on the Internet, and at the time I shrugged it off as democratization, and the breaking down of the old ivory tower etc. and overall I thought it was a good thing.

But overtime the Internet has turned into some of the dumbest people posing as intellectuals to get their nut. Like people online are talking about eating rotten meat to be healthy, and staring at the sun to recharge their eyes, eating nothing but raw meat, drinking urine.... Just to focus on that little corner of crazy. 

But I underestimated how badly the average person needs established structures and institutions to give structure to their beliefs and ideas. When they lose those things, they become extremely unhinged and begin seeking these structure seemingly anywhere.

"Because there is no politics in this country, there is only the televised spectacle of politics-as-kayfabe.

Part of “doing politics” is providing members of a political party a political education, and for especially radical parties, an education in political economy.

When is the last you went to a party meeting? Do you know anyone who goes to party meetings?

We do not do politics in this country. The major parties are fronts for corporate cartels (like the EU itself, started as a coal and steel cartel propped up by the American military machine after WWII) specifically designed to diffuse democratic energy from below and obscure the reality of the world-the state-the economy with fetishized religious narratives and scapegoats.

Americans believe they are doing “politics” when they “vote with their dollars,” because we are a society of hyper-individualized, hyper-atomized people who relate to each other as strangers and potential threats and so require an alienating transactional social ritual to mediate conflict between and coordinate activity among people.

“Liberty” here is tied to property, and is individually maximal in its assertion of freedoms with absolutely no conception of a social embeddedness of which we are a part, and to which we belong.

This is the ideology of the slaver, and explains how they could say with a straight face that slavery equals liberty, because to them liberty equals property. This country will not change until we overturn this paradigm and invoke a new socially embedded politics."

"Well to go back to “traditional” roots would require the job market to start paying these married men way more to support their families

Cost of living would have to plummet for society to manage and support the old nuclear model because compared to 50 years ago houses are up like 1000% and cars are up 500% and groceries are up 200-300% depending on the item but I think wages are only up 150% comparatively

No I did not double check and look up the exact numbers, I don’t think the exact number is relevant and the magnitudes are close enough"

"My sister is a teacher in the local school district and also has kids who go to local schools. We were talking about how silly it is that one day out of each week we have a different pickup time for our kids so the administration can have a weekly meeting, which is apparently too expensive and/or cumbersome to do before or after normal school hours once a week.

My dad, always eager to chime in about politics he doesn’t understand, started railing against the teachers union for that. My sister, who has a significantly vested interest in all things teachers union since she is literally a part of it, quickly pointed out that the union is very much in favor of consistent off times for children because it’s better for the kids when no one is confused about what time they leave. Dad, undeterred, continued his claim that the teachers union is “too powerful” despite us literally having a discussion about a think happening that they were against.

Forget about the *bigger* picture, you can’t even get these people to talk about the actual picture at all."

Everything is literally an effort to make poor people poorer.

"The "traditional" lifestyle where any random guy could earn enough to buy a house and support a stay at home wife with kids is basically just a result of the complete world dominance of the USA after WW2. Nowadays a lot of countries have caught up (or at least partially so) and the world isn't all about just funneling as much wealth as possible to the US."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : BINGO! A one-time economic gain of solders returning from Europe and Japan world war and having money saved and women waiting and baby boom / economic boom. Then the coputer and elctronics industry started building up in 1960's. Sports stars and rock music stars in the 1960's were paid almost nothing and the record cartels hadn't yet realized they could sell songs for 40 years, Hollywood didn't realize they could sell 1960's Star Trek for decades and keep earning off content copyright. All these are one-time gains until the rest of the world caught up. Just like the California gold rush in year 1849 and Alaska gold rush are one-time gains. You can clear-cut old-groth timber forests and dig out goold only once, it isn't a sustinable lifestyle. China's povery and growth is a one-tine systemic change. Exporting manufacturing (as Carl Sagan called out in year 1995 book: ["I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries"](https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md). There is an absence in society of one-time gains. The video game industry money we see today isn't something we can keep inventing (the faith in funding artificial intelligence right now in year 2025...). At some point, we need to face the Nazi Germany equation about economic growth. The Second Bill of Rights January 1944 equation (5 months before D-Day Normandy landing).

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The waves of the economic trade wars and attacking Canada and Greenland are still ready to come back and hit upon the shores of North America. Donald Trump gave a fuck-you middle finger signal to goodness itself (Canadians) on the world stage and that signal hasn't been reversed or announced as a mistake. Christmas Holiday Season 2025 is approaching and School Season is ramping... and a nation of 0.34 billion people in a world of over 8 billion people are going to get waves of counter-USA. Dometic USA people will start to notice that they have been bamboozled with the economy and feel hopeless that they can't do anything. Homeless has already been under attack, the vice is closing in on USA. Humanism is abandoned. Donald Trump already lit the fuse of economic warfare, the explosions haven't started yet. "do some dark dark shit" has been in your face all year 2025, not in the future, but already fuse lit. Russia won, Surkov won, Putin won since March 2013. ===:::

"It's not hypocrisy, and it is consistent, you're just not framing it correctly.

Their actual position is, has always been, continues to be, and will always be: "Anything we do is good, anything you do is bad, any harm we commit is justified, any perceived harm we can pin on you is unacceptable. Anything that we have to do to win is justifiable, and anything you do to fight back is unjustifiable."

When you look at them from THAT framing, they're incredibly consistent. The ends justify the means to them. Their stated position on any given issue will always be "whatever would have to be true in order to support the notion that we are right and you are wrong" and that stated position is as malleable as it needs to be to justify the "what we want is right and what you want is wrong" overall position, which has *never* changed."

"And i still keep having asshole conservatives act like they aren't pushing to make America a Christian version of Afghanistan.

I will always stand by this regardless of how this makes people feel. Christians are just as if not worse then Muslims. And its mainly because america has a bias and cant see how insane Christianity can be.

Literally both follow the same rules and have similar stances. Both hate gay people. But Christians love to dress their hatred up with some insane bs aka gay conversion therapy or praying the gay away. Which leads to them not wanting things like gay marriage to exist let alone gay rights. And then it becomes anti sodomy laws and well give it enough time they will start getting homicidal.

They see it as a mental illness/moral failing/greatest sin. And well read the Bible and what it says about gay people. That's what Christians want. They feel god is displeased and that america needs biblical law to make what they see as wrong right. 

They are just working up the courage to do it. Gay conservatives are really stupid because they really played with fire and are gonna get burned."

"For one, we need to help people in our life who don't read the news, "aren't political," or even voted for him to actually see the truth. Otherwise they'll eat up the propaganda "

"This man constantly repeats dystopian level shit that is completely divorced from any kind of reality that actually exists in any of these cities. I lived in New York City for six years (moved out last year temporarily). I have never, not one time, at ANY point, walked outside towards the subway on my way to work feeling terrified for my life. I came home at 2-3 AM especially in college years more times than I can count. It is safer than 95% of suburbs.

This fucking prick just walks out and just yells “CRIME CRIME CRIME” over and over again towards the clouds trying to convince people of this alternative reality that only happens in his head. The disappointing thing to me isn’t even him at this point. He’s a lost cause, he is what he is. The capitulation of an entire political party that has reformed their entire platform to worship this man as a messiah is the disappointing part. How do these people sleep at night."

"Thing is you can’t even argue with them. If you prove their beliefs wrong with objective data, they say the data is fake made up by radical Democrats. If something bad happens in their life as a result of a Trump policy, it’s “well Biden did it.” I truly don’t know how to get through to people like that.

These people are trained at this point to believe half the country is evil. We didn’t start this shit - I don’t recall any of this animosity from the general public in 2012 (aka the last election I wasn’t scared shitless about), besides the usual Fox suspects. I didn’t visit a traditionally red state and have the first thing coming into my mind be “oh what a shithole this place is.” One guy with a massive ego started spewing this nonsense over and over again and a media gave him free airtime because they thought he was funny. The chain of events it started to get us to this point will never have me not utterly mind blown."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Russia won, Surkov won, since March 2013. USA people have a civic duty to study Russian information warfare and start teachng cult deprogramming. Stop mocking and insulting the cult of MAGA and address the problem on social media, sustain teaching of ficiton addiciton war. Defend against Putin's IRA aftermath, stop acting like it will fix itself and rescue people. Look to Malala standing up to ignorance and poor literacy in Swat Valley Pakistan since January 2009 for ideas. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And people can't face up that Neil Postman's 1985 book is correct. Funny, humor, amusement is the exploit of Russian information warfare since March 2013. People think Donald Trump is hilarious and funny. Mixing entertainment with news without actually caring if the "news" you consume is factual or truth has driven the USA into addiction to fiction funny content.

"Here in Texas, suburban houses had “Pray for America!” signs all over their yards during Biden’s term. Those signs have mysteriously disappeared since the pedo in chief became president. Both their patriotism and religion are performative. It’s so sickening that it’s almost funny."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "It’s so sickening that it’s almost funny." - once you come to terms that the entire Middle East religion systems have become about being funny and mocking the other religions, Torah vs. Quran vs. Bubble and that people are finding it funny todeath - you start to have the tools of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusig Ourselves to Death" to address the people who are not self-aware that mocking and ... "Both their patriotism and religion are performative. It’s so sickening that it’s almost funny". It isn't just in Texas. You are seeing trees and not the entire global forest of media ecology. Learn about Swat Valley, Pakstin from Malala's October 8, 2013 book. Manh parallels to Texas. NOTE: it is impossible to easily know if this is a fake Kremlin or MAGA account on Reddit, my message of media ecology literacy stands even if the message is insincere. I have lived in Texas since the early 1990's mutliple times, I have studied extensively how people reacted to the Hill Country floods July 4, 2025 - as I used to live in Canyon Lake, Texas and have been to Kerville several times in RV full time living. The media ecology crisis defined by Neil Postman in New York City back in year 1985 applies to Texas society. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reddit messages: Give up on Americans, give up on reason thinking, abadon the world to Putin's inforamtion warfare since March 2013 IRA invasion of social media.

As if doing zero ("I suggest not commenting any further to save whatever bit of sanity you have left") is going to keep thing sane in USA under 10 years of Donald Trump and anti-intellectual agenda.

"Joe Biden did not get 15 million more votes than Obama. They stole the 2020 election, an idiots coke heads ran the White House. I guess everybody here enjoyed six dollar gasoline or you weren’t old enough to pay for the gas. Maybe you enjoy the gay sex being filmed in Congress. Trump won a clear majority of the votes, and didn’t have to spend $1 billion like Kamala just to lose. Obama and his gang are all going to jail because they’re treasonous traitors. The classified info just keeps getting declassified, making them all look like guilty traders."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : No citations, no links, no authors quoted. Just a bunch of claims. Reddit is long-form social media. But like all news in USA, it's just a stream of conetnt that scrolls off screens and people don't view information itself as the problem. Every person in a filter-bubble and few people wanting to face that human truth and human comprehension are a global problem of 8 billion people. Why are stable systems of information that is refined like Wikipedia not being called for instead of a constant stream of reaction comments on Blueksy, Twitter, Redit, TikTok? The answer invovles people being addicted to the stimulation of constant content - which Donald Trump provides - constant breaking news and entertainment. Stable organized information with citations and cross-references, a Wikipedia style system, is something people don't even recognize is absent in the sports mentality streaming social machine society. Humanity, all across the globe, will sink if entertainment and mocking of truth as boring and tedious is how we program our minds, how we educate our children and adults alike to value information. ===:::

Is there anyone out there who believes he couldn't have stopped them?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Truth is not attractive anymore. It is considered tedious and boring. Truth went out of fashion. Factual reality is no longer cool or in style. Societies can live without truth and sincerity, that's what Malala describes Swat Valley, Pakistan society like under the Taliban. And Russia under Putin for the past 25 years people live in fiction. Middle East Palestine and Israel both live under clergy of Torah and Quran fiction that one and only one book is perfect in all the public library. ===:::

"Exactly this.

Trump supporters spent years claiming that January 6th 2021 was Nancy Pelosi's fault, as they claimed she had responsibility for calling out the National Guard in Washington DC. Of course, at the same time, Trump supporters claimed that it was either, or both, a peaceful walk through the halls of Congress, or a violent invasion for by Antifa disguised as Trump supporters.

Now that Trump himself has called out the National Guard and gone on television to explain that he is calling out the National Guard, I fully expect those same Trump supporters to not say anything at all."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The entire USA has been under siege from Kremlin informaiton warfare against reality itself since March 2013. A war against understanding and comprehension.

No, they'll switch to the new talking points and pretend that the old ones never existed.

Even if you showed them a video of Trump himself saying he couldn't call out the National Guard, that only Pelosi could do that, they'll come with some excuse for why we've always been at war with Eurasia."
