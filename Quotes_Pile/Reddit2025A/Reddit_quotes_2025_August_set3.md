"All of this stems at least in part from the rise of anti-intellectualism in the US. Too many people have been coddled into a society where how you "feel" about reality and what you "want" to believe is validated and given equal weight to objectivity.

So we've got people voting for leaders who say the things that confirm their feelings rather than the truth. We're all about to find out what happens when you run an economy on vibes alone."

"I think the bigger thing that many are missing is internet misinformation posts that farm said feelings. Before the lies and misinformation were maybe just a news paper or the local crazy.

But now the misinformation is online and on at everyones fingertips 24/7 and 365 days a year. On apps and websites that mentally encourage users to keep coming back over and over again. With apps and videos that decrease attention spans and are addictive so you keep coming back.

The people that post these videos too can make whole careers out of and if they get big enough, they can have a whole career and internet fame and podcast ect. So they are encouraged to keep posting and putting out more and more content and fake theories.

Plus there word and misinformation can get spread around in secounds once they hit upload. Then onto of that they now have politicians that are willing to dip so low as to spread their word and bullshit on the political stage.

Then on top of that researching now is hard for many. Many dont know how to do it (as many dont even know how to go looking for a proper trustworthy source) and even if they did the amount of time that it would take to researching every topic you see online, it would be extremely difficult and most people dont have that kind of time or energy to go look."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The idea that every person has to do "their own research" (famous phrase: "Do your own research crowd") is toxic. [Everything in society becomes a booby-trap](../../Important/Booby_Trapped_Reality.md). Honesty, sincerity, citation, source of information are essential to an information worker society / technology society. Donald Trump attracts people who flock to "sounds good" like Joe Rogan and Fox News and Elon Musk Twitter. Short-form social media was called out by Carl Sagan in 1995. ===:::

"Misinformation works as well as it does because these people want to hear this shit. Its not like misinformation is going: "green aliens control the government".

Misinformation from republicans are implemented ideas and thoughts that have been pushed for nearly 50 years now.

There are multiple interviews done with republican voters where the interviewer asks the voter what they want out of politics, then explains both republicans stance and democrats stance on those points, and even gets the voter to admit yes democrats would be better for them in both the short-term and long-term.

AND then the voter says he still cant vote for a democrat....

Its not like they dont like Trump's policies. They just dont like that its happening to them. They wanted it to happen to other people. They wanted to hurt other people. They just didnt think they themselves were in the "other" category.

If you can convince a group of people that another group of people are not as "human" as they are, they are more willing to accept and even demand harm to the other groups."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Long-form social media is good, except that in this case no author or book or expanded material is cited. Where did this person hear these ideas, who is their source and research on the subject. There has become a trend to behave like RFK Jr and Donald Trump and provide long-form information but not cite well researched authors or writings. People aren't encouraged to go to the public library and instead consume a page of information and move on to a completely different subject. Improtant topics drown in the constant context changes, the social media streaming memes and reactions to Donald Trump White House. Absent is asserts like this Reddit message saying: "We really need to make Neil Postman's 1985 book a household name and get everyone on the sae page of these topics. Malala in Pakistan also had a lot to say in her 2013 book about how the Taliban used Radio Mullah to influence poor people." - there is no rally point of common understanding. You witness all July 2025 / August 2025 (past 6 weeks) constant calls for "Epstein List", but you do not see such messaging of constant calls "We all need to read Neil Postman's 1985 book" to address the intellectual problems of society, that MAGA bleieves falsehoods and fiction.  It is just a message that is in conversation that will be ignored after it ages out in 48 hours... and not treating this problem as one of the most iportant and serious topics of our time that has been gong on since March 2013 rise of MAGA and Donald Trump's constant society attention and focus. ===:::

"Yeah, there’s this guy on TikTok called The Elder Millenial that literally just spouts off with multiple easily disproven bullshit right wing propaganda videos all day every day to the point where I’m pretty sure it’s his full time job now.

And even though the comments are usually calling out his lies, it doesn’t matter. He’ll leave the videos up even when he’s proven wrong because the engagement is all that matters. Lies or no lies—the guy has over half a million followers. For every one person who calls him out, ten more go “Yeah! You tell em! Stupid libs.”

Like… How do we even combat this? The truth doesn’t matter as long as it affirms the beliefs of whomever’s consuming it. These damn phones have broken our brains and I honestly don’t see any way out of it.

Not to mention, I was raised in the rural south and went to a backwoods podunk public school in a bottom five state in education rankings. And yet I was taught how to verify my sources. I was taught how to distinguish trusted information from opinion. How is it that so many other goddamn people have just completely forgot? Really makes my brain hurt."

"See I use to want to argue with some of these people but, one I know in real life proudly told me one of the "facts" he learned online from one of these creators.

That fact was that the big planes spreading "chem trails" only have enough fuel for take off and that they dont need any for mid flight or landing.

Completely blind to physics or math's.

Altbough i would say half want to affirm their beliefs I think to the other half it doesnt even matter if it affirms their beliefs. From what I know of some of these people they ALL have some dark hole in there life, be it a mental problem, money problems, health problems or shitty up bringing ect. And they all want to blame it on someone or take their frustration out on someone, some higher power and fantasy land.

All these people look to is some creator pumping them content and telling them how to feel, how to think and who to hate. With some sprinkles of hidden shady powers and evil people pulling the strings screwing them and everyone else over."

"they kinda told the truth, they will never care about "your" feelings cause you arent a real person like they are so their feelings matter, yours dont. its part of conservatives embracing of authoritarianism over the last 40 odd years, they wouldnt be trying to gerrymander if they believed in democracy."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  "its part of conservatives embracing of authoritarianism over the last 40 odd years" - 40 years ago is when Neil Postman's 1985 book about television media, electric media (social media) was created. Amusing / Entertaining ourselves to death. And it is a mistake to view "conservatives embracing of authoritarianism" as a recent trend, the entire stories of the Levant religions: Torah, Quran, Bible are all based on heavy authoritarianism teachings to children at the youngest age in Mosque, Church, Synagogue / parenting. All human history of Levant religions. [Study Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan year 2013](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/24987300-i-am-malala-the-girl-who-stood-up-for-education-and-was-shot-by-the-tal), which is VERY FAR from Mecca and Quran origins, as is California from Bible / Jesus storytelling origins. "conservatives embracing of authoritarianism" in Saudi Arabia has been ongoing for thousands of years! It is really only since world war two that USA society broke free of the Bible / Church fiction authoritarianism indoctrination. ["And the scientific game, after all, may not be any truer, but it is vaster, and it takes in a bigger range of facts and experience.

And since the days of the Second World War, it has gone through all the planet." - 1961](../Joseph_Campbell_Quotes.md) ...

"Idiots love authoritarianism.  Its warm and fuzzy to not have to think and to just  trust some authoritarian leader or religious teaching instead facing reality.  

 It also takes away self responsibility.  You can just be "following orders" or push it "must be god's will." "

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : it's more about self-awareness. Calling other people idiots with short-length Twitter-think messages is exactly what MAGA / Donald Trump encourages. Everyone in USA calling everyone else stupid idiots. It's has been the core thinking of out-group idiots for a decade, tree after tree of people calling others idiots without seeing the forest of March 2013 Russian media invasion. Surkov students and Cambridge Analytica have induced these feedback loops in social media society USA where constantly mocking has formed a total mockery society. Insulting and belittlement of the problems of education, comprehension, [filter-bubble media consumption](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15503719-the-filter-bubble-what-the-internet-is-hiding-from-you), etc dominates thinking as ideas scroll of the page and are not connected together as a forest-level problem while people react-comment on media machines to tree after tree of streaming memes and messages. The Reddit comment says: "Idiots love authoritarianism.  Its warm and fuzzy to not have to think and to just  trust some authoritarian leader or religious teaching" - I would encourage rephrasing it to: **"out-group Levant-based societies love authoritarianism (Allah, Yahweh, Jesus, cloud computing systems, top-down media networks of Mosque, Synagogue, Church, Rupert Murdoch). It is warm and fuzzy to not have to think much and to just trust some authoritarian media content or religious teaching while calling the others who use competing media systems (Quran vs. Torah vs. Bible) as idiots and an infidels / gentiles."** ===:::

"Not only in the US. We have the same problem here in Europe: parts of the political landscape are telling people that there are simple solutions to complex problems. This alone causes everyone who is concerned about the problems to lose all legitimacy in their eyes. Many people no longer want to or are unable to engage deeply with issues. Everyone tells them that things need to change, but that it won't hurt. The pandemic has also brought science deniers out of the shadows, and thanks to social media, they have gained a very loud voice. It's a difficult mix."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We are dealing with widespread symptoms of information overload, that is how I predicted the Arab Spring in December 2009 and participated online all 2010 and traveled to North Africa December 3, 2010 before it became world famous revolution a couple weeks later. The Internet and smartphone (iPhone introduced middle of year 2007) has changed everything about society. But it originated in USA, social media was created in USA, ASCII was in USA before Unicode. 8-bit computers could not easily process beyond the Latin alphabet, Japan was the big adopter of non-ASCII, but China and other non-Latin characters were not trivial to use social media systems such as CompuServe or BBS systems in 1980's (I created and sold BBS systems in 1985). RAM and fixed storage was so incredibly limited and expensive in the 1980's that double-byte character sets were difficult, and the resolution of computer screens so crude that complex Chinese languages were an not yet common. When I worked for SAP in the early 1990's, they were selling total business solutions connecting Asian factories to European and American companies, overseas factory to design / marketing / management centers. Unicode wasn't introduced until 1991 as a standard. SAP R/3 on newly introduced Windows NT (July 27, 1993) you could see the raw state of multiple-language. Even today in August 2025, social media apps like Bluesky and Mastodon don't deal with formatting of Arabic and Unicode the same way on hashtags, left side alignment, right-side alignment, etc. Back when I worked for SAP on R/3 and deployment / training centers on the newly emerging Windows NT 3.5 (first version)... you could see these problems. Copy/paste between apps was not easy once you mix Unicode languages. Ok, enough of the personal experience on this - the CORE message I want to assert: Teach people media ecology is not optional. The entire world of over 8 billion people is communicating together, we need to teach the history of media systems and how technical aspects like ASCII character sets vs. Unicode influence cultures. How Reddit used to have no image or video hosting and the social change that reaction-images of film scenes and clips changes behavior vs. long-form Unicode messages. Everything is media ecology. Tower of Babel metaphor abounds! ===:::

"The qualities that help people get elected to leadership are rarely the qualities that make good leaders.

People elect leaders that project confidence and assert simple answers to complex problems.

Good leaders will admit that complex problems will require difficult and nuanced solutions. However, people see this as weakness... becuase they're stupid."

"Technically, around 30% of any population do seem to be too 'stupid' for democracy. They are easily swayed by fear and emotion, so are easy to propagandise into voting against their own interests.

I'm using the word stupid because you did. But it is not actually all related to IQ at all.

This is how the Conservative and right wing parties always manage to stay close to, or in, power all over the world, despite not actually offering their voters policy that improves their lives. They can use propaganda, single issues, and culture wars to reliably capture that 30%.

Once you have that 30%, all you need to do is work on disenfranchisement, gerrymandering, voter apathy and possibly even a bit of election interference/fraud to make sure it's enough to gain power."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : A very simple idea. Simplistic. Germany year 1944 vs. Germany year 1994 is radically differnt. the SYSTEM ITSELF of Nazi Germany is not the same as post Berlin Wall 1994 Germany (I worked for SAP and traveled to Walldorf, Germany in the early 1990's). The Reddit comment idea of "Technically, around 30% of any population" makes no accountiing for 1993 Japan vs. 1943 Japan. Germany in 1943 was not liberal or left, Japan in 1943 was not liberal or left, Islamic terrorists are not liberal or left, Palestine is not liberal or left, Israel in year 2024 is not liberal or left. People want to act like it is "Technically, around 30% of any population" on a constant basis in all places. Iran in year 2024 is not liberal or left, does not have liberael democracy. Iran in 1975... People need to WAKE UP from this simplsitic thinking of in-gorup vs. out-group Levant intepretations of gentile / nonbeliever / infidel.

"The same in the Netherlands. Serious housing crisis (and I mean serious!), prices of every day groceries and costs of health care are rising and some horrid politicians (I won't name names) tweet on X about 'it's all the fault of the immigrants' and 'they get homes while 'we' don't' and other racist, bigoted crap.

No sir, it's because of the policies of three decades: privatization of housing, health care and public transportation enabled hedge funds, (foreign) investors and greedy corporations to get their grubby little hands on public funds. Lucrative tax loopholes enabled foreign multinationals to use my country as their own private tax paradise. Without paying a dime, of course. That's left to the citizens.

And to divert the attention from their own failures and ineptitude, they use the age-old scapegoat. It used to be jews or gypsies, now it's moslems. A small (2-5%) percentage, easily identifiable portion of the population to blame. They treat politics as a reality show and a lot of people eat it up because it is served as bite sized one-liners.

Hence the rise of right wing freaks."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This message needs to go a step further on that final sentence: "Hence the rise of right wing freaks" - do people think land-lords, Donald Trump real estate king, are left-wing? The rise of the very idea of expensive rent culture and very few people owning everything like Putin does in Russia and Trump wants in USA is a right-wing value. The very idea of dividing things left vs. right, conservative vs liberal, is a one-bit TWO and ONLY TWO sides thinking system (bi-polar mindset). The world doesn't divide this way, it is a grossly simplistic view. You are better off viewing fiction vs. nonfiction than left-wing vs. right-wing. Fiction can have 500 stories, truth and comprehension can have 1. You can make up **5,000 fiction stories** of how humans interpret the world as Russia did with Cambridge Analytica: ["Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа. Затем.. положить этот образ обратно на всё психотипы и таким образом подобрать универсальный ключик к любому и каждому."](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446). Fiction vs. nonfiction is not a one-bit binary logic. Poetry and dream mythology [rock music lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1LhC1zGouc) and the Quran of Mohammad (retcon of Jesus stories / dreams metaphors) are not simplistic, metaphors are complex and rich, not one-bit thinking of left-wing vs. right-wing, conservative vs. liberal bi-polar thinking of a society. ===:::

"Yup, foreigners and trans people are the "threats" to living standards here. Meanwhile, we privatised the damn water.

Thames Water is predominately owned by a bunch of large wealth funds, and are £17bn in debt. They got a £3bn cash flow loan as they were out of cash (apparently at 9.75%!), and one of the things they spent this on were bonuses of £2.5m for senior management.

They will eventually fail, and the taxpayer will have to bail them out, much in the same way they have the banks, and several train companies.

"What also baffles me though...

I used to think that the lack of free media was the key to spreading hate and misinforation, and to allowing the rise of fascism. Surely the internet would allow everyone to easily find the truth, no matter what's being claimed by politicians or their propaganda channels...

Turns out the opposite is true. People just gravitate towards the echo chambers they WANT to believe, regardless of how easy it's become nowadays to make the distinction between facts and "alternative facts".

"This has been an overall trend since the rise of the internet and social media. 

Like 2 decades or so ago Salman Rushdie lamented the rise of non professional book reviews on the Internet, and at the time I shrugged it off as democratization, and the breaking down of the old ivory tower etc. and overall I thought it was a good thing.

But overtime the Internet has turned into some of the dumbest people posing as intellectuals to get their nut. Like people online are talking about eating rotten meat to be healthy, and staring at the sun to recharge their eyes, eating nothing but raw meat, drinking urine.... Just to focus on that little corner of crazy. 

But I underestimated how badly the average person needs established structures and institutions to give structure to their beliefs and ideas. When they lose those things, they become extremely unhinged and begin seeking these structure seemingly anywhere. 

Back in the earlier days of the internet the breatharians were made fun of, and understood as crazy people..... But somehow the breatharians, and all the others like them, won."

"Because there is no politics in this country, there is only the televised spectacle of politics-as-kayfabe.

Part of “doing politics” is providing members of a political party a political education, and for especially radical parties, an education in political economy.

When is the last you went to a party meeting? Do you know anyone who goes to party meetings?

We do not do politics in this country. The major parties are fronts for corporate cartels (like the EU itself, started as a coal and steel cartel propped up by the American military machine after WWII) specifically designed to diffuse democratic energy from below and obscure the reality of the world-the state-the economy with fetishized religious narratives and scapegoats.

Americans believe they are doing “politics” when they “vote with their dollars,” because we are a society of hyper-individualized, hyper-atomized people who relate to each other as strangers and potential threats and so require an alienating transactional social ritual to mediate conflict between and coordinate activity among people.

“Liberty” here is tied to property, and is individually maximal in its assertion of freedoms with absolutely no conception of a social embeddedness of which we are a part, and to which we belong.

This is the ideology of the slaver, and explains how they could say with a straight face that slavery equals liberty, because to them liberty equals property. This country will not change until we overturn this paradigm and invoke a new socially embedded politics."

"My sister is a teacher in the local school district and also has kids who go to local schools. We were talking about how silly it is that one day out of each week we have a different pickup time for our kids so the administration can have a weekly meeting, which is apparently too expensive and/or cumbersome to do before or after normal school hours once a week.

My dad, always eager to chime in about politics he doesn’t understand, started railing against the teachers union for that. My sister, who has a significantly vested interest in all things teachers union since she is literally a part of it, quickly pointed out that the union is very much in favor of consistent off times for children because it’s better for the kids when no one is confused about what time they leave. Dad, undeterred, continued his claim that the teachers union is “too powerful” despite us literally having a discussion about a think happening that they were against.

All these are one-time gains until the rest of the world caught up. Just like the California gold rush in year 1849 and Alaska gold rush are one-time gains. You can clear-cut old-groth timber forests and dig out goold only once, it isn't a sustinable lifestyle. China's povery and growth is a one-tine systemic change.

There is an absence in society of one-time gains.

Eventually the general in charge of the base had to put out a statement saying no more talk of J6 because there was enough support for J6 within the US military that it was becoming a really heated argument about whether J6 was good or bad."

"On the flip side people need consider if Putin and Bibi are using Epstein to HELP Trump and their initiatives because Americans are fixated only on Epstein

Take a look even in the last 3 weeks what’s going on in the 3 nations

— Trump asserting more control over cities

— Tx, Mo, In redoing districts

— ending mRNA investment

— Israel formally intends to take over all of Gaza

— Russia moving forward on wanting “peace” by obtaining 1/3 of Ukraine.

Meanwhile most of Reddit is just saying ITS A COVER FOR EPSTEIN!!!!!!

Right now. They basically can do whatever they want and the only response they get is EPSTEIN! and not focusing on the fact millions will die unnecessarily due to getting rid of mRNA developments."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Project 2025 manifesto of over 900 pages, is not a distraction from Epstein. QAnon "Q" promoted Pizzagate and Epstein mind patterns for years and years. Project 2025 is happening, the plan was presented, the evidence of the actions / execution of that plan abound. [In 2025, Donald J. Trump signed 183 Executive orders (from EO 14147 through EO 14329)](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/donald-trump/2025) that are not a distraction from the Epstein List. Addiction to QAnon / Pizzagate / Fiction is the crisis of USA society. ===:::

"Besides, they could release video of Trump doing whatever on the island, and the base will continue to deny any of it is real. It's only for our own sanity that rational people want the evidence. Otherwise we need to remain focused on the destruction of our country from within."

"Talking about a real fight gets you banned on most platforms. They have ignored peaceful protests for the last 15 years. All that's left is violence. If real leaders come to the front first maybe the violence can be minimal, but it's rebellion or nothing."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Shallow, simplistic, Russian conditioned self-harm USA thinking reactions. There has been no HIGH ROAD. I have contacted the White House / Pentagon since year 2015 about the Russian informaiton warfare. Murdering, splattering brains, killing people isn't going to fix a media ecology problem. It will only deepen the abandonment of reason thinking in the minds. People have NOT taken the **HIGH ROAD** at all (I asked Joe Biden and Kamala to promote Neil Postman's then 1984 page book in direct letters via the White House website. I asked the NSA to study James Joyce's Finnegans Wake and Marshall McLuhan), the High Road is stop Reality TV "The Apprentice" entertainment addiction, confront addiction to reality TV Donald Trump.

"There's so many fucking people with guns in this country. Fuck me, I'd rather have the barrel pointed in his direction than in my mouth. I can't wrap my head around this - wasn't this exactly what the gun amendment was about? Stopping the tyrrany?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes. But informaiton warfare from Surkov students / IRA / Cambridge Analytica has convinced gun stroking people that fellow North Americans are the enmy, not Putin. In year 2025, people in USA are hating upon North Americans in Canada!  Canada! Wake the fuck up USA!
