"Celebrate what? It doesn't change anything Vance just takes over, people really need to stop thinking all this crazy is Trump, he is a result not a cause. Remember the 77 million people that voted for him are still going to support the madness regardless of the figure head."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  At heart, there is a failure to recognize Mass Man behaviors. Marshall McLuhan of University of Toronto defines the term Mass Man realtive tomedia. A common attraction or repulsion to certain media can create aa group thinking or mob mentality. The confomity and peer pressure that arrises from common external stimulation or information. Cults, religions, even how people behave on one media platform vs.another (or the same media content on a small smartphone screen vs. large cinema). The heart-strings and puppet-strings that media content itself can induce in us, that has become the basis of political parties and warfare. We have reached religion depths and beyond. ===:::

"Oh, it doesn't matter anymore. JD Vance is just the puppet for Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin, and once he's in power they will declare a state of emergency and cancel the elections. They've all but said that that's how they plan on really remaking the country. 25th-ing Trump has been in the cards all along. Once Trump is gone they will roll back the tariffs to appease the base, who will go back to insisting everything is going swimmingly, while also rolling back civil rights and basic freedoms for everyone else at an even more rapid pace."

"He spent years on television perfecting his bulsh#t generator, perhaps surprised at what he could get away with. When he claimed Obama was from Africa and it actually stuck with the low information voters, I think that gave him the validation that he could do anything he wanted with that talent. It's evil, but of course it's a talent. It will go down as one of the most effective con men in all of history."

"MAGA won't give a fuck. 

Seriously, did you see the WOMEN at his rally laughing at his comments about E. Jean Carroll?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : **People DO give a fuck. They are attracted to Trump** the power of a god symbol who is a male mythological symbol in the human subconsious (impanted by society into minds at a firmware level, Judeo-Christian improted Levant mythology art and poetry). Not just MAGA, not just Trump suppoters, but anyone who can not see past the Levant religion sytems of thousands of years ago that they have had zero education on how they operate on the human brain. "They say more about Deuteronomy than about **women**. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, **love and compassion are reserved for the in-group**, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy." - Skywalker Ranch interviews, summer of 1986, Power of Myth book. ===:::

"I think we all know how this is going to end. Maxwell will testify that Trump and Epstein barely knew each other, or tell some other lie that gives Trump enough plausible deniability for MAGA to declare him exonerated. Maxwell will then get pardoned for saving the president from a partisan witch hunt. He’s gotten away with everything so far, why would this be any different.

Now, if we just eat ONE billionaire…"

"This you, Ken?" mocking

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Look, I know to most people I am tedious and boring and repetitive on these subjects. But you have got to take the Levant 3-way monomyth crisis seriously, everything in (former White House director) Bill Moyers interviews at Skywalker Ranch in 1986, 1987, published in "Power of Myth". This was a key to my December 2009 prediction of the Arab Spring in North Africa, a year before it became world famous via Tunisia. Religions ar fiction, extremely compelling fiction that induce compusive group peer pressure and behaviors. This mocking you see is fiction storytelling. You have to take everyting ever written or recorded by [Peter P... and focus on what he published (and linked video) 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4) seriously and see the group behavior patterns play out before Donald Trump's 2015 run for POTUS. And all the perspectives of Neil Postman 1985, 1992, 1995, and even his earlier work. Esentially, how people behave when they don't understand or comprehend reality. Bring in Carl Sagan 1995 on that. The whole world, all geography, all time periods, *turns to fiction* and is avoidant of non-mythological non-fiction. As Sagan said, sooner or later this is going to blow up in our face with the technology humanity has. MAGA is mocking "liberals", while not cross-referencing their own fiction desires to the Taliban via Malala. And now anyone not MAGA in USA is mocking MAGA / Trump. What Russia has "won" is self-destruction of all humanity, they are not in control, they are compusively addicted to the monomyth ficion patterns they mined. And now ChatGPT and other LLM / AI systems have trained on this. ===:::
