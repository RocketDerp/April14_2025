"Celebrate what? It doesn't change anything Vance just takes over, people really need to stop thinking all this crazy is Trump, he is a result not a cause. Remember the 77 million people that voted for him are still going to support the madness regardless of the figure head."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  At heart, there is a failure to recognize Mass Man behaviors. Marshall McLuhan of University of Toronto defines the term Mass Man realtive tomedia. A common attraction or repulsion to certain media can create aa group thinking or mob mentality. The confomity and peer pressure that arrises from common external stimulation or information. Cults, religions, even how people behave on one media platform vs.another (or the same media content on a small smartphone screen vs. large cinema). The heart-strings and puppet-strings that media content itself can induce in us, that has become the basis of political parties and warfare. We have reached religion depths and beyond. ===:::

"Oh, it doesn't matter anymore. JD Vance is just the puppet for Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin, and once he's in power they will declare a state of emergency and cancel the elections. They've all but said that that's how they plan on really remaking the country. 25th-ing Trump has been in the cards all along. Once Trump is gone they will roll back the tariffs to appease the base, who will go back to insisting everything is going swimmingly, while also rolling back civil rights and basic freedoms for everyone else at an even more rapid pace."

"He spent years on television perfecting his bulsh#t generator, perhaps surprised at what he could get away with. When he claimed Obama was from Africa and it actually stuck with the low information voters, I think that gave him the validation that he could do anything he wanted with that talent.

Not just MAGA, not just Trump suppoters, but anyone who can not see past the Levant religion sytems of thousands of years ago that they have had zero education on how they operate on the human brain. "They say more about Deuteronomy than about **women**. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, **love and compassion are reserved for the in-group**, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy." - Skywalker Ranch interviews, summer of 1986, Power of Myth book. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Look, I know to most people I am tedious and boring and repetitive on these subjects. But you have got to take the Levant 3-way monomyth crisis seriously, everything in (former White House director) Bill Moyers interviews at Skywalker Ranch in 1986, 1987, published in "Power of Myth". This was a key to my December 2009 prediction of the Arab Spring in North Africa, a year before it became world famous via Tunisia. Religions ar fiction, extremely compelling fiction that induce compulsive group peer pressure and behaviors. This mocking you see is fiction storytelling. You have to take everything ever written or recorded by [Peter Pomerantsev... and focus on what he published (and linked video) 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4) seriously and see the group behavior patterns play out before Donald Trump's 2015 run for POTUS. And all the perspectives of Neil Postman 1985, 1992, 1995, and even his earlier work. Essentially, how people behave when they don't understand or comprehend reality. Bring in Carl Sagan 1995 on that. The whole world, all geography, all time periods, *turns to fiction* and is avoidant of non-mythological non-fiction. As Sagan said, sooner or later this is going to blow up in our face with the technology humanity has. MAGA is mocking "liberals", while not cross-referencing their own fiction desires to the Taliban via Malala. And now anyone not MAGA in USA is mocking MAGA / Trump. What Russia has "won" is self-destruction of all humanity in out-group feedback loops, Russia is not in control, Russian leaders are compulsively addicted to the monomyth fiction patterns they mined. And now ChatGPT and other LLM / AI systems have trained on this. ===:::

"It's delusional to think Trump is the one going to need flee the country money. He's the one who has solidified executive power and replaced all the military and intelligence agencies top brass with kowtowing loyalists. It's everyone else who's going to need to flee the country. What mechanism do you propose will be used to oust him and force him to go on the run...?"

"It is actually terrifying howv the US voters treat the election of the most powerful Office in the world as a sports match where you are for team blue or red and just want to win complete disregarding any policy or morals about who they vote for.

The way trump behaves and is treated like a narcissistic barbaric king by his voters, politicians and us companies is actually terrifying for me as a European. This kind of stuff is straight up bribery and seeing this happen without any meaningful outcry, let alone a reaction by the republican party shoes that US democracy is dead. There is no room for other voices left, no room for compromis and no room for doubt or choose changes. There is just a obnoxiously bad behaving elderly king and no one cult following either to zealous or to cowardice to see they are destroying US democracy, it's values and eventually it's safety"

This was *Trump*'s Justice department trying to incite civilians to further violence. There was no shadow government, there was no Biden or Obama pulling the strings, it was all Trump, all along.

I was a certified teacher for Microsoft products, I taught Microsoft employees in Redmond Washington. I have studied this attraction to fiction first hand, I am a published author and technical editor of computer books (including social media books). You can't just leave it to chance that people know fiction attraction, you have to take Neil Postman's library of books seriously, especially his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and make sure EVERY PERSON age 12 to age 120 understands media ecology. Mosque, Mecca, Church, Roman Empire, Putin/Surkov Russia... is the evidence of how this ability to distinguish fiction from nonfiction is essential to a functining democracy.

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And the Reddit crowd is jerking off about how dumb stupid idiots MAGA are. It's nothing but out-group hate stimulation anymore. Feedback loops of runaway Russian simualcra. USA lost an infomation war to Putin and Surkov and people are not standing up to escape the total mockery patterns of: A mocks B, B mocks A. Sexual pleasure in the Twitter-length comments plays off the media consumer frenzy of the "Epstein list" sex topics saturaing media in July and August 2025. ===:::

"So they have weaponized the FBI against a political party...are people not seeing this for emergency it is??"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : No, they are not seeing it. They have context bewilderment and can't connect the dots to Russian information warfare against mutliple NATO nations. [As Doctor Carl Jung spelled out, the Germans did not grasp or comprehend what they were doing](../Doctors/Carl_Jung.md) as they did it. Detachment from reality, Russia won the War Against Reality. Putin won, Surkov won. Do you really thing being tricked by Putin and Trump is enjoyable, that it is authentically fun to be a mental slave to Donald Trump? You have to view this that the laughing and mocking is a symptom of *lost heart and mind to enemy*.. Do you think Islamic terrorists are RALLY winning rewards in Heaven afterlife or they have been mind-fucked? That's Doctor Carl Jung's point, German people did not grasp their own behaviors. REPEATING: Russia won, Surkov won. ===:::

"Was more important to own the libs and remind Mexicans that they’re inferior to Real Americans, apparently"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : It was more important to make reaction comments on social media than make Jen Senko's March 2016 film a constant social media mention. It was more important to share memes and entertainment than to share Neil Postman's 1985 book about the possibilty if Ronald Reagan entertainment POTUS went way too far. It was more attractive to mock and insult "the others" with Tweet-length one-line shit-talk in America than stand up for education, teaching, media ecology literacy. Rephrased: "Was more important on Reddit and Bluesky in year 2025 to own MAGA and remind Trump supporters that they’re inferior to Intelligent Americans (leopards ate your face, LOL mocking), apparently". Putin won, Surkov won since March 2013.  ===:::
