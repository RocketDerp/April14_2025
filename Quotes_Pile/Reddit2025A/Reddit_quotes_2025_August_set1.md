"Celebrate what? It doesn't change anything Vance just takes over, people really need to stop thinking all this crazy is Trump, he is a result not a cause. Remember the 77 million people that voted for him are still going to support the madness regardless of the figure head."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  At heart, there is a failure to recognize Mass Man behaviors. Marshall McLuhan of University of Toronto defines the term Mass Man realtive tomedia. A common attraction or repulsion to certain media can create aa group thinking or mob mentality. The confomity and peer pressure that arrises from common external stimulation or information. Cults, religions, even how people behave on one media platform vs.another (or the same media content on a small smartphone screen vs. large cinema). The heart-strings and puppet-strings that media content itself can induce in us, that has become the basis of political parties and warfare. We have reached religion depths and beyond. ===:::

"Oh, it doesn't matter anymore. JD Vance is just the puppet for Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin, and once he's in power they will declare a state of emergency and cancel the elections. They've all but said that that's how they plan on really remaking the country. 25th-ing Trump has been in the cards all along. Once Trump is gone they will roll back the tariffs to appease the base, who will go back to insisting everything is going swimmingly, while also rolling back civil rights and basic freedoms for everyone else at an even more rapid pace."

"He spent years on television perfecting his bulsh#t generator, perhaps surprised at what he could get away with. When he claimed Obama was from Africa and it actually stuck with the low information voters, I think that gave him the validation that he could do anything he wanted with that talent.

Not just MAGA, not just Trump suppoters, but anyone who can not see past the Levant religion sytems of thousands of years ago that they have had zero education on how they operate on the human brain. "They say more about Deuteronomy than about **women**. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, **love and compassion are reserved for the in-group**, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy." - Skywalker Ranch interviews, summer of 1986, Power of Myth book. ===:::

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Look, I know to most people I am tedious and boring and repetitive on these subjects. But you have got to take the Levant 3-way monomyth crisis seriously, everything in (former White House director) Bill Moyers interviews at Skywalker Ranch in 1986, 1987, published in "Power of Myth". This was a key to my December 2009 prediction of the Arab Spring in North Africa, a year before it became world famous via Tunisia. Religions ar fiction, extremely compelling fiction that induce compulsive group peer pressure and behaviors. This mocking you see is fiction storytelling. You have to take everything ever written or recorded by [Peter Pomerantsev... and focus on what he published (and linked video) 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4) seriously and see the group behavior patterns play out before Donald Trump's 2015 run for POTUS. And all the perspectives of Neil Postman 1985, 1992, 1995, and even his earlier work. Essentially, how people behave when they don't understand or comprehend reality. Bring in Carl Sagan 1995 on that. The whole world, all geography, all time periods, *turns to fiction* and is avoidant of non-mythological non-fiction. As Sagan said, sooner or later this is going to blow up in our face with the technology humanity has. MAGA is mocking "liberals", while not cross-referencing their own fiction desires to the Taliban via Malala. And now anyone not MAGA in USA is mocking MAGA / Trump. What Russia has "won" is self-destruction of all humanity in out-group feedback loops, Russia is not in control, Russian leaders are compulsively addicted to the monomyth fiction patterns they mined. And now ChatGPT and other LLM / AI systems have trained on this. ===:::

"It's delusional to think Trump is the one going to need flee the country money. He's the one who has solidified executive power and replaced all the military and intelligence agencies top brass with kowtowing loyalists. It's everyone else who's going to need to flee the country. What mechanism do you propose will be used to oust him and force him to go on the run...?"

"It is actually terrifying howv the US voters treat the election of the most powerful Office in the world as a sports match where you are for team blue or red and just want to win complete disregarding any policy or morals about who they vote for.

The way trump behaves and is treated like a narcissistic barbaric king by his voters, politicians and us companies is actually terrifying for me as a European. This kind of stuff is straight up bribery and seeing this happen without any meaningful outcry, let alone a reaction by the republican party shoes that US democracy is dead. There is no room for other voices left, no room for compromis and no room for doubt or choose changes. There is just a obnoxiously bad behaving elderly king and no one cult following either to zealous or to cowardice to see they are destroying US democracy, it's values and eventually it's safety"

This was *Trump*'s Justice department trying to incite civilians to further violence. There was no shadow government, there was no Biden or Obama pulling the strings, it was all Trump, all along.

I was a certified teacher for Microsoft products, I taught Microsoft employees in Redmond Washington. I have studied this attraction to fiction first hand, I am a published author and technical editor of computer books (including social media books). You can't just leave it to chance that people know fiction attraction, you have to take Neil Postman's library of books seriously, especially his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and make sure EVERY PERSON age 12 to age 120 understands media ecology. Mosque, Mecca, Church, Roman Empire, Putin/Surkov Russia... is the evidence of how this ability to distinguish fiction from nonfiction is essential to a functining democracy.

"It's all about ego and "winning"

That's all Christianity is, too. The first commandment itself pushes the fact that literally all other religions are wrong and that their God is the single most important thing in the universe, which is why it's being a "good Christian" to force your religion on everyone under the guise of "saving" them from "hell"

MAGA is a simple repositioning of those philosophies to a man who represents the epitome of "winning" at "all costs", so for the cult to openly admit they know he's not what he claims, means that every single one of his supporters will first have to admit that they are wrong about basically everything at this point.

So, its certainly not about being an actual "Christian", because almost none of them remember what that means by now.

That said, it's not like the church itself isn't full of corruption, greed, coverups, pedophilia, and so on..

Ultimately, Donald Trump **DOES** represent the religion, because the whole thing is evil."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : **There is no magic. There is no supernatural.** Teaching Media Ecology and Comparative Mythology addresses Fox News, Reddit, Twitter, Bluesky, Facebook, Church, Mosque, Televagelism all in one education. We have not caught up to James Joyce's year 1924 onward publication of Finnegans Wake. "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966 -- "Government approved brainwashing." - PARENT approved. Ask Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan, PARENTS teach the Quran to children, just like USA PARENTS hand over Children to Sunday School. It is education, learning, science fiction story of outer space alien who messages to Earth... a story character named Yahweh and Allah who Bible verse "1 John 4:20" says 2,000 years ago in the Levant - you have NEVER SEEN God, you heve never SEEEN Jesus. ===:::

"Americans are slowly beginning to realize that many of their fellow citizens prefer authoritarianism when it's targeted at people they dislike, and that nothing will dissuade them from that support. And that this very much connects to politics throughout history."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Look at how people behave with the block buttons on social media. If you dislike someone, you have to burn thier books (Nazi Germany 1933 didn't have Unicode text and digital social media, [they had to burn magazines and books they disagreed with by using flame and paper).

"The only reasons they even entertained the whole Epstein shit in the first place is because it very much became part of their Q-Anon shit and all of that is entirely built around a wish for a coming 'cleansing of their political enemies' the Democrats."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Reminder: [We know that QAnon was actively promoted by Russia since November 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/qanon-russia-conspiracy-theory-trump-2020-election-b1536946.html). QAnon fits exactly with [Kremlin "War Against Reality" as described in September 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/), seeding the addiction to fiction and abandoning of nonfiction by society. ===:::

"Hillary Clinton called them deplorables years ago and they melted down. She wasn’t wrong then and it’s even more true now. Republicans haven’t stood for anything other than owning the libs - which is really just a cover for owning minorities, women, and the poor. It’s just time everyone stop listening to their moral grandstanding because it never holds up. The goal posts always move. It’s all projection."

"There is nothing special or different from Americans now and Germans in the 20s and 30s, we are all just people and we still have the capacity for all that shit, always have and always will

Spin people up at the right rpm and push the right buttons and some guy from Oklahoma will stand next to someone from New York as they push people into the gas chambers together.....

We like to think we are somehow different from those people but we arent"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I agree. That is why global study of Comparative Mythology and Media Ecology is essential. We need to view this as a human brain issue, a media content issue, education issue - not a USA domestic political issue. Donald Trump is a force of TCP/IP media and social media reaction commenting. Russia was able to adapt their 2011 media techniques to social media, and now ChatGPT and other large langauge models are able to generate appealing fiction to the whole world. ===:::

"I think I've read enough stories of Trump supporters who had loved ones deported by this admin and still support Trump to know that they support authoritarianism even when it targets people they DO like.

They just don't want to think for themselves. This is the "know-nothings" movement taken to a whole new extreme."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : And AI has been deregulated, defense againt hostile monomyth media invasions from China and Russia have been removed... so it is a predatory world of alternate reality fiction telling people there is a god to follow and worship. Media cults are not educated, so regardless of orgin (or generative AI learning what humans desire, tuned to statisfy audiences)... Donald Trump is just one of many media content providers to come on this trajectory of people having blind faith in fiction. Nonficiton has been abandoned. ===:::

"Not trying to defend the guy but there are probably a lot of low star reviews by people who never ate there and just dont like trump. Im not saying the food dosent also probably suck and is likely the cheapest ingredients you can buy while asking top $ because magats will pay anything to put trumps name in their mouth."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : [Everything is media ecology](../../Media_Ecology/Everything_is_ME.md) the *opposition to MAGA / Trump White House* easily adopts fiction. False ratings, fighting fiction with fiction drowns the whole world. Sports mentality breeds paranoia in population. The high road is being serious and rescuing hearts and minds. Fiction is coming from sources all over, not just the obvious Donald Trump sources. The Middle East has been drowning fiction with fiction for thousands of years, that is the "Old World Order" in the Great Seal USA meaning. ===:::

"I think some immigrants are doing things like this ONLY because they think it will make them safe. When Trump was first elected, a Wendy’s employee who appeared southern Asian approached me while I was in Army uniform. He seemed like he was trying to prove his patriotism. In my head I was like, “Dude I wanted Bernie you’re cool.” Every time I was at that Wendy’s in uniform he had to express how totally ok he was with the new administration. I would have loved to be able to tell him he had no reason to worry but all I could was try to show him some positivity because I knew he had readon to worry"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : I think many who disagree with MAGA and disagree with Fox News and disagree with Donald Trump think adding more absurd surreal mocking to a **Total Mockery White House** is the anser. They do not take media ecology seriously from Canadain Marshall McLuhan and New Yorker Neil Postman... nor do they recall [Peter Pomerantsev's 2014 writings on the subject](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/), eating the Surkovian onions. The faith in mocking, insulting, and **blowing minds via surreal Mockery White House** is the MAGA and Kremlin faith. Adopting faith in mocking is joining with MAGA's media movement. It is the opposite of Irish author James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, which is all about a society-wide "Wake" of the Finnegans of society, "Media Woke" to patterns of media ecology. ===:::

"Reminds me of that scene from Schindler’s List where the Jewish guy is frantically trying to convince the Nazi soldiers he’s one of the good ones while they all laugh at him.

Can’t fix stupid"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : the social media message here is: give up on Americans, abandon education, abandon learning, give one-line Twitter reaction tracks let Russia win against NATO... "Can’t fix stupid". People observe that Fox News creates stupid, but won't concede that education can actaully address stupid. But memes and junk media all over social media is drowning out serious. USA society will continue to decline if people are not attracted to nonfiction. ===:::
