"Celebrate what? It doesn't change anything Vance just takes over, people really need to stop thinking all this crazy is Trump, he is a result not a cause. Remember the 77 million people that voted for him are still going to support the madness regardless of the figure head."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary :  At heart, there is a failure to recognize Mass Man behaviors. Marshall McLuhan of University of Toronto defines the term Mass Man realtive tomedia. A common attraction or repulsion to certain media can create aa group thinking or mob mentality. The confomity and peer pressure that arrises from common external stimulation or information. Cults, religions, even how people behave on one media platform vs.another (or the same media content on a small smartphone screen vs. large cinema). The heart-strings and puppet-strings that media content itself can induce in us, that has become the basis of political parties and warfare. We have reached religion depths and beyond. ===:::

"Oh, it doesn't matter anymore. JD Vance is just the puppet for Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin, and once he's in power they will declare a state of emergency and cancel the elections. They've all but said that that's how they plan on really remaking the country. 25th-ing Trump has been in the cards all along. Once Trump is gone they will roll back the tariffs to appease the base, who will go back to insisting everything is going swimmingly, while also rolling back civil rights and basic freedoms for everyone else at an even more rapid pace."

"He spent years on television perfecting his bulsh#t generator, perhaps surprised at what he could get away with. When he claimed Obama was from Africa and it actually stuck with the low information voters, I think that gave him the validation that he could do anything he wanted with that talent. It's evil, but of course it's a talent. It will go down as one of the most effective con men in all of history."

"Because feigned conviction is a cheat code. Fake it loud enough and (most) people believe whatever story you sell."
