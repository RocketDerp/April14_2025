# Thrilled at Surkovian Governing

NOTE: Lest you believe I take words like "funny" too literally, not as in "odd" or that people are being sarcastic... I remind you that context of commenting about it on social media, ironically or otherwise, is social media engagement of the Surkovian poison apple kind. Donald Trump's power is making EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY of United States of America life exciting and thrilling what the Hunger Games white men ruling the nation are going to do / say / chaos next. [Electric Torah song from July 1973 applies to Donald Trump MAGA Fox News politics March 2013 onward, Lyrics: *"And for the coup de grace: they're outrageous!"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h-crmBPHb4)

Much of the *thrill* is that *the other group* is trained, predictable - while having zero self-awareness of Russian information warfare / how Putin has been in power for decades. [Eating the Surkovian Onions](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md)

"The midterms are going to be fantastic for this very reason. Democrats and Republican challengers can both pull the “my opponent voted against releasing the Epstein files” card."

"This is a national scandal the likes we have never seen - a genuine pedophile ring being covered up.

Every GOP voted against releasing the files, and most of them are now tweeting as if they didn’t. Be relentless in calling them out, don’t let them change the narrative … hound them everywhere they go."

"It's funny how they've trained them to latch onto conspiracy theories like a German Shepherd while actively engaging in criminal conspiracies themselves. It was only a matter of time until they got bit."

"It cracks me up that they are trying to make this a both sides argument when each side is clearly voting differently."

"Most people need to understand that his rabid base is only 10-20% of the voting block. Most independents that voted for him are long gone and many “Republicans” jumped shipped months ago and are jumping ship over this Epstein crap.

Encourage everyone to vote democrat during the midterms and grab the popcorn! It’ll be entertaining to watch Trump actually get impeached and convicted."

Front page of Reddit Friday July 18, 2025. Chuckleheads who think every thing is a joke comedy (Donald Trump as Tony Clifton) that MAGA, Elon Musk, Donald Trump does is thrilling Reality TV (The Apprentice) entertainment, that Russian Surkov methods of government are so fun and enjoyable to keep smartphones vibrating with notificaitons to stimulate the poor people in the USA - that nobody desires to stand up and preach, quoteing Peter Pomerantsev from 2014 or Andrew Postman from February 2017... because the addiction to the antics, mocking, total mockery is such that people do not wish to remove the absurd surreal comedy entertainers (Musk, Trump, White House, Putin, JD Vance, etc).
