# Thrilled at Surkovian Governing

NOTE: Lest you believe I take words like "funny" too literally, not as in "odd" or that people are being sarcastic... I remind you that context of commenting about it on social media, ironically or otherwise, is social media engagement of the Surkovian poison apple kind. Donald Trump's power is making EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY of United States of America life exciting and thrilling what the Hunger Games white men ruling the nation are going to do / say / chaos next. [Electric Torah song frm July 1973 applies to Donald Trump MAGA Fox News politics, lyrics: *"And for the coup de grace: they're outrageous!"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h-crmBPHb4)

"The midterms are going to be fantastic for this very reason. Democrats and Republican challengers can both pull the “my opponent voted against releasing the Epstein files” card."

"This is a national scandal the likes we have never seen - a genuine pedophile ring being covered up.

Every GOP voted against releasing the files, and most of them are now tweeting as if they didn’t. Be relentless in calling them out, don’t let them change the narrative … hound them everywhere they go."

"It's funny how they've trained them to latch onto conspiracy theories like a German Shepherd while actively engaging in criminal conspiracies themselves. It was only a matter of time until they got bit."
