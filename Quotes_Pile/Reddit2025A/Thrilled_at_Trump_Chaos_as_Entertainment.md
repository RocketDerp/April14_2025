# Thrilled at Surkovian Governing

NOTE: Lest you believe I take words like "funny" too literally, not as in "odd" or that people are being sarcastic... I remind you that context of commenting about it on social media, ironically or otherwise, is social media engagement of the Surkovian poison apple kind. Donald Trump's power is making EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY of United States of America life exciting and thrilling with the Hunger Games white men ruling the nation are going to do / say / chaos next. [Electric Torah song from July 1973 applies to Donald Trump MAGA Fox News politics March 2013 onward, Lyrics: *"And for the coup de grace: they're outrageous!"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h-crmBPHb4)

Much of the *thrill* is that *the other group* is trained, predictable - while having zero self-awareness of Russian information warfare / how Putin has been in power for decades. [Eating the Surkovian Onions](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md)

Chuckleheads who think every thing is a joke comedy (Donald Trump as Tony Clifton) that MAGA, Elon Musk, Donald Trump does is thrilling Reality TV (The Apprentice) entertainment, that Russian Surkov methods of government are so fun and enjoyable to keep smartphones vibrating with notifications to stimulate the poor people in the USA - that nobody desires to stand up and preach, quoting Peter Pomerantsev from 2014 or Andrew Postman from February 2017... because the addiction to the antics, mocking, total mockery is such that people do not wish to remove the absurd surreal comedy entertainers (Musk, Trump, White House, Putin, JD Vance, etc).

Mocking and insulting is not resisting, it is exactly what Surkovian governing / Russian information warfare exploits in the human mind and brain... out-group hate patterns. Instead of teaching Jen Senko, Neil Postman, Andrew Postman, Peter P - people use social machine systems to promote mocking and insulting (which are MAGA / Donald Trump values) in July 2025.

Something to be happy would be Connor adopting compassion comprehension, learning better morality. Instead, people "love it" that a human has been mind-fucked by the wealthy and powerful... which is in no way something good for humanity. USA society has such a low bar: "liberal tears" as the bar people have, "conservative tears" are the low bar of measure people have in July 2025. There is no high road, only total mockery. Russia won, Surkov won since March 2013.

Rupert Murdoch has been mind-fucking Americans since 1996 with Fox News, then the Internet Research Agency in Russia and Cambridge Analytica joined together in late 2012 to mind-fuck in more diverse and deeper ways. And the comments on Reddit in that posting about "eating themselves alive" - this is self-harm of USA directed by a enemy, Russia. This isn't asserting goodness, this is what you get more than a dozen years of mental and emotional manipulation for Americans to hate Americans. This is self-harm on a mass mind scale, [mass psychosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M). Science isn't being adopted, it's bullshit lust for private jet and private islands wealthy men topics.

People are not addressing the underlying cause: *why do people trust computer screens so blindly, The ELIZA effect*, why do people trust Donald Trump? Why are people attracted to terrorism and out-group killing in Israel and Palestine... why does Russia think war against Ukraine since February 2014, more than a full decade, is good for their future? Why are people so convinced badness itself (Donald Trump) is good for the future? Humanity has not developed education and defense against propaganda / cults / Rupert Murdoch Fox News - this is nothing to be happy about or cheer on. We need to be focused on the problem of people's attraction to fiction media content, Fox News attraction, Donald Trump attraction, Elon Musk Twitter attraction, etc.

Why are people not willing to be serious and quote these authors and people who stand up for goodness itself and put an end to this Tulsi Gabbard / Donald Trump / RFK Jr / JD Vance / Putin / Kremlin bullshit, War Against Reality? People are too entertained and addicted to the Surkovian absurd surreal mental exploits. Neil Postman 1985 "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is essential for everyone age 12 to 120 in this situation we are living under.

People are eating right out of Surkovian onion garden of fiction. “The first thing the President had done when he came to power in 2000 was to seize control of television. It was television through which the Kremlin decided which politicians it would ‘allow’ as its puppet opposition, what the country’s history and fears and consciousness should be. And the new Kremlin won’t make the same mistake the old Soviet Union did: it will never let TV become dull. The task is to synthesise Soviet control with Western entertainment. Twenty-first-century Ostankino mixes show business and propaganda, ratings with authoritarianism. And at the centre of the great show is the President himself" - **year 2014, more than a decade ago** - Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia

YouTube 2025 entertainment of watching ICE arrests as action hyper-reality social media. With audience laugh tracks and mocking tracks in the YouTube comment sections.

Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University, 1993: "[Hyperreality of course affects us across many different, ah, spectrums. And it’s built on the real. It is not as though the hyperreal could get by without injections of reality in it. It requires – and this is not a principle from Baudrillard but one that I have realised from watching a lot of television – you have to have injections of reality in order to keep the images afloat, occasionally. In fact one of the new, ah, strategies adopted by television – and it serves two functions, one is a cost function – are these reality shows. They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated."](https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/)

Year 2014: [“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests — and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)

This isn't a court trial, this is just a list of Epstein clients (information strip tease), that in itself is not proof of crimes, only association.

For the constant stream of lies and emotional manipulation, the constant mind-fucking of the population. Media addiction itself needs to be confronted, Fox News needs to be confronted, bullshit itself needs to be confronted. Donald Trump being in the White House is a massive symptom. Did [we learn NOTHING from the COVID-19 pandemic about people believing and trusting liars](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192), and we think RFK Jr isn't a threat with measles and other diseases? These are FACTUAL PROVABLE crimes against We The People, ignoring science medical in favor of lies and falsehoods to manipulate the population. The entire society needs to *sober up* from the media high of constantly mocking and insulting Donald Trump and face up to media addiction and Russian information warfare methods.

There is PLENTY that people in USA can be doing to MAGA believers / Trump supporters. Instead of using social media to describe the problem over and over since year 2016, we can start teaching cult deprogramming quotes from the hundreds of cult books in the public library... on social media. We can start teaching media ecology on social media, instead of just LOL LMAO at how Russian information warfare since March 2013 has won the hearts and minds of Americans (to self-harm the USA) - We The People can actually get off our social media ass and start **defending** with intellectual weapons in a war of intellect against the Kremlin. The *compulsive* adoption of Donald Trump's technique of name-calling and insulting reveals we have been manipulated to adopt Donald Trump's very communications techniques... instead of eliminate them, this is reveling in Trumpism.

"Holy shit. Does anyone know if there's a physical backup of the original?

Edit: guys, that was not a serious question. It was a joke. The original is physical, not digital. Please stop informing me that pocket editions exist."

Every absurd and surreal act by the Trump White House is comedy to an audience who will not stop entertainment. Compulsive reactions. Joking about the Constitution. Trump feeds this audience who secretly desires for him to be in place for one-line jokes (this is a single line: "Holy shit. Does anyone know if there's a physical backup of the original?" to make light of the heavy deep-shit situation). People keep promoting guns and violent uprising, but not willing to actually make a written letter or grievances to rally behind. And that means specific items, not *people* only. Deep ideals, such as teaching cult deprogramming and education about Russia information warfare. Not just making this about figureheads alone, but We The People who are the source of power. **We are living in [Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest), and have been since March 2013 when Russia started exporting their Surkovian information warfare, the constant mockery and joking centered around MAGA and Trump and Ukraine war since February 2014 how "Russia is a failure" joking.**

"Never change" is repeated in the image and the Reddit posting title. Sarcasm and absurd are being exploited by Rupert Murdoch media empire, this is predatory mass media of making the media consumption audience believe they are more clever than Rupert Murdoch's content creators, this is Eating the Surkovian onions. Calling them Geniuses and saying "checkers when it is 16D chess" is exactly what Surkovian governing is all about. Absurd, surreal mind exploits. Social media users (here on two platforms in this posting) are eating right out of the hands of Rupert Murdoch's adaption of Russian information warfare techniques. The audience is thrilled at the insulting and mocking, insincerity and falsehoods, the paradox brain exploits, of joining the Donald Trump Total Mockery White House anti-reality media. Nothing short of a total society wide, age 12 to 120, voters and non-voters alike - teaching of 1985 book by New York University's Neil Postman titled "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is likely to start to solve this problem. It is not optional in a world driven by Internet media that people have no self-awareness of the history of global comparative mythology and fiction vs. nonfiction favoring.

Donald Trump inspires people to abandon nonfiction, Donald Trump inspires people to adopt hate. Exactly what Putin and Surkov schemed up in 2012. Fox News was already fiction content, and people keep begging for more future episodes. Because faith in mocking is the Rupert Murdoch faith, faith in mocking reality as boring is the MAGA faith.

"The one thing that breaks conservatives faster than anything else is mockery and laughter. Mock them. Laugh at them. Watch them wilt. It always works. Always. That’s why they spit blood when Walz called them weird."

Always works. Absolute faith. The entire concept of a nation in meme stupor like Middle East is over fiction vs fiction not grasped at all. Oh Yha, Walz sure won by calling them weird, really won the information warfare and returned people to favoring nonfiction in year 2024. The Donald Trump MAGA show has been gong on for over a decade, Putin has been using war against reality with Ukraine and other nations. We are "Amusing Ourselves To Death" with White House entertainment and South Park entertainment and memes on social machines. As described by Neil Postman in his 1985 book. If we can't get people to actually stand up for authentic reality and nonfiction, it will be mythology after mythology.

"Love watching this show. He absolutely hates trump and his descriptions of trump are so funny."

Make no mistake to anyone outside USA in the future trying to make sense of this. Neil Postman was correct in year 1985 with book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", a nonfiction book originating in Donald Trump's Home Town, New York City / New York University. This is USA sense of entertainment and humor, that politics is a sports mentality with "winner take all", and very few on media sustain challenge of this. Those in the business of selling their own popularity and content don't want people to recognize the impact of media ecology literacy on society. There is a concept in society that every poor person dreams they may become a billionaire, but also many educated people hope they will become a best selling author or comedian or musician or other media star - because as Donald Trump has said outright: once you are a media star, you can grab people. We have witnessed our own personal friends admire famous people in that way our whole lifetime, infatuation with an author / fashion / style / tone / language / of someone. USA of 2025 was built on Hollywood as the most powerful education and teaching system, music industry / film industry / entertainment industry. The next year after publication of Neil Postman's 1985 "Amusing Ourselves To Death", in California the filming at Skywalker Ranch started for "Power of Myth" - explaining how fiction mythology storytelling hasn't just created the success of George Lucas at the peak of his power in 1986... but the Middle East religions of the Torah / Bible / Quran fiction storytelling and Mecca Quran theme park.

Matthew 4:19 Jesus Freaks being cheered on for adopting trolling sort of mindset, that always more trolling fixes the problem, always more absurd, always more anti-reality surreal. Without anyone on Reddit and Bluesky calling out that [**this article in September 2014, more than a FULL DECADE AGO** describes it as Russian information warfare, anti-reality](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/), anti-truth, fiction vs. nonfiction.

Spare time and free time to use social media to comment about how funny it is that Donald Trump is so terrible and awful that "hot take" isn't even hot enough!

The lawmaker who pushed the Trump Derangement Syndrome was arrested for soliciting a minor. Trump appointed the convicted pedophile Lawrence Taylor to a kids' health and wellness program. Multiple J6ers who were pardoned were arrested shortly after for child sexual abuse crimes.

But yunno, Biden kissed his granddaughter in a slightly less-weird way than how Tom Brady made his son kiss him."

Fetishment of rich men's sexual power and wealth power to be a super-star and *grab women by the pussy* and manipulate the society.

As Joseph Campbell said in summer of 1987 at age 83, "die for a metaphor", in our case the fiction metaphor is Donald Trump being able to say:

What we are living under in August 2025, is what Neil Postman wrote about and described in 1985: “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

And Neil Postman wasn't even describing it as information warfare, he saw it happening as a natural product of electric media consumption, he was clear on this: "In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result." - 1985

What Surkov has done with Putin / Kremlin since year 2000 was *intentional*, weaponized, and exported with Cambridge Analytica since Q2 2013.

"the dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites now down to 10 seconds or less, lowest-common-denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but [especially a kind of celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE).” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

"I enjoyed the many times he said what a Senator was “crazy talk” and “just made that up”. The level of combativeness with Democrats and many Republicans was next level. They could probably impeach him just on the way he was freaking out trying to answer questions. It doesn’t take any fancy footwork when your testimony is all true, because it never changes and can’t negate itself. But these MAGA/MAHA liars are running back and forth trying to hold onto the thread that (loosely at best) ties their lies together. I thought he might hyperventilate a few times."

People enjoy that Donald Trump has created new channels of constant entertainment. Suprise and shock fiction drama as a way of governing provides stimulation for audiences.

Meme addiction society constantly craves personalized content. In the future, artificail intelligence (AI) will be able to create custom versions of Trump for every person in society, just to the song preferences of each media addict. Trump inspires constant egoism, a society driven by egomania. Right now we are at the satage of AI generating this Cracker Barrel video for mass society, but dynamic rewrites will be possible where peopel can change the song and dance to fit their personal inner desires (fetish).
