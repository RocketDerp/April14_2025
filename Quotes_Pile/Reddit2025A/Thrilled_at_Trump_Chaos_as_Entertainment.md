# Thrilled at Surkovian Governing

NOTE: Lest you believe I take words like "funny" too literally, not as in "odd" or that people are being sarcastic... I remind you that context of commenting about it on social media, ironically or otherwise, is social media engagement of the Surkovian poison apple kind. Donald Trump's power is making EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY of United States of America life exciting and thrilling what the Hunger Games white men ruling the nation are going to do / say / chaos next. [Electric Torah song from July 1973 applies to Donald Trump MAGA Fox News politics March 2013 onward, Lyrics: *"And for the coup de grace: they're outrageous!"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h-crmBPHb4)

Much of the *thrill* is that *the other group* is trained, predictable - while having zero self-awareness of Russian information warfare / how Putin has been in power for decades. [Eating the Surkovian Onions](Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md)

"This is a national scandal the likes we have never seen - a genuine pedophile ring being covered up.

Every GOP voted against releasing the files, and most of them are now tweeting as if they didn’t. Be relentless in calling them out, don’t let them change the narrative … hound them everywhere they go."

"Most people need to understand that his rabid base is only 10-20% of the voting block. Most independents that voted for him are long gone and many “Republicans” jumped shipped months ago and are jumping ship over this Epstein crap.

Encourage everyone to vote democrat during the midterms and grab the popcorn! It’ll be entertaining to watch Trump actually get impeached and convicted."

Front page of Reddit Friday July 18, 2025. Chuckleheads who think every thing is a joke comedy (Donald Trump as Tony Clifton) that MAGA, Elon Musk, Donald Trump does is thrilling Reality TV (The Apprentice) entertainment, that Russian Surkov methods of government are so fun and enjoyable to keep smartphones vibrating with notificaitons to stimulate the poor people in the USA - that nobody desires to stand up and preach, quoteing Peter Pomerantsev from 2014 or Andrew Postman from February 2017... because the addiction to the antics, mocking, total mockery is such that people do not wish to remove the absurd surreal comedy entertainers (Musk, Trump, White House, Putin, JD Vance, etc).

"Yeah this shit cracks me up. Everyone acts like this is some new thing and the Epstein files are the smoking gun. Dude is a convicted felon. He took classified documents to his personal residence. He raped someone… like yeah is this bad, sure. But there is plenty of evidence of him already being a predator without it."

Reddit front page. Gleeful that people are mentally manipulated by [Elon Musk mind virus / billionaires manipulating](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/13/elon-musk-s-ambition-repopulating-the-planet-and-destroying-the-woke-virus_6714239_4.html) the population. Mocking and insulting is not resisting, it is exactly what Surkovian governing / Russian information warfare exploits in the human mind and brain... out-group hate patterns. Instead of teaching Jen Senko, Neil Postman, Andrew Postman, Peter P - people use social machine systems to promote mocking and insulting (which are MAGA / Donald Trump values) in July 2025.

Something to be happy would be Connor adopting compassion comprehension, learning better morality. Instead, people "love it" that a human has been mind-fucked by the wealthy and powerful... which is in no way something good for humanity. USA society has such a low bar: "liberal tears" as the bar people have, "conservative tears" are the low bar of measure people have in July 2025. There is no high road, only total mockery. Russia won, Surkov won since March 2013.

"Clever comebacks" framing of subreddit name, "Little cute innocent (psychology that children are not responsible for adult choices) Donnie Trump" framing, amused at Donald Trump, entertained at Donald Trump. It isn't funny, because **every social media user in USA is unable to cite** in July 2025: Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev, Andrew Postman, Neil Postman. People without self-awareness of what [Donald Trump Medium does to their brains](https://autistics.life/@RoundSparrow/114908848841690331). “In psychological warfare, the weak points are flaws in how people think. If you’re trying to hack a person’s mind, you need to identify cognitive biases and then exploit them.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, 2019. For USA, that is absurd surreal comedy brain exploits, Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton compusively, without self-awareness. That's the entire point of "Amusing Ourselves To Death" 1985 book.... the lack of self-awareness.

Rupert Murdoch has been mind-fucking Americans since 1996 with Fox News, then the Internet Research Agency in Russia and Cambridge Analytica joined together in late 2012 to mind-fuck in more diverse and deeper ways. And the comments on Reddit in that posting about "eating themselves alive" - this is self-harm of USA directed by a enemy, Russia. This isn't asserting goodness, this is what you get more than a dozen years of mental and emotional manipulation for Americans to hate Americans. This is self-harm on a mass mind scale, mass pcyhosis. Science isn't being adopted, it's bullshit lust for private jet and private islands wealthy men topics.

People are not addressing the underlying cause: *why do people trust computer screens so blindly, The ELIZA effect*, why do people trust Donald Trump? Why are people attracted to terrorism and out-group killing in Israel and Palestine... why does Russia think war against Ukraine since February 2014, more than a full decade, is good for their future? Why are people so convinced badness itself (Donald Trump) is good for the future? Humanity has not developed education and defense against propaganda / cults / Rupert Murdoch Fox News - this is nothing to be happy about or cheer on. We need to be focused on the problem of people's attraction to fiction media content, Fox News attraction, Donald Trump attraction, Elon Musk Twitter attraction, etc.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1m8d40j/tulsi_gabbards_new_clinton_conspiracy_is_debunked/

Why is Surkov not a household name in USA? Why is Jen Senko not a household name? Why is Christopher Wylie, Peter Pomerantsev not household names? Why are people not willing to be serious and quote these authors and people who stand up for goodness itself and put an end to this Tulsi Gabbard / Donald Trump / RFK Jr / JD Vance / Putin / Kremlin bullshit, War Against Reality? People are too entertained and addicted to the Surkovian absurd surreal mental exploits. Neil Postman 1985 "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is essential for everyone age 12 to 120 in this situation we are living under. Somebody is going to create an artificial intelligence meme-speak system to generate crap beyond this debunked Kremlin stuff about Clinton... that is even more dangerous with fiction than Donald Trump!

And should be tried for treason for saying Trump was on it. But the Clinton’s are on it and need to be held to accountable because it’s real.

Funny, hilarious, entertaining, Reality TV - sex lives of rich and famous... The Apprentice Reality TV star. People are eating right out of Surkovian onion garden of fiction. “The first thing the President had done when he came to power in 2000 was to seize control of television. It was television through which the Kremlin decided which politicians it would ‘allow’ as its puppet opposition, what the country’s history and fears and consciousness should be. And the new Kremlin won’t make the same mistake the old Soviet Union did: it will never let TV become dull. The task is to synthesise Soviet control with Western entertainment. Twenty-first-century Ostankino mixes show business and propaganda, ratings with authoritarianism. And at the centre of the great show is the President himself" - **year 2014, more than a decade ago** - Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia

"The Apprentice" is fiction, he already knows fiction and cheating out-sells authentic "sleep Joe" Biden nonfiction.

YouTube 2025 entertainment of watching ICE arrests as action hyper-reality social media. With audience laugh tracks and mocking tracks in the YouTube comment sections.

Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University, 1993: "[Hyperreality of course affects us across many different, ah, spectrums. And it’s built on the real. It is not as though the hyperreal could get by without injections of reality in it. It requires – and this is not a principle from Baudrillard but one that I have realised from watching a lot of television – you have to have injections of reality in order to keep the images afloat, occasionally. In fact one of the new, ah, strategies adopted by television – and it serves two functions, one is a cost function – are these reality shows. They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated."](https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/)

Year 2014: [“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)
