So, it got some flare and I honestly didn’t expect it: I just needed a place to vent tbh.

No, im not a bot. Yes, I had a very shit life growing up, however my trauma doesn’t make me a burden. I went to therapy, and got better. I learned that life is so much more then what happened to me, and I just entered the dating life since my ex and I broke up. This was the first guy I met and it seemed to go really well

Yes, I’ve never met the aunt before, however he talks about her non stop and I’ve heard her voice before, so I recognized it.

Yes, none of his family is close by. It’s roughly 2 1/2-3 hours, but he makes the drive out there constantly, at least once a week.

Yes, I have two other inhalers that are LOW. He has my good inhaler, the brand new one with an insane amount of puffs. I left it there because I was constantly over there and my asthma would flare up at his house

No, I didn’t get wasted and said things I didn’t need to be saying. I wanted to be presentable, so I only had two drinks. I have no issue with us breaking up, yes im hurt and confused, but I know to respect that. I kinda lost my shit there and went crazy because I got blocked on everything immediately after he kissed me goodbye and said he was falling in love with me

I also pay out of pocket for my inhaler, im 22 with no insurance. I’m poor lol so I wanted it back

Someone said my ages in my posts don’t add up. I’m 22, May 28th 03 baby. My post about me being 19 was before my 20th birthday. So the timeline adds up

Any “discrepancies” is just because this shit is bizarre.

Yes, his aunt said this situation was mentally draining and said that she thought I was lying about being pregnant/having an abortion. She said it was exhausting for what he went through, and that it hurts more that I “lied”. I did not.

I haven’t left out a single thing, im open and honest. If I knew I fucked up, I would have opened up to it like an adult. Nothing happened with his friend, his friend openly said he liked me and my now ex together. Imagine how hurt and confused im feeling, especially after an abortion. And all the things he said and did.

I can’t get a new inhaler without seeing my doctor first. I’m 22, and poor. I’ve been out of work since the procedure because I’ve had complications. So I have to go see my doctor before I can get a new inhaler, and I legit don’t have insurance (fight in progress right now), so if anyone wants to help cover the doctors appointment/inhaler, my cash app is adminjasmin. I can even share proof that that’s where the money is going
