The Media Makes the Society   

Garbage media into human minds, is garbage education and teaching into human minds. Garbage in, garbage out, and people in USA flock to shit garbage junk media. You see it all over /r/All and in every echo chamber you read- people flocking to trash media.

Donald Trump is the product of a clickbait shallow media systems society. Donald Trump at age 79 does not comprehend what memes and symbols he shuffles, he just knows how to draw attention to the worst trash and garbage. Which Jeffrey Epstein is the worst trash and garbage media content and dehumanization use of technology, that attracts the audience of Donald Trump, so Donald Trump instructs the FBI to release the July 7, 2025  "Epstein nothingburger" memo. [Because calling Russia a "nothingburger"/ "hoax" worked before in getting the audience riled up](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/340118-cnns-van-jones-okeefe-russia-nothingburger-video-a-hoax/) and having their minds *reset to avoid being factual and sincere*. The audience can not resist the shit of Donald Trump, the hate of Donald Trump, filling minds with trash and sinking the whole population into Donald Trump behaviors and values.

Donald Trump at age 79 does not comprehend what memes and symbols he shuffles, he just knows to find the fastest and most reactive media delivery systems. Donald Trump knows where to stand and how to arrange icons, symbols, memes to educate and teach to the audience. The meme consumers do the rest, the people of /r/All and every media platform line up to copy and duplicate and distribute the Donald Trump misunderstandings as *content*.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance. As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.” ― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013.

Donald Trump media content, trickle down trash and garbage, is what Carl Sagan was warning us about in year 1995. Three decades later in USA August 2025, it is the foundation of what people in USA feed into their brains.. trash junk lies and falsehoods from Donald Trump.  And we behave as a total nation like people who have consumed such junk trash media. Donald Trump  is a role model of hate and misunderstandings.  Garbage media into human minds, is garbage education and teaching into human minds.

&nbsp;

This is a nation of hell.  Every media platform pumps out shit content to appease an audience that will not face the society-wide every-day all-day attraction to shit ideas and trash concepts. We have learned, aquired, educated ourselves into mental states of craving more Donald Trump trash and shit. Nobody has been able to stop this feedback loop of shit and hate between the USA media consumer audience (Reddit inclusive, Bluesky inclusive, etc, etc) and Donald Trump. We have trashed our nation by means of educating ourselves with Donald Trump content. Trump is our teacher, and we have been attentive students who adopted hate and dehumanization values of the teacher.

That is how teaching works. That is how learning works. Repetitive ideas from Donald trump into our brains.  And the USA shows this brain damage, mass psychosis. 

Instead of sharing Carl Sagan, Malala Yousafzai, Hannah Arendt, and other excellent good content in the face of Donald Trump since year 2015, we in the USA society have flocked to the shit and hate and put them into our minds. That is how education and learning works, and the USA has learned to *become Donald Trump in total*, a nation with attraction to hate and misunderstandings of a 79 year old mind. Junk shit /r/All role model teacher.
