> at the end of the day, they're still just trying to sell you things advertisers are paying them to sell you. Even if those things don't actually match up with your interests.

the real product isn't what they are self-aware they are selling you.

A study of comparative mythology, all history and all geography of fiction storytelling systems will raise self-awareness.

Meta Platforms, Incorporated is selling you the same thing Saudi Arabia Mecca has been selling since year 640. A very dark self-destructive fantasy.

In our case, January 20 2025 you can see the face of Mecca in the front row of  Donald Trump's inauguration. Mark Zuckerberg is there.

What is the Saudi Royal Mecca's success of over 2 billion dedicated subscribers? Hate the out-groups. Hate the infidels.

What is the Donald Trump Experience that Mark Zuckerberg has mastered selling you? What is the Joe Rogan experience podcast? Hate the out-group. Hate those people who speak a different language and eat different food and have different [clothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEm3Kx7bAxo) and different sports team and different favorite sports player and different hair styles and different skin color, different interpretation, different gender, different flags. As long as hate motivates you.

James Joyce in 1924 started  publishing the equations and formulas on all this.  He titled his book "Wake up you zombie meme-slave fucking Finnegans" - the [Zombies of Dublin Ireland, Wake up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ejga4kJUts)!

The people selling Mecca out-group hate and the people selling Donald Trump out-group hate are not awake to what they are doing at the Finnegans Wake level. They are not self-aware. All they know is that it concentrates power and wealth. They do not realizing that concentrating power and wealth in Saudi Arabia is a mistake and error. They do not grasp comparative mythology.

Mecca the old Meta media venue   

James Joyce released  the last pages of his book "Finnegans Wake" on Star Wars day in 1939. May the force be with you. A primer was published 30 years later, 1968 by Canadian professor Marshall McLuhan... "War and Peace in the Global Village". May the comparative mythology force be with you, media ecology.

They don't even realize what they are selling to you, the concentrated wealth and power is a big fat warning sign, not a reward.
