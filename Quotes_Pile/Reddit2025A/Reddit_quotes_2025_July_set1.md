"I know I shouldn't be shocked by anything anymore. But it remains unbelievable to me that nobody cared about how horrific this was. Not to mention everything else. When he made fun of a disabled person and nobody cared, I knew it was over."

"Nice, very persuasive argument. Lol he's right though. Everyone has known this for almost 10 years now except Reddit leftists.

And you wonder why people actually decided Trump was more trustworthy as President than your side.

What am I saying? Keep parroting debunked stuff from 9 years ago."

"I'm very much looking forward to it coming out that he did, in fact, rape a 13 year old (and/or younger) and then the wild bombardment of justification about it to come form the Cult."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : these young Reddit accounts giving "only the other side is a cult" when it is 100% of the population in **media cult** (not to be confused with a cult of a living person, Donald Trump himself as the cult object (which is a smaller cult), but the **cult of media content** created by Trumpism / MAGA / Republicans / right-wing / Putin / Kremlin / White House/ Rupert Murdoch). I really wish I had server-side access to Reddit to see who is upvoting these comments, browser strings, IP addresses, timestamps, account interaction of voting / reply comparisons... If you can't scream Neil Postman / Andrew Postman / Peter Pomerantsev / Adam Curtis / Marshall McLuhan / Rick Roderick / Mythology / Surkovian - [you too might be in a media cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybe_You%27ve_Been_Brainwashed_Too) without self-awareness (and a drunkard can be self-aware he is a drunk, Rick Roderick 1993 admitted so). What we have is out-group hating upon out-group. [Hate corrupts minds](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md), just look at the Holocaust and Middle East conflicts of out-group hate media consumption (Quran media vs. Bible media vs. Torah media vs. nonfiction media). Reddit comment saying "I'm very much looking forward to it coming out" also makes this about information strip tease (which will go on for years), not about removing the fiction-based White House, but addiciton to content, looking forward for more Donald Trump content. ===:::

" The difference between Trump and every other recent GOP President. If someone had alleged this about Ford, Reagan, or either Bush, it would've been dismissed out of hand. But with Trump, the response is, "Yeah, it could happen." "

"That’s the part I don’t get. If Jesus died for all of our sins and they think being gay is a sin…then JC got them covered yo.

As far as I know there are only 4 unforgivable sins. Rejecting god, hardening of the heart, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit and not showing forgiveness.

So by the Bible’s own standards. Rejecting gay people covers 3 of the four unforgivable sins.

Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit by attributing gays to satan when they are in fact gods children.

Hardening of the heart by simply rejecting them.

Showing no forgiveness basically by default if you harden your heart against people you are denying them any forgiveness to what you perceive as their sin.

So TLDR If you don’t accept gay people you are the person your god warned you not to become."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We won't fix our Bible literacy problem with social media, repeating and repeating and repeating the verses that USA audiences of Church do not grasp or comprehend:  1) John 1:1 God is memes and only memes, language and only language, words and only words. 2) **"1 John 4:20"** - saying *I Love Jesus* is wrong, saying *I love God* is wrong, you have never *seen God* you have only consumed media through your ears and eyes, that is a book, that is words, you are not falling in love with real human beings but poetry itself! Hate of ANY LIVING person is wrong. That verse packs a whollop when paired with John 1:1 that God is words and only words. 3) "1 John 3:17" every social media platform should have made this a constant hashtag since June 2015 when Donald Trump started, and add Elon Musk into the loop too. 4) Romans 11:32 - see Finnegans Wake / James Joyce's entire body of work for exhaustive metaphors on that one. 5) Galatians 3:28 - there is no gender of male or female! Transgender... AOK. 6) Matthew 6:5 - [Donald Trump posing with The Bible June 2020 right before the November 2020 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church)... why the hell can't social media sustain focus of repeating until EVERY Christian in USA knows this verse, age 12 to 120! The Toxic Clergy in USA is sure not teaching Matthew 6:5 over and over regarding that June 2020 photograph opportunity and the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible. ===:::

"There really are no unforgivable sins. Jesus questioned the entire concept of "sins" in the sense the catholic church later made the center of their oppressive death cult.

To Jesus, all humans were born equal and all were the same before god (which makes the concept of a pope look kinda stupid, catholics wasted no time misinterpreting their own scripture). Jesus also "corrected" pretty much the entire old testament, so nothing written in there can be seen as law if it is in conflict with "love thy neighbour". And it is pretty obvious, that "neighbour" means EVERYONE. That is why convicts and enemies are explicitly mentioned.

Hating on gay people is against "love thy neighbour". If a "christian" judges a gay man, they have not understood the story were Jesus protects a prostitute. Showing love and kindness are much important to him than strict morals. And that was 2000 years ago, when society was far less developed.

"Mind your business" is the perfect line here."

&nbsp;

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "There really are no unforgivable sins" - someone who grasps Bible verse Romans 11:32 - there is no Hell, mercy is always the outcome of sin in the Romans 11:32 equation. See Dublin Ireland James Joyce's body of work for langauge proof on verse Romans 11:32. Backed up by Joseph Campbell (New York City, not an Irishman, independent of Joyce). If we can't get MAGA / Fox News audience / Donald Trump fanatics to grasp a 2,000 year old book that is really not that thick, what hope do we have with people interpreting TV shows, films, other books, music lyrics? ===:::

"It always makes me sooooo mad when I see maga complain the media goes after Trump. No honey you dont like when the media actually tells the truth about trump.....when it finally decides to. If biden farted it was headlines for weeks. Trump can crap his own diaper and curse out a handicapped reporter and nothing from the media. One little independent paper will pick it up one tuesday afternoon and no one will see it. Trump gets away with murder. Biden tripped? In the news for weeks even months. Trump tripped entering air force 1 3x already this year and nothing. Not a word. He just as old as biden. Yet not a word on his age or health from the media. Thats all you heard about biden and he can speak and do anything better than trump does."

"All the media downplayed Trump weirdness, his brazenly apparent fascist rhetoric, the Epstein files etc etc. But Biden was old, Kamala didn't have charisma, and Trump would be better for Gaza.. and now I applaud when Colbert got cancelled and other censorship because they got what they deserve.

"Every normal politician has one bad thing the media can harp on every time his or her name is brought up. Every normal presidency has one or two bad problems for the media to focus on. With this guy there’s some horrible new behavior or horrible new problem he’s causing in the country or the world everywhere you can point a camera. Honestly surprised the Epstein thing has such legs given that he’s doing his best to distract from it. Everything from threatening to prosecute Beyoncé to threatening to put the homeless in concentration camps to using Pentagon funds for his private jet to openly cheating at golf. At this point, he might have to start a war."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : This is why you focus on media itself. We have known the Rupert Murdoch Fox News problem. Why is baby boomer Jen Senko not good enough for social media users to repeat and repeat and keep repeating since March 2016 film release? Which is BEFORE November 2016 election. And Neil Postman's book is only 184 pages, get every single person in the nation from age 12 to 120 on the same page of why Fox News is bad, why TV news is bad, why mixing memes in the middle of Bluesky, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok is bad... make this about *technology* and not about *political party*. And then once you get that going... you start to comprehend [what Surkov / Putin / Trump / Cambridge Analytica / Steve Bannon did with Operation Matthew 4:19](../../Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md)... ===:::

"The media and democrats were playing right in the klans’ hands. They were just attacking Joe like he wasn’t trying everything in his power to make it better for us. Joe and his cabinet was fighting tooth and nail against a the senates which are a bunch of bribed klansmen and weak democrats that still barely do shit. The whole country was on the topics of prices and not on the fact the minimum wage in America is has been SO DAMN LOW for ALMOST TWO DECADES NOW.

Inflation was caused by the trumps klan and the epidemic. And don’t sit here and act like the media blamed trump when that’s a damn lie. Biden’s “medical decline” and inflation on eggs was the topic for 4 DAMN YEARS.

I will never blame Joe Biden for the inflation rates, I’ll forever blame the (Christian, “baby loving”, “I’m not racist”) klan and the old ass democrats that was running the senates, the executives. And blame Robert Murdoch’s media empire as well."
