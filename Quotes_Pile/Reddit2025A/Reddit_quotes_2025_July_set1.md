"I know I shouldn't be shocked by anything anymore. But it remains unbelievable to me that nobody cared about how horrific this was. Not to mention everything else. When he made fun of a disabled person and nobody cared, I knew it was over."

"Nice, very persuasive argument. Lol he's right though. Everyone has known this for almost 10 years now except Reddit leftists.

And you wonder why people actually decided Trump was more trustworthy as President than your side.

What am I saying? Keep parroting debunked stuff from 9 years ago."

"I'm very much looking forward to it coming out that he did, in fact, rape a 13 year old (and/or younger) and then the wild bombardment of justification about it to come form the Cult."

:::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : these young Reddit accounts giving "only the other side is a cult" when it is 100% of the population in **media cult** (not to be confused with a cult of a living person, Donald Trump himself as the cult object (which is a smaller cult), but the **cult of media content** created by Trumpism / MAGA / Republicans / right-wing / Putin / Kremlin / White House/ Rupert Murdoch). I really wish I had server-side access to Reddit to see who is upvoting these comments, browser strings, IP addresses, timestamps, account interaction of voting / reply comparisons... If you can't scream Neil Postman / Andrew Postman / Peter Pomerantsev / Adam Curtis / Marshall McLuhan / Rick Roderick / Mythology / Surkovian - [you too might be in a media cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybe_You%27ve_Been_Brainwashed_Too) without self-awareness (and a drunkard can be self-aware he is a drunk, Rick Roderick 1993 admitted so). What we have is out-group hating upon out-group. [Hate corrupts minds](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md), just look at the Holocaust and Middle East conflicts of out-group hate media consumption (Quran media vs. Bible media vs. Torah media vs. nonfiction media). Reddit comment saying "I'm very much looking forward to it coming out" also makes this about information strip tease (which will go on for years), not about removing the fiction-based White House, but addiciton to content, looking forward for more Donald Trump content. ===:::
