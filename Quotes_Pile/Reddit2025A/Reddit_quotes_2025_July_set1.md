"Nice, very persuasive argument. Lol he's right though. Everyone has known this for almost 10 years now except Reddit leftists.

And you wonder why people actually decided Trump was more trustworthy as President than your side.

"I'm very much looking forward to it coming out that he did, in fact, rape a 13 year old (and/or younger) and then the wild bombardment of justification about it to come form the Cult."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : these young Reddit accounts giving "only the other side is a cult" when it is 100% of the population in **media cult** (not to be confused with a cult of a living person, Donald Trump himself as the cult object (which is a smaller cult), but the **cult of media content** created by Trumpism / MAGA / Republicans / right-wing / Putin / Kremlin / White House/ Rupert Murdoch). I really wish I had server-side access to Reddit to see who is upvoting these comments, browser strings, IP addresses, timestamps, account interaction of voting / reply comparisons... If you can't scream Neil Postman / Andrew Postman / Peter Pomerantsev / Adam Curtis / Marshall McLuhan / Rick Roderick / Mythology / Surkovian - [you too might be in a media cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybe_You%27ve_Been_Brainwashed_Too) without self-awareness (and a drunkard can be self-aware he is a drunk, Rick Roderick 1993 admitted so). What we have is out-group hating upon out-group. [Hate corrupts minds](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md), just look at the Holocaust and Middle East conflicts of out-group hate media consumption (Quran media vs. Bible media vs. Torah media vs. nonfiction media). Reddit comment saying "I'm very much looking forward to it coming out" also makes this about information strip tease (which will go on for years), not about removing the fiction-based White House, but addiciton to content, looking forward for more Donald Trump content. ===:::

"That’s the part I don’t get. If Jesus died for all of our sins and they think being gay is a sin…then JC got them covered yo.

As far as I know there are only 4 unforgivable sins. Rejecting god, hardening of the heart, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit and not showing forgiveness.

So by the Bible’s own standards. Rejecting gay people covers 3 of the four unforgivable sins.

Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit by attributing gays to satan when they are in fact gods children.

Hardening of the heart by simply rejecting them.

Showing no forgiveness basically by default if you harden your heart against people you are denying them any forgiveness to what you perceive as their sin.

So TLDR If you don’t accept gay people you are the person your god warned you not to become."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : We won't fix our Bible literacy problem with social media, repeating and repeating and repeating the verses that USA audiences of Church do not grasp or comprehend:  1) John 1:1 God is memes and only memes, language and only language, words and only words. 2) **"1 John 4:20"** - saying *I Love Jesus* is wrong, saying *I love God* is wrong, you have never *seen God* you have only consumed media through your ears and eyes, that is a book, that is words, you are not falling in love with real human beings but poetry itself! Hate of ANY LIVING person is wrong. That verse packs a whollop when paired with John 1:1 that God is words and only words. 3) "1 John 3:17" every social media platform should have made this a constant hashtag since June 2015 when Donald Trump started, and add Elon Musk into the loop too. 4) Romans 11:32 - see Finnegans Wake / James Joyce's entire body of work for exhaustive metaphors on that one. 5) Galatians 3:28 - there is no gender of male or female! Transgender... AOK. 6) Matthew 6:5 - [Donald Trump posing with The Bible June 2020 right before the November 2020 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church)... why the hell can't social media sustain focus of repeating until EVERY Christian in USA knows this verse, age 12 to 120! The Toxic Clergy in USA is sure not teaching Matthew 6:5 over and over regarding that June 2020 photograph opportunity and the $59.99 Donald Trump Bible. ===:::

"There really are no unforgivable sins. Jesus questioned the entire concept of "sins" in the sense the catholic church later made the center of their oppressive death cult.

To Jesus, all humans were born equal and all were the same before god (which makes the concept of a pope look kinda stupid, catholics wasted no time misinterpreting their own scripture). Jesus also "corrected" pretty much the entire old testament, so nothing written in there can be seen as law if it is in conflict with "love thy neighbour". And it is pretty obvious, that "neighbour" means EVERYONE. That is why convicts and enemies are explicitly mentioned.

Hating on gay people is against "love thy neighbour". If a "christian" judges a gay man, they have not understood the story were Jesus protects a prostitute. Showing love and kindness are much important to him than strict morals. And that was 2000 years ago, when society was far less developed.

"Mind your business" is the perfect line here."

&nbsp;

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "There really are no unforgivable sins" - someone who grasps Bible verse Romans 11:32 - there is no Hell, mercy is always the outcome of sin in the Romans 11:32 equation. See Dublin Ireland James Joyce's body of work for langauge proof on verse Romans 11:32. Backed up by Joseph Campbell (New York City, not an Irishman, independent of Joyce). If we can't get MAGA / Fox News audience / Donald Trump fanatics to grasp a 2,000 year old book that is really not that thick, what hope do we have with people interpreting TV shows, films, other books, music lyrics? ===:::

One little independent paper will pick it up one tuesday afternoon and no one will see it. Trump gets away with murder. Biden tripped? In the news for weeks even months.

"The media and democrats were playing right in the klans’ hands. They were just attacking Joe like he wasn’t trying everything in his power to make it better for us. Joe and his cabinet was fighting tooth and nail against a the senates which are a bunch of bribed klansmen and weak democrats that still barely do shit. The whole country was on the topics of prices and not on the fact the minimum wage in America is has been SO DAMN LOW for ALMOST TWO DECADES NOW.

Inflation was caused by the trumps klan and the epidemic. And don’t sit here and act like the media blamed trump when that’s a damn lie. Biden’s “medical decline” and inflation on eggs was the topic for 4 DAMN YEARS.

I will never blame Joe Biden for the inflation rates, I’ll forever blame the (Christian, “baby loving”, “I’m not racist”) klan and the old ass democrats that was running the senates, the executives. And blame Robert Murdoch’s media empire as well."

"That’s something that I don’t think people are understanding about what is going to happen if the files do get out. Right now it’s just strict denial that he had knowledge of what he was up to you. But always the way that these cases go as they will next turn on the girls. Suddenly, these children will be deemed ones that were old souls, or they looked older than they actually were, or they were in places where it would be easy to mistake how old they are. It will become a whole screed about how there are too many expectations on men and are men just supposed to card every woman they come in contact with to ensure that they are 18 before they hit on them?

Not to mention, children that are trafficked are often children who have other issues going on, like drug addiction. There are a reasons why movies like “The Sound of Freedom” do not show the reality of trafficking, and are instead centered on small to cherubic face children. Because the only victims that conservative see as actual victims are perfect victims.

Make no mistake that if the files do come out, it will then turn into a smear campaign against the children that were victimized. And that it was somehow their fault."

"Buddy I’ve been homeless and shouting about this for months now. We’ve known this was happening. I’ve been watching it happen in slow motion.

Food banks near me are already half gutted. The soup kitchens are already serving less food. They took away programs for free government phones so you can’t get one as a homeless person anymore. The police have started harassing me for just sitting at the park in the day time to take a nap. They already took my food stamps and I have been in constant hunger for the last couple weeks and having constant panic attacks wondering what my options even are. I’m terrified to ask strangers for help on the street so I don’t even beg because I worry someone will report me for literally just being too poor to afford a house. I had to mail my ID in to the SS offices to get a new SS card and I’m basically hiding 24/7 until I get my ID back and I can’t even use fucking services until then. States started criminalizing homelessness years ago.

I’m homeless because my parents beat and abused me for a decade until I escaped into college. My dorms closed during Covid and my only option was to go back to the street. I’ve worked as a janitor, in soup kitchens, in factories - doing shit jobs no one else will do - and they don’t even pay enough for me to take care of my medical debt, student loan debt, housing, or anything that might qualify as entertainment.

I don’t feel like I deserve to go to prison because I was set up to fail. I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA and a 35 ACT and took every AP class my school let me.

Yet I can’t get a job because I have no work history and I can’t get work history because I have no work history and now my student loan debt is going to garnish wages from a job even if I did get one.

So I’m homeless. I have no family or friends. I have diabetes and severe anxiety and depression issues.

What do I even look forward to at this point?

I haven’t had food stamps since last month and I’m constantly hungry.

There is nothing to give me hope.

Someone tell me, genuinely, why should I not just kill myself at this point? Genuinely what is the point of fighting and fighting my entire life just to end up here. When can I rest?"

"Realllyy speedrunning Nazi Germany. This was one of the first things they did to "clean up" the country.

Immigrants, minorities, the LBGT community, the homeless, and the handicapped (think about RFK Jr trying to make a list of autistic people) were rounded up for forced labor, sterilization, or worse.

That was only the beginning...and it's been less than six months into MAGA's term, and a full third of the country is cheering for stuff like this.

It's only going to get worse from here."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "a full third of the country is cheering for stuff like this" - denial abounds. 1) not all nonvoters are not MAGA, and people under the legal age or otherwise not able to vote an be MAGA too, indoctrinated into Donald Trump / Rupert Murdoch media cult and Russia information warfare since March 2013. 2) One third is cheering: **liberals are dumb idiots and deserve to be punished for abortions and not following Trump orders**, 2) The rest are cheering: MAGA is dumb idiots. 3) Nobody is outside the total mockery of MAGA vs. people reacting with hate against MAGA. It is all media engagement, Bluesky vs. Twitter, Reddit vs. Facebook, subreddit vs. subreddit. THE POINT: It isn't just ONE THIRD.

People (not just one-third, but everyone) are consuming media about the sitaution and not doing DRASTIC things like stopping all entertainment (video games, sports) on social media to assert FACTUAL educaiton and COMPREHENSION / UNDERSTANDING.

"The GOP is, in no uncertain terms, enabling Trump and his history of sexual assault. Yet all of the headlines are about Trump. Enablers keep “victims victimised and reinforce the power and control of the abuser.” (Dr. Rachel Taylor, Abuse and the Enablers, 2023)

Mike Johnson, who shut down the House to avoid a vote to release the files, is the parent who says, “don’t take about it.” Pam Bondi and Karoline Leavitt are the siblings who choose to further victimize rather than upset their own world. Vance and hundreds of other Republicans are the friends and neighbors who don’t look too closely because they don’t want to know…but they know.

The Republican Party is shielded when we only focus on Trump. The entire party must be held accountable."
