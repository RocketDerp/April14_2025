I could be a true believer in John 1:1 if programmers focused on one tool to rule them all.

**Intelligent Multi-Pass Binary to Source Code Decompiler**    
The Fifth Element Multi-Pass /\   

The Tower of Babel translator.

1. Start with the 6502 CPU instruction set. 8-bit Commodore 64. 8-bit Apple //+ both.

2. All apps on those platforms decompiler that can produce macro assembler source code that can be compiled (assembled) into the exact original binary. Pass one.

3. OPTIONAL pass two: convert the macro assembler to ANSI C code C23 (ISO/IEC 9899:2024) - that can produce the exact same binary as created in step 2.

4. OPTIONAL pass three: commentary source code. A module for the Apple //+ and Commodore 64. CHOICE of *commentary writers / commentary editors* modules for different human written languages. Different choices of "schools of thought" on verbose link-filled (Wiki links) citations vs. more old-school terse code commenting. A super beautify of the C and macro assembler code.

5. OPTIONAL pass four: source-code optimization modules.  Different choices of "schools of thought". Best practices schools / styles. Should C code do loops a certain way? Strings a certain way? Known poor-performing code replaced with the "best of StackExchange debate" techniques. A source-code rewrite but still compatible behavior "fix old 1970's and 1980's source code techniques" with learned automated rewriting.

Then once you have these two hardware device (C64 Apple 2+) mastered at the 99% level... add Ada as the next language beyond C.  Then add 80286 8086 16-bit CPU of the IBM PC and IBM PC AT with CGA and Hercules graphics card. So the August 14, 1984 technology level.

That would get me to be a true believer in the origins of John 1:1 - the authorship of outer-space Exodus 3:5
