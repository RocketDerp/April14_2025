> “Trump’s not a leader — he’s a criminal,” says Harrison Ford, calling him the most corrupt figure in U.S. history

Ford doesn't get it. Harrison Ford's statement is [contradictory politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html).

It is not a **single person** that is the crisis. There are tons of even worse criminals. Donald J. Trump's power is leading others into Hell (metaphor of a psychological state of mob mentality, there is no Hell underground. Mindsets). A [*Pied Piper* ente*rat*ainer character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin), who turns audiences into [rats who fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7olfvXs2R4) in line.

Trump inspires people to total mockery. People are so amused at Donald Trump that wealth and power are all yielded upward into the hands of billionaires, including billionaire Putin and Musk (Twitter owner). People are so engaged in "milking the LOL cow of Trump" for amusement and entertainment chuckles and memes - that they wreck the entire nation.

Donald Trump is [an attractive nuisance leadership signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine) In the same way Fox News HDTV is an attractive nuisance to society. People can not resist the absurdity of a 79 year old man who is so experienced with casino slot machine social systems that he stages Twitter and Truth Social like a slot machine for meme audiences. 

People are so entranced and mesmerized by the total mockery that people have [lost all sense of time. Recency bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_UAIUsDYSc) abounds. The same way people in **casinos have no clocks** and missing (lost) sense of time, that they are living in a slot machine of noise and entertainment signals. Casi[no gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTR8Yj5hg4) media environments abound.

President Tony Clifton is the most successful fiction character ever played by any actor. It is impossible to put into language (any language) how people abandon goodness and flock to Trump images / Trump messages / Trump antics. He is bigger than Jesus Christ and The Beatles combined as a source of fiction entertainment content for media addicts. The best SNL Kaufman student, by far, and he inspires others around him to adopt the Tony Clifton techniques. Surkov students all (["oligarchy in the morning and a democracy in the afternoon, a monarchy for dinner and a totalitarian state by bedtime."](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/)).

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, page 85. year 2019

* “We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way **slot machines** do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 12 "Revelations", page 235, year 2019

* A core aspect of Tony Clifton performances is extreme bragging about talent and success. For example, a 2000 retrospective in The Guardian describes an announcer introducing Clifton as "a man who has sold more records than Elvis and the Beatles combined". https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/25/comment
