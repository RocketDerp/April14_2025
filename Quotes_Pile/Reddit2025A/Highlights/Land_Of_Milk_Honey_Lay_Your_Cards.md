Please refrain from banality, "This is a Wendy's, sir" Reddit hive mind commenting on this post. Mocking tinfoil, mocking "deep,/r/ I am age 14 and this is super smart egoism" is unwelcome Reddit hivemind conditioning media environment of this posting. Thank you.

### Episode One: minute 22

At minute 22 in Episode One, in a Public House setting, Helen dropped James Joyce's book "Finnegan Wake" on the bar conversation. Helen then stepped outside to light a cigarette (emphasized by Carol taking up smoking dramatically). Helen touched a touchy subject on a lit touch device, then fell backwards and cracked her head (note the eyes) like Tim Finnegan's ladder fall death.

She fell

### Episode Three: minute 31

In Episode Three, at minute 31 and a half, shortly before the explosion at Carol's house... the "water of life" is invoked by the hive mind. In greater media ecology context, booze is what reveals [Tim Finnegan to be undead]. Language translations, thunderword patterns, are invoked by the hive mind. Celtic [uisce beatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uisce_beatha) circling around ("riverrun" iteration of translations, *metaphors*).

### Episode Six: One Sentence To Rule All 

One Sentence To Rule Them All, All (Page 581 Finengans Wake MonoMyth) HiveMinds.

 Introduction and lead-up aside... One Wikipedia sentence is the payload of my Reddit posting you are currently reading. *Please Ponder* One Sentence to Rule Them All, step away from from this One Sentence 13 meters, look at One Sentence again, go lit a cigarette like Carol outside a public house after boozing, ponder the One Sentence again how it relates to *John Cena* Vegas wrestling memes and mockery on meme mixing mills.

One Sentence, research how long this sentence has been on Wikipedia / the edit history of the page, the date it was incepted: "Finnegan's wife Annie puts out his corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake, but he vanishes before they can eat him."

Repeating: ***"Finnegan's wife Annie puts out his corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake, but he vanishes before they can eat him."*** - Google the sentence, locate it's distant spacetime signal origin.  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finnegans_Wake&action=history

P.S. I am in a hurry composing this Reddit hive mind publish posting. I may edit / tweak it. Rushed writing. Thank you, happy holidays. "Woke Carol", "Wake Finnegans", year 1924 "Woke".
