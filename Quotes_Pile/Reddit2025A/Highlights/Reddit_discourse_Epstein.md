"Trump ran on it. Qanon pushed all these theories. Then Trump promised to release them. The DNC didn’t promise anything. The issue is that Trump created conspiracies that he would expose and put an end to the swamp. He lied. He created lies and promises he never planned to fulfill. 

Biden focused on Covid and economic recovery. No mention of Epstein and sex trafficking. Trump and his campaign team pushed this to the forefront of our minds to distract from the fact that Americans still can’t afford housing and college. 

Basically, don’t distract me with cake when there is no cake. Trump fell for his own trap."

"What a fucking load of word vomit. People like you act so shocked when MAGA morons show unwavering support for their politicians despite being obvious grifters and then you go and do the same shit. The thought of 1 Democrat raping a child is laughable to you, the same way MAGA laughs away Trump's accusations. The fact that you dismiss Biden because he didn't run on Epstein and sex trafficking isn't the gotcha you think it is.

Dems could have passed this vote if they actually wanted to. Both parties are definitely not the same, but they both protect the same class of people. If you can't hold your own party politicians accountable, you are no better than MAGA voters."



* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : "Both parties are definitely not the same, but they both protect the same class of people." - We The People protect the same class of people - shit-talking hate-preaching content providers. Fiction content providers. "the same way MAGA laughs away Trump's accusations" is discussion hundreds of millions of people Laughing away at Malala's efforts to give girls voices since publication of her October 8, 2013 book that social media users do not rally behind and name-drop and mention her. Exactly what is not good enough about Malala's January 2009 onward blogging? Exactly why are social media users thinking liars as politicians are going to fix these problems, was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr an elected politician... no, he was not. Why can't people learn that girls have their own voice, her name is Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan, and she went on the Internet and spoke up about the liars and deceivers who were abusing girls starting in January 2009 and in year 2012 she got a  bullet in her head on her school bus. Why can't YOU on SOCIAL MEDIA, name-drop and assert Malala as a leader to follow instead of thinking that this problem with girls being abused is going to be solved by Donald Trump and QAnon? QAnon is mentioned in this Reddit discussion... "Both parties are definitely not the same, but they both protect the same class of people." - Same as in Swat Valley Pakistan if you listen to Malala. Russia / Putin is also crushing girls, Pussy Riot needs repeating and asserting on social media. Yet, social media users want to spend their free time / spare time in denial of the kind of garbage QAnon Pizzagate is all about - **fiction addiction** and Malala is asserting **nonfiction**. [Malala came to the USA, to Atlanta, and gave a lecture - that nobody in USA seems to have noticed - during Donald Trump's term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGlFU3YW_k). About GIRLS speaking up about abusive elder men who take over ruling society. ===:::

At least people on Reddit are reviewing the December 2021 Donald Trump Jr / Trump Family riled up the QAnon / Pizzagate / fiction addictions chasing. Alas, you don't see self-awareness that Trump family itself created media spectacle. People are eating the Surkovian onions declaring Trump stupid, not recognizing Surkov Kremlin techniques of governing that has kept Putin in power for 25 years.
