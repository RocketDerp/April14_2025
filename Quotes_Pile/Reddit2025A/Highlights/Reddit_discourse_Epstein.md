"Trump ran on it. Qanon pushed all these theories. Then Trump promised to release them. The DNC didn’t promise anything. The issue is that Trump created conspiracies that he would expose and put an end to the swamp. He lied. He created lies and promises he never planned to fulfill. 

Biden focused on Covid and economic recovery. No mention of Epstein and sex trafficking. Trump and his campaign team pushed this to the forefront of our minds to distract from the fact that Americans still can’t afford housing and college. 

Basically, don’t distract me with cake when there is no cake. Trump fell for his own trap."

"What a fucking load of word vomit. People like you act so shocked when MAGA morons show unwavering support for their politicians despite being obvious grifters and then you go and do the same shit. The thought of 1 Democrat raping a child is laughable to you, the same way MAGA laughs away Trump's accusations. The fact that you dismiss Biden because he didn't run on Epstein and sex trafficking isn't the gotcha you think it is.

Dems could have passed this vote if they actually wanted to. Both parties are definitely not the same, but they both protect the same class of people. If you can't hold your own party politicians accountable, you are no better than MAGA voters."
