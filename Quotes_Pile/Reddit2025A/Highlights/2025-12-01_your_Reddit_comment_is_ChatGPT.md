I see a meme driven society that freaks out at nonfiction book citations. Factual information freaking out ChatGPT addicts who consume machine learning. I see a "new world order" being driven by A/B testing of social commenting audiences.

I see LLM brand consumer loyalists going, "wow, my brand of LLM" in public encounters. You drink the same name-brand beer I do!! Mr. Chat GPT fandom.

I see you wanting to give ChatGPT credit for human authoring and human information comment sharing. OpenAI loves when you are a Corporate America branding tool. Happy Holidays. Do you see what I see? Way up in the sky of *cloud computing*, do you see? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs9FPx3_Slk
