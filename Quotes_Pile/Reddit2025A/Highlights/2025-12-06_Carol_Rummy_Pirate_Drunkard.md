Reddit society really ignores the Carol's house bombing line about "The water of life", booze. Bombing her house, "being bombed" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16161351_The_vocabulary_of_drunkenness out of her boozed DUI mind ("DUI-Hire" military bombing metaphors https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DUI-Hire USA). That the hive mind is spelling out to the audience: exposition... exposing the theme that being a drunk / drunkard writer like Carol is "woke".

That being a boozer like Carol is "the water of life" to a *dead* wasteland Hive Mind.

Carol is "bombed out of her mind" drunkard. She is being "love bombed" by the hive mind. Carol booze bombing her self and blowing up her house. Nobody seems to grasp metaphors here, people downvote in hive mind... instead of seeing the love connections to booze DUI-hire writers / authors against the hive mind.
People won't even discuss these themes of drinking! Water and food, Hunger Games, in episode 6. Audience just hive mind downvotes without replies. Pirate lady shit, ho ho ho, a bottle of rum!  Carol bombs her house, "Dead Man Walking" Carol after she bombs her house with "the water of life" hive mind meeting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Man%27s_Chest

P.S. BONUS: Breaking Bad Vance writers "Bug Bomb" metaphors of Meth mind-blowing, "bombed out" on chemical dependence. https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Vamonos_Pest - did they hit Carol's house? - DOUBLE VEGAS CASINO BONUS POINTS: Episode One 22 minutes, Carol takes up inhalation fumes, smoking, with Helen as they celebrate the Joycean end of the world at the Public House boozing. From her *book dealer* partner, Carol takes a hit of chemicals metaphors. Romance chemistry lighting up The Black Parade of the hive mind takeover. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Parade

P.S.S. Is the title of the episode not a clue enough for Reddit / Apple TV+ audiences? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_Grenade_(cocktail) and Episode One minute 22 Joyce / Dublin Public House *Fall* of Tim Finnegan / Helen? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_car_bomb_(cocktail) and boozer author Carol? "[Lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning) a free creature to water, but can't make drink" / drinking metaphors of Carol's refusing to drink from the fruit Tree of Knowledge *Apple+Jack*? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applejack_(drink) that the word "spirit" doesn't apply to Helen in the hive mind, spirits https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor haunting Carol?
