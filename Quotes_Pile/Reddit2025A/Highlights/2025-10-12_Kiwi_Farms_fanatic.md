Still replying in an empty corner of the Reddit machine commenting section. Fixated on me. You are unable to see the forest for the one tree you bark at.

> Kiwi Farms would have called you a "lolcow."

Yha, I bet you use Kiwi Farms as your mental training ground. Russian playground for out-group hate training, meme terrorist mindsets.

> Kiwi Farms would have called you a "lolcow."

your MAGA-speak, like how media consumers in USA year 2025 mock and call people "libtards" and cheer on "liberal tears" of people who read NONFICTION and do not worship Fox News or Kiwi Farms or Newsmax messages / John 1:1 "gods".

Get help? how? I'm **living in the United States of America in October 2025 where Donald Trump is ruling the nation**. What help do think there is for that situation? And people who hide their real names on trash media sites like Fox News, Reddit and Kiwi Farms ... stalk you for days with hate messaging because they worship Truth Social media content and Kiwi Farms and Fox News as the John 1:1 word gods / idea gods.

You are into some weird shit I never heard of or *flocked to like you do*. More of your John 1:1 input you put into your mind / program yourself with. "Sonichu" sounds like fiction, your avoidance of nonfiction learning again. The quotes I shared on Reddit were **NONFICTION** which really gets you on the war-path. I quoted NONFICTION of "Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality" on Reddit and how it is relevant to USA October 2025 situation, and you are here to attack Peter Pomerantsev teachings.

It is Sunday the Bible and Church day, you need lessons:

Sunday... How about some teaching from an American man from Atlanta, Georgia USA.

# The 1954 Equation

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

More context from NONFICTION. An American man from Brooklyn, New York:

“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995
