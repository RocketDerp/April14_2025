> The biggest example of that for me is her drugging Zosia.

She is an American. Zosia is an Africa Immigrant, Islamic person, after September 11, 2001.

* Torture metaphors of "truth drug". Caged Zosia with Police handcuffs {sexual metaphors of cuffs, props, imprisoning Pirate Lady she created as a character) while she is weak / wheelchair / kicking when down.

* Orders a weapon to her house, then attempts a suicide bombing. Murder/suicide Islamic terrorism invocation of Africa.

* The first time Carol crashes the hive mind and kills millions of people, it is a street fight, audience vs. audience gang war, book club war - on the streets of a city. Suburban fighting metaphors. Turf wars.

* Carol drives around in a Police car, creating Police State metaphors. Active policing USA from alien outsiders metaphors. Lesbian pussy rioting metaphors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaZl12Z5P7g Police predatory hunting metaphors: Carol protecting her nest egg / frozen eggs / womb. Lyrics: "No problems in paradise!"

> Carol did that to try to save humanity.

That's what Mecca hive mind (book readers: Helen book publisher, Carol book author) say too. Literary metaphors. That suicide bombings are to save humanity. September 11, 2001 metaphors again.
