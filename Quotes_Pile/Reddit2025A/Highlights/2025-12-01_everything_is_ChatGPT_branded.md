Yes, because you are so immersed in Reddit trash commenting of December 2025 that when a published nonfiction book is quoted it blows your mind into discarding it.

You have a problem called "The ELIZA effect" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect that you can't tell an 83 year old professor from Sarah Lawrence college that was ChatGPT training material from ChatGPT output. You can't distinguish reality itself from machine media interfaces.

Your message is low-effort noise to drown out signal. That's how your comment "reads". Newfoundlander.  Have you never studied Marshall McLuhan... from The University of Toronto? Media ecology self-awareness lacking on your own part? Can't tell ChatGPT from humans and go around in public calling people machines, dehumanizing them (and directing people away from the actual topic of mythologizing a bus birth).

You must have consumed a lot of ChatGPT to say that. Were you just using it in another screen? Has ChatGPT programmed your mind into conditioned mindsets? A book published on paper in 1988 isn't ChatGPT.  You are creating your own mythology (public dream) of ChatGPT use on Reddit without self-awareness. I suggest you study the cited book from 1988. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell_and_the_Power_of_Myth

It's like a new trend for youth these days. Going around every time they see the numbers "6 and 7" and making gestures. ChatGPT since December 2022 has really gotten a cult fallowing. The cultists of ChatGPT just come up to strangers like "That's my favorite rock band!" - what are you talking about? I'm commenting about the bus ritual birth and mythology of machine society. Are you listening to ChatGPT on your headphones or something? "That's my favorite brand of LLM!" commenting?
