Bible verse John 1:1, I do.

The very topic of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake teachings!

Bible verse John 1:1, the coining of memes and words. Who is the originator. Who is forbidden from creating new meanings to "Eat the Onion", "Ate the Onions", "Ate the Surkovian Onions" of Russian Surkov students.

See, I can create new meanings to words and language, I don't need John 1:1 permission from "God", as I have never seen God. Bible verse "1 John 4:20".

I have seen language, and I have seen idioms, and I have seen words, I have seen John 1:1 words. But I have never "seen God" as "1 John 4:20" Bible verse explains. I have never "seen Jesus", as it is all metaphors.

# John 1:1 - Eye in the Sky

Year 1776, United States of America Founding Fathers, that Pyramid with the Eye, Egypt on the Nile river in north Africa? www.GreatSealUSA.com

John 1:1, I am the originator of Lyrics. I create words in any order and sequence I wish. John 1:1 is the Eye in the Sky on the Great Seal of the Founding Fathers. Finnegans Wake is the proof of the equations of John 1:1.
