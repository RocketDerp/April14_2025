Why don't you ask yourself,  fellow Americans:

1. Why was this August 24, 2018 story not pinned on Twitter when January 30, 2020 came around? COVID-2019?

2. Is Johns Hopkins University respected in USA society as a fact-checking research organization?

3. Is George Washington University?

4. Why did Fox News not pin this story https://www.foxnews.com/tech/russian-trolls-blamed-for-spreading-anti-vaccination-propaganda on their home page January 30, 2020? When COVID-2019 was a big topic. And keep it pinned on their page?

5. Why doesn't Stephen Colbert repeat this on his YouTube channel since January 30, 2020? *Star Wars Day* 2019 YouTube, Colbert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju7Yt0LMiVk

6. Why didn't Reddit pin that posting to the top of every page since January 30, 2020? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju7Yt0LMiVk - less than 1 year earlier, nobody on Reddit watches Colbert? COVID-2019, ANYONE? Is Stephen Colbert's microphone working?

7. Why didn't Facebook post it to the top of every page?

8. Why didn't YouTube posit it to the top of every page?

9. Who Was President January 30, 2020 when COVID-2019 became top topic - and what was that President's relationship with Russia?

10. Look closely at the August 24,2018  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 BBC story a second time: "It examined thousands of tweets sent **between 2014 and 2017**. Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a "wedge issue", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University." ... **year 2014** evidence.

We are living in a nation in massive psychological denial. NATO is in denial of ongoing measles.
