I'm discussing the forest for trees problem of USA society since year 2013 (and cited year 2012 Trump agreement with Kremlin) regarding Marshall McLuhan defined "mass man". Russian information warfare exploiting the Reddit hive mind.

> Maybe people don't engage with you on a serious level about Russian influence

Show me where end-users engage this topic on Reddit in year 2025. Show me how many here call out the "Internet Research Agency" by name or link the Washington Monthly post I cited: https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/ - show me Reddit postings calling out COVID-19 and measles mind exploitation going back to year 2014 by Russia, please. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

I am not asking a rhetorical question, please show your evidence of people engaging these topics ANYWHERE on Reddit. As I am pointing out the avoidance of Reddit (exploited hive mind) discussing Russian information warfare psychology tactics. Americans in year 2025 use Reddit to mock Americans, exactly as conditioned by Russia. Mocking MAGA /r/LeopardsAteMyFace day after day, hour after hour.

> Russia et all is just priming the ground for China in the upcoming few decades.

Ok, you said it. And you seem to be encouraging it, cheering it on, and facilitating it. I am calling out that it is 100% of the population, not "one third" like so many here chant and parrot since year 2016... are "owned" by Cambridge Analytica manipulation. The Reddit Hive Mind is detached from reality itself. Russia won the "War Against Reality" and people can't even discuss it seriously with nonfiction.

You really have context bewilderment. As you jumped into a thread about White House media of late November 2025.

&nbsp;

>  you write like a loony.

You are in denial. You can not tolerate diverse use of English language and you are a language bigot. You hate the idea of diverse society having people who are immigrants and don't write English as their primary language - as conditioned by Surkovian information warfare since year 2013. Why so many in year 2025 block on media, which is deporting people outside conditioned mindsets. Language fragile, anti-diverse, "inside the box" thinking is what you crave. Surkov won!

> Russia et all is just priming the ground for China in the upcoming few decades.

You are so fixated on China (and on-site Reddit comment mental context) that you can't even see September 11, 2001 - the [Bible MAGA forces in USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church), Levant monomyth usage by Russia https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russian-orthodox-church-declares-holy-war-against-ukraine-and-west/ , and Saudi Arabia Mecca vs. Western World (especially "The Great Satan" of Founding Fathers reason thinking). Taliban defeated USA. Israel and Palestine are in the news every hour of every day since October 7, Putin's birthday, 2023.

&nbsp;

P.S. My link-full citation-full comment message took far more thinking and labor than your simplistic "China bad" messaging. You cite nothing, no authors, no books, nothing. Exactly as conditioned: low-effort disposable message prizing. Avoidance of off-Reddit nonfiction serious citations.
