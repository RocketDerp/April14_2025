> Quite the leap jumping

Christmas day season Apple Computers icon mythology. Vince Gilligan said he is making a mythology science fiction story like The Bible. "Pluck an Apple" - Carol.  Vince Gilligan interview: https://youtu.be/kFrffEktluo?t=3315

A lot of people really struggle reading between the lines (drawing outside the lines to Vince Gilligan's February 15, 2025 guild points) with shows not written for second-screen audiences of December 2025. https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/17/not-second-screen-enough-is-netflix-deliberately-dumbing-down-tv-so-people-can-watch-while-scrolling

> Few corrections: the audience is only aware of the eggs because C is not oblivious to them. She mentioned them in Ep 3.

You got a timestamp on when she mentioned them past the zero hour? Scene or to who?

> Vince is not the greatest

Autistic Anthony Hopkins link I gave you... skipped past it? And you are some kind of hive mind that dictates to everyone on which monomyth story is the greatest of our time?

>  the newest, inexperienced streaming company picked him up.

Apple Computers has far more experience with social media audiences back to BBS on the Apple 8-bit systems https://www.applefritter.com/content/80-apple-ii-bbs

And games and app experience that Netflix can't comprehend about hive mind audience cultures.

People here really have trouble realizing they are being addressed by the show content.

there's no simple answer for how *we* might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other

But I don't know how to make that happen. So, I'll stick to my wheelhouse as
a writer speaking to a room full of writers. I have a proposal.

> Apple might win the sci-fi base over only at the cost of its rep, the gay community and women all over is all. 

> Apple didn't listen to the critics screaming about Vince's risk taking being dangerous. 

Sure, it is incredibly dangerous to take on social media hive minds.

Taking on the Breaking Bad / Saul fandom is very dangerous. Taking on the Christmas Levant science fiction fandom of outer-space pregnancy from Kepler angel messengers.

Draining the Palestine /  Holy Lands / Social media fandom swamps is incredibly dangerous. He has to encode everything between the lines. Using the Latin "Pluribus" encryption keys on the dollar bill symbols.

I think Carol playing a  *drunken* Jihadi to an immigrant in her house with a bomb was pretty clear to anyone who can read deeply between the lines. In New Mexico of all places, saying it was an "accident'. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_shooting_incident  Then she drugs the immigrant at the hospital to capture her (handcuffs), driving around in a police state car.

> Apple didn't listen to the critics screaming about Vince's risk taking being dangerous. 

I mean, *the man* has gone after Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert, how long can Vince's encoded Latin metaphors fly under the radar?

Apple tree of knowledge Levant "Pluck an Apple" - Carol is really flying past so many this Christmas.
