There are no supernatural books. The Bible, Quran, Torah - these books are not magic, they are not supernatural.

I don't get why social media won't rise up and confront the literacy problems directly, *the direct approach*. Make Bible literacy a front-page topic every damn day until every person in the USA grasps key understandings.  Hamlet's Ghost is science fiction, Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghosts" are science fiction, Bible angels are science fiction!

These are what we need to be preaching.

1. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" - how *I Love Jesus* is wrong, incorrect! 

2. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" -  you have never seen Jesus, you have never *seen* God, you have only read a poetry book! You are in love with a character in a book, which is not real love! That's the whole point of this Bible verse!

3. Bible verse "1 John 3:17' - apply it to Elon Musk, Donald Trump, etc. This verse should be memorized by every damn person in USA in year 2025 between the age of 12 and age 120. South Park should devote an entire episode to teaching this one single Bible verse and make it bigger than "6 7" meme.

And as for sinners, take Bible verse Romans 11:32 and circle it around in James Joyce's books and shove it up your ass. God is the very source of sin. Romans 11:32 verse.
