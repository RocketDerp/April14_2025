Unpacking the title and linked video and references

1. Saturday Night Live, SNL, is New York City

2. Andy Kaufman was on SNL, New York City, Taxi TV show, etc

3. Donald Trump from New York City is a television addict and watches and comments on SNL NYC. He knows the performers. Trurmp owned casinos, he knows the comedy entertainers (their comedy techniques and Trump has a keen eye on how audiences have minds blown out by Kaufman methods).

4. Tony Clifton **carrot juice** act on stage and on television news. *Bizarre, surreal, absurd entertainment* / reality TV "fake news" coverage on REAL news. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTR8Yj5hg4&t=135s

5. This is an adaptation of Reality governing of year 2011 Surkov / Kremlin methods. Think of shows like The Office USA year 2005 that were imported from The Office UK year 2001. In this case, the Kremlin has manipulated minds in USA to adopt / adapt their antics governing techniques out of compulsive mindsets. USA fanatics fixated on Putin, minds blown into compulsive fandom cosplay.

6. July 2020 ðŸ«˜ðŸ«˜ Goya Beans ðŸ«˜ðŸ«˜, Iconically displayed on the alter of the White House Oval Office venue. Symbolism like making carrot juice Tony Clifton act on the stage, in this case, the White House press corps stage. https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-president-is-shilling-beans

7. Goya Foods is New York City. Just like Andy Kaufman SNL, just like Donald Trump. All run in the same memespheres. [psychospheres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z113cALjgl0). 

8. Timeline. The carrot juice act / Goya bean Oval Office performance was July 2020. Which is before January 6, 2021.

9. During CPAC 2021 (after January 6), Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue claimed the 2020 election was illegitimate, and that Donald Trump was "the real, the legitimate, and the still actual president". https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/28/politics/fact-check-goya-unanue-election-cpac/index.html

10. Absurd, surreal, audience mind-blowing. The audience being the domestic population and the world stage of all media systems that covers the White House press / Goya images in the Oval Office. One example, [Australia down-under news covered this world news event of ~~carrot juice /~~ Goya beans](https://www.9news.com.au/world/ivanka-trump-goya-beans-controversy-us-politics-donald-trump-business-support-ethics/25a03ce5-38cd-4614-82d9-46f6e753a5ed)

&nbsp;

The greatest entertainer in all human history. Surkov student screenplays blended with Tony Clifton screenplays. Tony Clifton acts also often have Clifton getting off the stage and interacting / improv with the audience members. Which Trump does regularly, improv added to the scripted / written Reality TV shows. Also worth a brain tickle that Saturday Night Live does "fake news" as ["Weekend Update" NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMcOI24WsYA), on how to blow minds with absurd surreal news antics. All part of the NYC media techniques of mind-blowing audiences.

This government is like a [memory of a White House, and the memory is fading](https://youtu.be/z113cALjgl0?t=20).
