> Carol's relationship with alcohol is clearly being highlighted

Two women go into a bar, a married couple ([according to Variety](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/pluribus-explained-vince-gilligan-rhea-seehorn-1236571666/): "Carol is at a bar when the rest of the population, including her wife Helen, begins to twitch unconsciously.") who returned from a business trip. Media tour, book tour.

One spouse says to the other: you really need a drink, we can take a cab home. They are in a "Public House" and singsong abounds. And one of the two women brings up James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.

Now most Americans are not very familiar with Finnegans Wake, but it is a mind-blowing book. And being in a bar drinking booze talking about Finnegans Wake is the very setting of Finnegans Wake.

Then one of the spouses drops dead (blackout from the hive mind upgrade virus) while consuming social media... but cause of death seems to be the skull fracture from "falling down" on a hard surface. The media *screen* is cracked, the brain skull is cracked. The monomyth is cracked! *That too* is Finnegans Wake. The surviving spouse has a big ordeal with the body of the dead partner. She is the only one to not have experienced a blackout from the virus.... and when she arrives home she boozes up on a bottle of whiskey and blacks out at a desk.

Then some odd revelations come about that the dead spouse merged her soul with the hive mind shortly before she died. And if... some kind of afterlife Matrix...

The couple's relationship with literary publishing and writing is clearly being highlighted.  Including spending nearly 5 years on an unpublished "Work In Progress" (the original title of Finnegans Wake).
