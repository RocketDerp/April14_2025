Every year the supremacist come out this season. Story supremacists who claim The Bible is the one true perfect book and no other book in the public library is perfect. Who killed many trilogy fandom of the Torah in Germany 1930's and 1940's. They wave around their holiday symbols and claim that only one book is better than the whole public library. Story supremacists, book supremacists, street gangs of violence all.

>  in case there are any people who are daft, there is no call to violence at all, quite the opposite. The picture shown is of a professional fight. Violence is not the answer.

Gullibility to science fiction trilogies is the main concern here. Falling for the gullible holiday street gangs and their supremacy of one *and only one* true outer space pregnancy story.
