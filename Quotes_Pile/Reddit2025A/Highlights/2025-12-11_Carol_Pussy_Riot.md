Chekhov's gun.  Just like American Carol boozing up with a loaded gun on the table in ABQ meeting before the house explosion.  ("Rust" filmed in New Mexico where an actor thought a loaded gun was a toy prop, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, wounding director Joel Souza)

And "The Big One" that the house explosion lead to... her request for a New Mexico Manhattan Project "Atom Bomb" Chekhov's  gun that is loaded. I'm surprised that people here don't mention Stephen King's famous virus outbreak (also from a military lab) book / TV series: The Stand, and the Chekhov's gun pointed at the Elvis suite in the city of Las Vegas. https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/the-stand-randall-flagg-vegas-destruction-1234992385/  Or even the overlapping TV series of Loaded Gun Fallout Vegas that's streaming...

The most obvious is the title of a show pointing to the title of a book. Book author, book publisher, book tour opening., changing the order of books at the airport book store.

"Pluribus" November 2025 TV show title    
"Pluribus" April 2021 book title

Please sing along: ... Carol is having a *pussy riot* driving around in a police state of mind, civil defense against the hive mind. ...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaZl12Z5P7g - Take my *stem cells*, now you own me... *No problema* in Paradise....
