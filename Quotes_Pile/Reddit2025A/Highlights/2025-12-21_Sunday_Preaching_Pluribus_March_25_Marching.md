There has been a lot of [out-of-band information](https://youtu.be/kFrffEktluo?t=3315) from Vince Gilligan and cast / crew.

> Can you please elaborate on this? 

Vince has used his extreme popularity and success to stand at the WGA on February 15, 2025 and preach about online fandoms: "there's no simple answer for how we might change that. Though, if there were, I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other" https://youtu.be/TkteSxVIM1A?t=648

Despite people having machines that can easily translate Arabic to English quickly, an accomplishment of humanity in coming together, people are nasty and hate-filled towards outsiders and people they perceive to be diverse or unique.

> I'm not familiar with the religious part

My emphasis is that orthodox communications and competition between religions is toxic. It is like lording over someone because they speak Japanese language and consider it superior to French writing and speaking. This is emphasized in the story very early when Carol commands the hive mind to assemble the free people and excludes those who don't speak English. And how in Episode Seven the man who is immigrating to the USA feels compelled and obligated to read and learn English as he walks through jungles and risks his life to come to the USA to speak with Carol.

The show being released on Christmas Day Eve is very symbolic for a woman whose oocyte is being courted like the second coming (such as the burned down story-writing location now rebuilt as a living nativity scene / holy authoring crèche) of Jesus *H*imself. A lesbian woman who for *all we know* is a total virgin, has never touched a spermatozoon cell in her lifetime.

Name how many science fiction stories there are about a woman having her Easter egg basket filled by outer-space fertilization? 

The date of the final episode [can not be a coincidence or "matter of chance"](https://youtu.be/RouxCGls5m8?t=15). 

The military genetic lab of working with the 78 second RNA biological message from outer space. What's so special about this *one mother* and December 24, 2025 / December 25, 2025 dawning? In science fiction, t's the best selling [outer-space alien invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Invasion)  story.

I think Vince Gilligan is trying to reverse the audience circumstances of fandoms. ["I bet it would have something to do with climbing up out of the cesspool that is social media and actually listening to each other"] (https://youtu.be/TkteSxVIM1A?t=648)

March 25 is being inverted. [Ο Ευαγγελισμός της Θεοτόκου](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Annunciation). There are many here *among us* (Plurib.us) who feel life is but a *joke*. While all the [women came and went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY), barefoot servants, too. Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl.

I think Vince Gilligan is sending a message from Earth to Kepler and beyond. [March 25 is being re*conceived*](https://thesethingsinside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/) by addressing the audience interpretations and prizing of cesspools.
