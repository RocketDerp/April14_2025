Reddit comments from July 2025 

these comments make sense if you have spent since year 2014 ignoring:

1. Peter Pomerantsev [2014: "Menace of Unreality", "Information Warfare"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)
2. Adam Curtis [2014: "Contradictory Vaudeville"](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)
3. Anything written about techniques of media enagement from goverment to people around Vladislav Surkov
4. No mentioning of Cambridge Analytica - military psycological manipulation form - and that there could possibly be permananent aftermath and side-effects. Further, [that Russia worked with Cambridge Analytica since November 2012](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/).

#### Ate The Surkovian Onion

In reference to The Onion magazine / website founded August 29, 1988.

#### Surkovian Onion Breath

Enjoyed and thrilled by the bamboozle and speaking of how great and exciting it is to be able to mock the Kremlin and White House and Rupert Murdoch for being dumb, idiots, stupid when egomania kicks in (the egomania being the onion breath). An everyday media consumer person on social media declaring how incredibly stupid idiots demented others are without citing Peter Pomerantsev (or how [entertaining all this is, Neil Postman 1985](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley) - written at the time of entertainer Ronald Reagan being POTUS).

"He says his political opponents (Obama, Hillary, etc.) created them. Which means:

HE’S IN THEM.

This is as obvious as it gets and only someone with dementia would give a tell as big as this."

"It’s CRAZY how many people are so easily baffled by narcissistic sociopathic DARVO tactics. His behavior is 101."

"This whole journey has me constantly being amazed at how dumb people are. Like fine, get duped by a conman—shame on him—but THIS conman? And for this long?? Really???"
