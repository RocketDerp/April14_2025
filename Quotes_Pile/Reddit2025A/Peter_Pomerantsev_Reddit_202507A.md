Reddit comments from July 2025 

these comments make sense if you have spent since year 2014 ignoring:

1. Peter Pomerantsev [2014: "Menace of Unreality", "Information Warfare"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)
2. Adam Curtis [2014: "Contradictory Vaudeville"](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)
3. Anything written about techniques of media enagement from goverment to people around Vladislav Surkov
4. Cambridge Analytica - [military psycological doctorates, organized manipulation firm](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy) - and that there could possibly be permananent aftermath and side-effects in the general population. Further, [that Russia worked with Cambridge Analytica since November 2012](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/).
5. Pizzagate, QAnon topics - without reference to ["War Against Reality" information warfare topics from **year 2014** Peter Pomerantsev](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). - Also avoiding any of the public notices of **factual evidence* that [QAnon was promoted by Russia since year 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/qanon-russia-conspiracy-theory-trump-2020-election-b1536946.html) - and that [QAnon symbols were promenent at January 6, 2021 insurection](https://time.com/5928627/symbols-capitol/).

&nbsp;

Supposed [super-patriots of the United States of America](https://billmoyers.com/story/trump-the-american-fascist/) don't ever seem to want to stay focused on dicussions related to dates and details of evidence of Putin [year 2014 onward measles and anti-vacination](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192) and year 2017 QAnon evidence of ties to Russian military social media invasion to manipulate executive function mental of everyday Americans.

#### Ate The Surkovian Onion

In reference to The Onion magazine / website founded August 29, 1988.

#### Surkovian Onion Breath

Enjoyed and thrilled by the bamboozle and speaking of how great and exciting it is to be able to mock the Kremlin and White House and Rupert Murdoch for being dumb, idiots, stupid when egomania kicks in (the egomania being the onion breath). An everyday media consumer person on social media declaring how incredibly stupid idiots demented others are without citing Peter Pomerantsev (or how [entertaining all this is, Neil Postman 1985](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley) - written at the time of entertainer Ronald Reagan being POTUS).

Thinking that **ONLY MAGA**, only the Republicans, ONLY the White House has been manipulated by the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica and social media organizations profiting off concealing Peter Pomerantsev's published writing since year 2014. This has evolved, as intended by Russia, into EVERYONE. Not just Republicans / Donald Trump / MAGA. The insulting and mocking is is a circular firing squad, a Mexican standoff. It is perpetual total mockery.

Why haven't these social media companies (Reddit and Bluesky) pinned educational posts to people and informed their users to see the *forest for the trees* of how:

1. "But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A **ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable** because it is undefinable." - [Adam Cutis, year 2014](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)

2. "The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it **climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd.**" - [Peter Pomerantsev, 2014](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8035579.Peter_Pomerantsev)

&nbsp;

Streisand effect isn't being *avoided*, it is being actively *exploited*. People keep thinking they are *winning* when all this is scriped Surkovian screenplay for social media consumers. Thinking it is funny, entertaining, amusing, hillarious, ironic - without breaking outside the out-gorup oreintation and citing Neil Postman or Adam Curtis or Peter Pomerantsev. Not connecting it to how Russia has convcinced domestic Russian people to keep Putin in power for decades and die for a war against Ukraine since February 2014 using these manipulation techniques (again,social media users not seeing the NATO forest since November 2012 for the Donald Trump and MAGA July 2025 trees).

"He says his political opponents (Obama, Hillary, etc.) created them. Which means:

HE’S IN THEM.

This is as obvious as it gets and only someone with dementia would give a tell as big as this."

"It's hilarious how differently Bidens have treated Hunter's laptop thing.   
"Yeah, he's an addict, here's some pictures of his massive dong and some hookers".    
Meanwhile Trump is determined to have the republican party implode due to the Streisand effect."

"Epstein predates Obama by decades and the accusations of the victims had nothing to do with him or Biden. Blaming your predecessors for what you did is a cheap shot and cheap shots are Trump’s main way to avoid responsibility for things that have nothing to do with them. Look at the timeframes and the facts and that finger pointing often doesn’t match either of them.

At some points in the past, Trump could have distanced himself from this mess, but pointing fingers and telling people not to look and just forget about it had created a vortex that he obviously is involved in and will only get stronger and not just fade away. Guilty people and liars give too much detail to try and throw investigators off the track, but that’s what usually tips them off that things don’t match up and for seasoned investigators gives them clues more about what’s not being said than what is. And, because Trump can’t keep his mouth shut or thinks that obvious lies will get him off the hook is the one giving that vortex more strength that will eventually pull him and others down onto it. That’s why he’s panicking. He is strongly implying that he has a lot to hide and can’t retract what’s already known or he’s already said about it. It only raises more questions instead of answers that have any consistency. This could take him down and it won’t be anybody’s fault but his own.

In retrospect, if you have secrets that could destroy you and others very close to you, then getting in the spotlight like running for office instead of staying under the radar isn’t a great idea. Did he honestly think that he could keep everything he’s ever done hidden forever? His ego got him into this and it won’t help him out of it. At some point everything comes out if you’re always wanting to be in the limelight."

"It's funny in a way. You got people killing themselves working 60 to 70 hours a week to get by, because of the economic model they "support", who come home too exhausted from living their "beliefs".

So they turn on the TV and the rich people tell them what their other beliefs are.

Its pretty ironic, they are so exhausted from the dog shit society they made and defend that it also makes them too tired to think.

Just put on the TV and keep believing the dog shit that downgraded your life into needing that 60 to 70 hours to survive. 

It's self propelling slavery and honestly sad."

"Insanity and the fact that MAGA Republicans created pizzagate back in 2016 during Trump’s first election cycle as a precursor against the impending backlash from his involvement with the underaged and trafficked. It’s all preemptive and accusations in a mirror."

"I find it amazing how so many people keep finding things they think will for sure ruin Trump. The same people, or type of person if too young to remember, who posted constantly about how the Mueller's report was for sure to bring an end to Trump. Or a 100 other things.

All y’all need to get some reality. Nobody is backing out of maga. They might hem and haw a bit, but almost none of them are going to vote democrat no matter what. So they will fall in line soon enough when there is no other option but Trump or a crazy lib."

"Funny that this is the thing that is changing their minds. Destroying our economy, waging war against immigrants and minorities, weaponizing the entire justice system and law enforcement agencies, selling out working Americans to fund tax breaks for the rich, abandoning our allies overseas and emboldening our enemies, already being a convicted rapist……but not releasing the list from the guy he had been documented to be close with for over two decades. Fucking clowns."

"It'd be great if these MAGAs that are suddenly waking up would go through the last 10 years and reevaluate all the claims they believed at face value that  Trump made about Hilary, Obama, Biden, Jan 6, Floyd, caravans, Kamala, etc"
