# Reddit comments

Reddit comments from July 2025 

these comments make sense if you have spent since year 2014 ignoring:

1. Peter Pomerantsev [2014: "Menace of Unreality", "Information Warfare"](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)
2. Adam Curtis [2014: "Contradictory Vaudeville"](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)
3. Anything written about techniques of media enagement from goverment to people around Vladislav Surkov
4. Cambridge Analytica - [military psycological doctorates, organized manipulation firm](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy) - and that there could possibly be permananent aftermath and side-effects in the general population. Further, [that Russia worked with Cambridge Analytica since November 2012](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/).
5. Pizzagate, QAnon topics - without reference to ["War Against Reality" information warfare topics from **year 2014** Peter Pomerantsev](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/). - Also avoiding any of the public notices of **factual evidence* that [QAnon was promoted by Russia since year 2017](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/qanon-russia-conspiracy-theory-trump-2020-election-b1536946.html) - and that [QAnon symbols were promenent at January 6, 2021 insurection](https://time.com/5928627/symbols-capitol/).
6. Thinking it is only *paid advertisement with money to follow* when the Internet Research Agency clearly is described as using [*free* upvoting / likes / comments back since year 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/).... which is *validated* by discovery of free commenting messages (not paid advertisement) by [scrunity from George Washington Uniersity and Johns Hopkins University going back to year 2014](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/23/russian-trolls-spread-vaccine-misinformation-on-twitter).
7. Constant *distraction theory*, *shiny object* theory - without being able to cite Neil Postman / Andrew Postman, Peter P that this is entertainment. This isn't distraction, this is engagement (offering channels people can flip back and forth between - media addiction to fiction, avoiding non-fiction reality), Donald Trump is a social media / mainstream media content creator of fiction to wreck reality. This is the War Against Reality center stange, the "distraction" is authentic science reality, nonfiction. Just like Mecca and Quran, it is a religion, people aren't *distracted* by the religion, it is their choice of fiction (religion) over reality. This is a much deeper and more complex problem of humanity going back thousands of years. This is the "old world order" of mythology, not the science perspective of 1776 Great Seal of the United States of American symbolism "new world order".
8. Comments about how nothing makes sense and nobody bothers to discuss Peter P's writings since year 2013, Andrew Postman 2017 / Neil Postman 1985, etc.
9. "Flooding the Zone", "Gish Gallop" references without EVER referencing Surkov / Peter P / Internet Research Agency / Cambridge Analytica / Neil Postman.
10. References to Project 2025 without ever mentioning 2019 book (pre-pandemic) titled "The Plot To Break America" that has this quote: “In one experiment, CA would show people on online panels pictures of simple bar graphs about uncontroversial things (e.g., the usage rates of mobile phones or sales of a car type) and the majority would be able to read the graph correctly. However, unbeknownst to the respondents, the data behind these graphs had actually been derived from politically controversial topics, such as income inequality, climate change, or deaths from gun violence. When the labels of the same graphs were later switched to their actual controversial topic, respondents who were made angry by identity threats were more likely to misread the relabeled graphs that they had previously understood. What CA observed was that when respondents were angry, their need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led CA to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America

&nbsp;

Supposed [super-patriots of the United States of America](https://billmoyers.com/story/trump-the-american-fascist/) don't ever seem to want to stay focused on dicussions related to dates and details of evidence of Putin [year 2014 onward measles and anti-vacination](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192) and year 2017 QAnon evidence of ties to Russian military social media invasion to manipulate executive function mental of everyday Americans.

&nbsp;

#### Ate The Surkovian Onion

In reference to The Onion magazine / website founded August 29, 1988.

#### Surkovian Onion Breath

Enjoyed and thrilled by the bamboozle and speaking of how great and exciting it is to be able to mock the Kremlin and White House and Rupert Murdoch for being dumb, idiots, stupid when egomania kicks in (the egomania being the onion breath). An everyday media consumer person on social media declaring how incredibly stupid idiots demented others are without citing Peter Pomerantsev (or how [entertaining all this is, Neil Postman 1985](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley) - written at the time of entertainer Ronald Reagan being POTUS).

Thinking that **ONLY MAGA**, only the Republicans, ONLY the White House has been manipulated by the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica and social media organizations profiting off concealing Peter Pomerantsev's published writing since year 2014. This has evolved, as intended by Russia, into EVERYONE. Not just Republicans / Donald Trump / MAGA. The insulting and mocking is a circular firing squad, a Mexican standoff (friendly fire circular Americans hate upon Americans, as Putin intended with Operation Matthew 4:19). It is perpetual total mockery.

Why haven't these social media companies (Reddit and Bluesky) pinned educational posts to people and informed their users to see the *forest for the trees* of how:

1. "But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A **ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable** because it is undefinable." - [Adam Cutis, year 2014](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)

2. "The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it **climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd.**" - [Peter Pomerantsev, 2014](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8035579.Peter_Pomerantsev)

&nbsp;

Streisand effect isn't being *avoided*, it is being actively *exploited*. People keep thinking they are *winning* when all this is scriped Surkovian screenplay for social media consumers. Thinking it is funny, entertaining, amusing, hillarious, ironic - without breaking outside the out-gorup oreintation and citing Neil Postman or Adam Curtis or Peter Pomerantsev. Not connecting it to how Russia has convcinced domestic Russian people to keep Putin in power for decades and die for a war against Ukraine since February 2014 using these manipulation techniques (again,social media users not seeing the NATO forest since November 2012 for the Donald Trump and MAGA July 2025 trees).

"Epstein predates Obama by decades and the accusations of the victims had nothing to do with him or Biden. Blaming your predecessors for what you did is a cheap shot and cheap shots are Trump’s main way to avoid responsibility for things that have nothing to do with them. Look at the timeframes and the facts and that finger pointing often doesn’t match either of them.

At some points in the past, Trump could have distanced himself from this mess, but pointing fingers and telling people not to look and just forget about it had created a vortex that he obviously is involved in and will only get stronger and not just fade away. Guilty people and liars give too much detail to try and throw investigators off the track, but that’s what usually tips them off that things don’t match up and for seasoned investigators gives them clues more about what’s not being said than what is. And, because Trump can’t keep his mouth shut or thinks that obvious lies will get him off the hook is the one giving that vortex more strength that will eventually pull him and others down onto it. That’s why he’s panicking. He is strongly implying that he has a lot to hide and can’t retract what’s already known or he’s already said about it. It only raises more questions instead of answers that have any consistency. This could take him down and it won’t be anybody’s fault but his own.

In retrospect, if you have secrets that could destroy you and others very close to you, then getting in the spotlight like running for office instead of staying under the radar isn’t a great idea. Did he honestly think that he could keep everything he’s ever done hidden forever? His ego got him into this and it won’t help him out of it. At some point everything comes out if you’re always wanting to be in the limelight."

"It's funny in a way. You got people killing themselves working 60 to 70 hours a week to get by, because of the economic model they "support", who come home too exhausted from living their "beliefs".

So they turn on the TV and the rich people tell them what their other beliefs are.

Its pretty ironic, they are so exhausted from the dog shit society they made and defend that it also makes them too tired to think.

Just put on the TV and keep believing the dog shit that downgraded your life into needing that 60 to 70 hours to survive. 

It's self propelling slavery and honestly sad."

"We are living through such intense accelerationism right now (or hypernormalization). I recently listened to a podcast about left shark dancing during the super bowl half time show in 2015. Hearing that it happened in 2015 made my head spin. I couldn't compute that Trump was elected the following year. I feel like I've lived 30 lives in the last 10 years. Sometimes I mistakenly think that there was an extra president in between Obama and Trump because it feels like the change was so extreme."

"The first and only time I've ever turned to alcohol to prepare for and cope with adverse circumstances. As much as I didn't want it to happen, the past decade has absolutely absolved me of the delusion that the American public is capable of making rational, intelligent, long-term decisions for the good of the country, and so something deep in my subconscious knew he was going to win. So I went and stocked up with tons of beer, and by the time the polls closed in my state I was the most intoxicated I've ever been, before or since. The first time he won I was panicking. I spent last November laughing, but the kind of laughing Russell Casse does right before he dies in Independence Day."

"Definitely. And I'd argue that it's not exclusive to 2024. This has long been the case. The 24 hr news cycle has made for endless campaigning and beating stories to death (although some are more valid than others). It's not wonder everything is so gridlocked and partisansed when you have news outlets basically fear mongering and politicians feeding into that. It's like a weird feedback loop that only makes the problems worse."

"I dunno man. So I'm a political junkie and I've been deep in this shit for 10 years, and I think I could spin this dramatically better than they have.

LIke that's the thing. They are genuinely not good propagandists. They're not clever. Not talented.

Much of the talent of the right-wing machine comes from the fact that it isn't top down. It's organic.

Like when people think of the right's success, I think they don't realize that a huge part of this is the network of opportunitsts, like Joe Rogan and many others, who are so much better at this and who are basically simply exploiting an anti-establishment, rather than conservative, niche.

The fact they've gotten where they are says so much mroe about the crumbling state of the estblishment and its infrastructure more than it does any degree of competency from any of these fucking fools.

The Trump admin is just the beneficiary of it, but these are not good propagandists. They fucking suck at it. Really bad. Aside from Trump himself as a person, just the totality of his being, nothing in this administration actually works."

"If he gets pardoned, there is zero reason to not start a Civil War in the streets. There already isn't a reason, IMO, but if he gets pardoned, that means the administration wants him out killing Democrats. And I don't want to hear any "but Martial Law" arguments, because what's the difference if they're murdering us in our homes, anyway?"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Civil war in USA does not solve a loss of NATO to information warfare. Civil War does not fix social media addiction to constant mockery of Donald Trump White House, that Joe Biden is considered boring and not entertaining enough. Civil War just adds action scenes to the MAGA fantasy of even more entertainment. The very murder that this Reddit posting about is the action violence MAGA craves in fiction White House driven by Putin / Russia. ===:::

"This has historically been the assumption, but at this point in history, I genuinely believe the idea that Dem voters are more intellectual than Repubs is simply wrong. And it's largely what gains Dems the reputation as out of touch elitist bastards.

These are Dem voters! Not just college educated suburbanites. I think the failure to speak to people like this is why so much of the Latino vote was lost.

Dems need to learn that they are capable of controlling the narrative. Pick ONE subject and repeat it ad nauseum until Republicans respond. Put THEM on the back foot for once. Ignore their bait the same way Mamdani has been doing and stay focused on just one or two things."

they're the only party in the world that could lose multiple elections to donald trump."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : The election was lost to Russia / Putin manipulaiton of Reddit social media users who can't fight an information war to save their nation. Donald Trump winning is symptom of that Russian information war against reality loss, the nation is living in psychological denial of the loss. And it isn't just USA, it is multiple NATO nations. Hate against humanism and lust for wealth and technology like Donald Trump is an everyday change in society, not just voting days.

Donald Trump is a symptom of anti-reality, fiction... the Russians are attacking nonfiction and science. The other commentary on this is that the Reddit comment does not address the audience, voter problem. Not holding the population accountable for their voting for antics and social media shit talk - the topics of Carl Sagan 1995, Neil Postman 1985. Donald Trump being a center of hate attraction is symptom of a population wide problem. "Political instinct" since March 2013 has been erased in favor of fiction addiction / attraction to deception. ===:::

"The problem is they do not genuinely give a shit about pedophilia or about victims. They only care about using the spectre of pedophilia as a weapon against groups they hate. That's why they're so caught up on labeling LGBT people groomers and on the myth that human trafficking is suburban white kids being tricked into vans by shadowy figures who want to move them across borders. They actively do not care and do not want to stop actual pedophiles. They will in fact go out of their way to protect actual pedophiles. The only reason they even made Epstein part of their nonsense is QAnon and the idea that it would take down a bunch of "liberal elites"."

"I want to stress to people that this belief, for many of his followers, actually predates their beliefs in Donald Trump/MAGA.

The funnel for many of these people was esoteric religious conspiracy communities (e.g. Flat Earth, Theistic Evolutionism, Young Earth Creationism, etc.) into QAnon/MAGA. They were put into Christian Fundamentalist pipelines that shat them out on Donald's doorstep because it was politically exigent and convenient. This was not their inevitable endpoint.

As a result, their founding theory of the world is not that Donald Trump is their big daddy. For so, so many Trumpers, their founding theory is that there is a dark cabal and that a nebulous ***(((they)))*** are trying to hide the true nature of the world from you while participating in ***(((dark pedophilic rituals)))*** in consort with the literal biblical Satan.

**Functionally, they believe that the Jews invented modernity so they could fuck little kids and keep you from knowing God personally. They believe that Donald Trump is the prophet who will bring this cabal to justice under God's eye.**

"I keep pointing this out, it’s insidious how this works. These profiles count on outrage from “the left” to boost their engagement and it works flawlessly.

When thousands of people see the post it drives a percentage of those to the actual account, and some of those will follow for more outrage content. But some will stay because they are on the fence or agree to some extent, and those people become radicalized over time and help spread the content in sympathetic circles. Circles that continue to grow as people are introduced to these accounts by outrage posting.

This is essentially how Trump got elected. Twice. Politics wasn’t so mainstream before him, but every type of media found his antics boosted engagement so they kept feeding us more and more and more, which attracted more viewers. And for every person that watched to laugh there was another thinking “hey, I like this guy”.

It’s repeated through multiple local, state, and federal elections now. The crazy person gets name recognition and memes. That gets them elected.

"These “influencers” don’t need a consistent message. They live in the present and cultivate a vibe in which their team is never wrong. It’s what the audience wants to hear. Orwell described this form of propaganda in “1984”:

“History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”"

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Beyond the time shift aspect (the warnings from the 1985 past of Brave New World coming), the other aspect of Neil Postman is that it revives the best of Orwell.

It isn't about a *person*, the problem is *techniques* and self-awareness of the media consumers (everyone, regardless if even old enough or otherwise legal to vote).

"I am looking in the comments, but nobody has mentioned this:

This public statement was read a few days after Trump met with Vladimir Putin (in Helsinki, I believe?). That that meeting, when asked if Trump trusted his own intelligence network, even though Putin denied being involved in the election, Trump said he "didn't know why it would be Russia". Taking it in context, with what was said around it, it became clear that the President of the United States was saying he trusted Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence community.

This caused a fire storm at the time, and embarrassment for Republicans. Some officials during the first term threatened to resign if he didn't make it clear he trusted the intelligence community. So, they trotted him out there and had him read from a piece of paper.

So, no, he never trusted his own people. He openly admitted to trusting Vladimir Putin more than US intelligence. For any other President in history, they would have resigned in shame and people would have demanded a recall. Now, some people in these comments think this video is fake. Sad times, indeed."

Not to say every person needs to grasp Finnegans Wake, but at least every person who works in media as a content creator or "source of breaking news" needs to be on the same page as James Joyce in year 1924.

"It's more than feeling offended. Trump very much does not want certain plain and simple facts reported. On top of that he very much wants as much control of "the narrative" as possible. To do that through government power is radically contrary to the Constitution and the principles our nation is founded on."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : These well articulate comments exist on Reddit and other social media, but they are not entertaining and amusing. And if you do make them entertaining and amusing (South Park), you exploit the audience into a mental reset exploit of the human brain. People become so attracted to the mocking and insulting itself, that they abandon goodness in favor of the total mockery. As Neil Postman describes in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" when Ronald Regan was in his second term of office (1985). It's hard for people to swallow, becauase people don't grasp that *hate for Donald Trump* is media content, media engagement, to hate and insult Trump. It is a *compusive exploit* of **the opposition**, that's what Neil Postman's core point was - it is a function of **technology itself**, stop blaming Donald Trump, the audience / We The People - have sold out thinking system for a tone and style of mocking. We have abandoned *boring nonfiction* for *I don't give a fuck fiction*. Nonfiction has never been a good seller in almost any medium, why do people expect social media society to have solved that problem without taking it head-on by pounding people over the head (every American age 12 to 120) with Neil Postman!

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Yes. Locking up free thinking people who are stressed by Putin and Trump behavior is part of the Russian playbook.

People are claiming that everything happening in reality is actually a *distraction from Epstein "the list"*, when it is far more likely the inverse. Sex sells, media content of sex puts Trump in the center of attention, rich men (status symbol) sex conquest sells better. People actually wanting to give voice to girls on social media have had since October 8, 2013 to quote Malala's book about empowring girls to stand up to elder men (Taliban rulers, Donald Trump elder rulers, Putin elder rulers) as a global movement. But people are attracted to (media ecology attraction) rich men sex content... that is the "distraction". Also note this comment was made in a community about films, comics, and video games (Batman). That is the distraction, bread and content circus. Trump White House / Surkovian governing is feeding the human mind exploit of total mockery entertainment, mocking back, not willing to turn away from amusement and entertainment of Ronald Reagan in 1985, the year 1985 when Neil Postman wrote his 184 page book "Amusing Ourselves To Death"...

Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act.

3. Add more Fox News to Fox News nation
4. Add more absurd antics to MAGA, fight Surkovian governing with more absurd surreal fleeing from reality in favor of meme mockery.

"Wasn't Trump president for 4 of those years? He could have released the information in those files, since it would have exonerated him completely... instead of him having to go around for the past decade screaming "Russia, Russia, Russia' and "Russian Hoax".

"Easy yo make jokes, but all I see is blood money to pay folks to become the spearhead of an authoritarian regime, whose sole purpose is to enrich a very small fraction of us.

These are folks who fund and arm those who murdering Palestinians by starvation. Slow agonizing death.

Evil people doing evil things."

* :::=== RoundSparrow_Commentary : Acting as if "evil" has a purpose. Evil is a mistake, evil is misunderstandings. the only cure is teaching, education, repeating. Fighting (and willing to die for teaching, like Malala in Pakistan). " to enrich a very small fraction of us" - Cambodia Killing Fields isn't about wealth. Evil is about egomania, a misunderstanding prized, prizing ficiton, an addiction to power and mania of hate. Being thrilled by war, violence, chasing down immigrants with ICE and concentration camps as entertainment amusement. People don't become rich, they live in constant emotional insecurity and hate (dog eat dog competition). Many who wage out-group hate actually believe they are earning a way into Heaven in an afterlife, and Earth is a temporary proving military ground for Jesus Judgement Day (Levant religion thinking, all science fiction, people confused what is nonfiction). Evil is all a product of failure to grasp and understand here-on-Earth compassion learning and thinking. MAGA calls liberals evil. There are no evil people, there are massive problems of education and not grasping thinking. “Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.” ― Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil ===:::

"No they aren't very smart, but their lack of intelligence does not even explain a fraction of the shit MAGA is doing. No, it's more than ignorance, it's more than being dumb. It's more than sheer stubbornness. They're hateful people to their very core. Angry, vindictive, selfish, sadistic trolls who try to drag everyone else down into their swamp of deplorability so they don't have to pull themselves out. They have had thousands of opportunities to listen to the truth and the facts and they still twist themselves into knots trying to excuse Trump's behavior. They aren't good people who were led astray, this is who they have always been on the inside. That's the biggest and most impactful reason Trump is so popular with them: he reminds them of themselves; They see themselves in him. He says what they always wanted to say. He empowers them and makes them feel like they have everything all figured out, while he and his billionaire buddies steal every penny out of their pocket. He makes them feel smart and superior to experts and actual intelligent people, he is milking the Dunning-Kruger effect till it's bone dry."
