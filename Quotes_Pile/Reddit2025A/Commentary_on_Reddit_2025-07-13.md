https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1lz43mx/we_should_be_alarmed_how_dementia_is_ravaging_the/

Reddit community created title: out-group dementia. No vocabulary of Andrew Postman, Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan, Peter Pomerantsev, Christopher Wylie.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1lz36zs/four_years_of_boring_old_joe_biden_competently/

Call out that Joe Biden is boring, but complete avoidance of Andrew Postman February 2017, Neil Postman 1985. Zero self-awareness that being angry and hate-filled towards July 2025 situation is itself popular social media / electric news media engagement. The "cleverness" context of the Reddit community also lacks self-awareness of what Hannah Arendt 1951 said about "superior tactical cleverness" related to totalitarianism and *cleverness* was also called out by 1940 film Great Dictator famous speech (Charlie Chaplin).

https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1lz16pq/fans_in_the_stadium_boo_as_the_us_anthem_gets/

Zero concept of Surkovian government year 2012 Russia techniques. No ability to mention 2013 onward publications by Peter Pomerantsev. Booing and hate are engagement, content power, hate is central core focus of Kremlin / MAGA / Donald Trump power. [Donald Trump is playing Tony Clifton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Clifton) (Andy Kaufman) and Reddit community **eats the Surkovian Onions** without associating that it is a form of Reality TV to be Tony Clifton. Tony Clifton style character in the Russian Surkovian screenplay of year 2012 techniques.

https://old.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1lz585z/trump_forces_himself_into_chelseas_trophy_lift/

Trump inserting himself into international event. Zero self-awareness of Reddit community that this is Russian Surkovian *Tony Clifton* behavior, that drawing hate, mocking, insulting and self-harm to USA and Trump himself is part of the Kremlin reality performance / war against reality.

Mock Mock Mockery. People on Reddit do not assert that this White House content is year 2012 Surkovian techniques of Russia. Kremlin / White House / Billionaires something absurd / surreal / against reality at the right timing of the topic, get the population (including those too young or otherwise not legal to vote) to react back. Reddit community is *eating the Surkoviain Onions* of this technique. "Stephen Miller's Cuck Chair" in the screenshot reaction comment. Sexual fetish for July 14 Epstein rich powerful wealthy lords cultivating in the social media consumers society.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1lzm3qr/the_year_is_2025/

"The Year is 2025" as if a fiction story opening. Anti-reality.

Constant social media society emphasizing of 1938 Nazi Germany. Which had no computerized social media. Almost all of White House and Kremlin power comes from media machines, which are mentioned in the posting - but not a peep about information warfare and Kremlin "War Against Reality" since March 2013 / Operation Matthew 4:19 since November 2018. People are so engaged in mocking back at the symbols deep in their mind, describing Hell, they do not want to *remove the Hell*... it is symbolism content engagement. Neil Postman was correct in [1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death).

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1m0bn71/silly_kate/

Very simplistic anti-information clickbait Reddit title makes it to front page. Portrays USA situation as "silly", as in entertaining and amusing. Anti-serious, no-identity social media mocking. USA social media users have Surkovian onion breath and do not care to learn of Neil Postman / Peter P of how this *eating out of the hands of antics politicians* is the basis of Russian power for Putin / information warfare. Insulting and mocking MAGA / Trump White House is not resisting, it is the very basis of Surkovian governing. "Murder By Words" framing implies some sports game mentality of scoring huge points, screen game simulacra of resistance.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/1m0fgwj/oh_we_are_talking_about_it/

JD Vance quoted from year 2021. The "Aged Like Milk" is very often about mocking and insulting, not about serious important focus. There are often Reddit community comments about **Project 2025**, but the recency bias of serious topics (that truly harm the population) is so strong that you will not see people bring up the [**2019 book by Christopher Wylie with "Plot To Break America"** in the very title](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/73625651-mindf-ck-cambridge-analytica-and-the-plot-to-break-america). And how JD Vance is using psychological manipulation techniques in his Twitter messaging. Further, that September 2021 Twitter context is the raging COVID-19 global pandemic vacination. The "Aged Like Milk" community does not overcome the *serious barrier* and *recency bias* combined to cite August 24, 2018 **serious disclosures** use of the same Twitter platform being used to harm and kill Americans with disease (Cambridge Analytica style) thinking and emotional manipulation. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

Reddit is amusement mill doing amusement washing, as are all the social media websites. The very interface of the smartphone / iPad / tablet and framing taints everything with a entertainment amusement tone. Neil Postman's deepest emphasis in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death". How serious information is not grasped by the audience as there seems to be an amusement entertainment kind of hangover that dominates.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByAOC/comments/1m0fy08/aocs_legal_battle/

***Murdered by AOC***, more of this video game fiction communications. Anti-reality. Gives the social media audience sense that they are spectators to entertaining sports scores. Dilutes authenticity, reality, science, factual, reason thinking (Great Seal USA founding fathers emphasis) in favor of amusement. This specific subject is about **lawyers, legal systems, discovery, court cases** where Donald Trump is never put into prison for his crimes and wins popularity for domination and shit-talking on social media. [This focus on rich lawyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoU8EKpUJhk) and famous people (AOC) taking on Donald Trump makes this a wealthy vs wealthy spectator passive social media / news media consumption sport. *We The People* sit on our ass watch AOC "murder" Trump on our media devices for a decade, which is not true reality.  All Russian Surkovian year 2012, Reddit community unable to say "are we living in a simulacra, full of bullshit faiths, as we all sit on our social media machines vibrating  (intimate touching of screen) and notifying us of shallow memes while Putin and Trump **consolidate wealth + power** since [November 2012 professional doctorates of psychology (Cambridge) mind-fucking scheme of Kremlin /Trump Operation Matthew 4:19](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/)"? Living in a simulacra of resistance, not facing up to Peter P's books and writings from year 2014, Andrew Postman 2017, Neil Postman 1985.

Another one about legal cases being amusing and entertaining for social media users to be content consumers. How Donald Trump has made everything entertaining front page of Reddit content.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1m0gmqz/this_one_is_a_lovely_combination_of_bootstraps/

This built up since March 2013, MAGA growing, the Fox News / Rupert Murdoch problem known. But this is now Reddit doing what Rupert Murdoch finds profitable: laughing at *conservative tears*, inverting the *amused at liberal tears*. It is Americans Hate Americans, Americans Insult Americans, following the Donald Trump Twitter Role Model of social media behavior. It is not cult deprogramming, it is not asserting Andrew Postman February 2017 and Neil Postman 1985... it is eating out of he hands of Kremlin Surkovian mind-fuck since March 2013 deployment on Reddit by the Internet Research Agency! USA hates USA messaging. Not crying in shared suffering of compassion, not [declaring hate is always bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iww5eeEjxiI) (**hate is mentioned in this very Reddit content linked**) and repeating [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1954 teachings](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) about ALL hate by ALL people is bad, but encouraging a *hate harder* attitude of Putin's mind-fuck information warfare. Surkovian onion breath.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1m0ense/hey_way_to_go/

Emphasizing punishment, hate, war against Americans on Reddit social media. Eating right out of the 5,000 Russian screen game simulacra patterns since March 2013 to self-harm USA. Unable to cite anything about Russian information warfare and how Donald Trump has ties to Putin and USA year 2025 situation isn't "American Politics" (which the Reddit posting has as question), but Surkovian mind-fuck and aftermath of complete loss of information warfare (with [evidence of MULTIPLE NATO nations, not just USA](https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/)). Also making the only solution about civil war ending in year 1865 where all people have now died of old age, makes it a passive (only consume memes) social media manipulation that active measures against USA, information warfare, is not [ongoing here and now currently](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/russia-ai-hurricane-milton-disinformation) by Kremlin and White House using Surkovian methods.


&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1m0tq36/congestive_heart_failure/

Top of front page. Can not stay focused on Donald Trump trusting Putin, the entire White House (JD Vance is better?) using manipulation and antics, how MAGA / Trumpism has been going on for over a decade... the forest for the trees. Instead, fixated on the very power of mocking and insulting that Trump is powered by. One single man fixated. The cult problems of MAGA go way beyond him being removed from office or death, it is media itself cult (Neil Postman 1985, confirmed by Andrew Postman February 2017). This has gone on so long, people are so engaged in every single move and shake of the White House and not dealing with the society-wide media addiction that has *lead to* the kind of Twitter-think simplicity of MAGA and USA 2025.

**"Congestive Heart Failure?"** - Reddit is long-form social media, not built upon 140 character Twitter and 300 character Bluesky. And "White People Twitter" context is not specific to Donald Trump (so the title combined with subreddit name does not imply Donald Trump). But that is what social media society of July 2025 can not see, Donald Trump is such a domination of media / behavior / thinking / attitudes / faith / religion in USA 2025 - that the title doesn't have to say **"Donald Trump this week showing signs of Congestive Heart Failure?"** It is a clickbait nation, not the mainstream media here, but Reddit community itself creating and favoring these "Trump is the center of attention" titles / mindsets and upvoting this to front page.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1m0p7ij/the_struggles_inside_the_two_brain_cells_of_a/

Front page of reddit saying that Americans have only 2 brain cells. Cult of mocking MAGA, cult of behaving like Donald Trump and Elon Musk on social machines insulting the out-group. Instead of offering sincere compassion for Russia / Surkovian mind-fuck of information war since March 2013 - all USA population does in July 2025 is attack upon the least-educated and most injured by Kremlin information warfare. Kicking Americans while they are down. Those with free time, spare time, to use Reddit - are upvoting and commenting how insults and hate (behaving like role model Donald Trump on Truth Social / Twitter) will improve the USA situation. Eating right out of the destroy-NATO brain exploits of Surkov students / Russia / Putin. Extremely powerful cloud computing servers and software (Reddit) are being used to dehumanize real people in the USA. This is the very scheme of the Internet Research Agency in March 2013, to make USA people hate and dehumanize USA people and not teach Peter P's books, articles, videos. That self-harm would come by out-group hate patterns of [the 5,000 social machine screen games](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446).

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/GetNoted/comments/1m0qros/tell_me_you_are_in_a_cult_without_saying_you_are/

Outright declare that USA has a massive cult problem, but do not use social media to be serious about information warfare to discuss the hundreds of published books on how to deal with a cult. Let Kremlin March 2013 onward media invasion mind-fuck Americans and sit by on social media for over a decade doing nothing positive to **defend the USA and NATO partners against Putin's ability to create self-harm media cults**. Amusment washing the cult problem.  At this point, there a are cults of Reddit and Bluesky and other social media systems that are in the media addiction of mocking MAGA and Trump cults. Media cult vs. media cult. Like Israel Torah media cult (Synagogue cult) vs. Palestine Quran media cult (Mosque). Both mocking each other as out-group cults using media systems / media venues.

*We The People* are in the electric media systems simulacra originated by the Kremlin Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica in late 2012. Also study [Rick Roderick 1993, "Self Under Siege", 7 hour video](https://rickroderick.org/300-guide-the-self-under-siege-1993/) presentation. You are LIVING in this world of abandoned reason thinking and Super Mario parenting morality (social media screen game simulacra addiction).

Makes it to the front page of Reddit, comedic framing ("Timmy") of how entertaining and amusing this mockery is. Surkvian onion breath of USA social media users. [Tim Pool media content duped to work for Russia / Kremlin](https://apnews.com/article/russian-interference-presidential-election-influencers-trump-999435273dd39edf7468c6aa34fad5dd) and here it is, Johnny on the spot, War Against Reality / [Contradictory Vaudeville](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html). Without one drop of Reddit poster (community) / American social media users invoking: Surkov year 2012, Peter Pomerantsev 2014, Adam Curtis 2014. It is endless eating of the Surkovian simulacra onions and egoism of mocking and insulting (which is Reddit community adopting the very values of Donald Trump White House: Mocking sincerity, mockery, insulting).
