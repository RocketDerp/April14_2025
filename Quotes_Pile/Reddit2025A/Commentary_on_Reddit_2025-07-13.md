https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1lz43mx/we_should_be_alarmed_how_dementia_is_ravaging_the/

Reddit community created title: out-group dementia. No vocabulary of Andrew Postman, Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan, Peter Pomerantsev, Christopher Wylie.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1lz36zs/four_years_of_boring_old_joe_biden_competently/

Call out that Joe Biden is boring, but complete avoidance of Andrew Postman February 2017, Neil Postman 1985. Zero self-awareness that being angry and hate-filled towards July 2025 situation is itself popular social media / electric news media engagement. The "cleverness" context of the Reddit community also lacks self-awareness of what Hannah Arendt 1951 said about "superior tactical cleverness" related to totalitarianism and *cleverness* was also called out by 1940 film Great Dictator famous speech (Charlie Chaplin).

https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1lz16pq/fans_in_the_stadium_boo_as_the_us_anthem_gets/

Zero concept of Surkovian government year 2012 Russia techniques. No ability to mention 2013 onward publications by Peter Pomerantsev. Booing and hate are engagement, content power, hate is central core focus of Kremlin / MAGA / Donald Trump power. [Donald Trump is playing Tony Clifton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Clifton) (Andy Kaufman) and Reddit community **eats the Surkovian Onions** without associating that it is a form of Reality TV to be Tony Clifton. Tony Clifton style character in the Russian Surkovian screenplay of year 2012 techniques.

https://old.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1lz585z/trump_forces_himself_into_chelseas_trophy_lift/

Trump inserting himself into international event. Zero self-awareness of Reddit community that this is Russian Surkovian *Tony Clifton* behavior, that drawing hate, mocking, insulting and self-harm to USA and Trump himself is part of the Kremlin reality performance / war against reality.

Mock Mock Mockery. People on Reddit do not assert that this White House content is year 2012 Surkovian techniques of Russia. Kremlin / White House / Billionaires something absurd / surreal / against reality at the right timing of the topic, get the population (including those too young or otherwise not legal to vote) to react back. Reddit community is *eating the Surkoviain Onions* of this technique. "Stephen Miller's Cuck Chair" in the screenshot reaction comment. Sexual fetish for July 14 Epstein rich powerful wealthy lords cultivating in the social media consumers society.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/BlueskySkeets/comments/1lzm3qr/the_year_is_2025/

"The Year is 2025" as if a fiction story opening. Anti-reality.

Constant social media society emphasizing of 1938 Nazi Germany. Which had no computerized social media. Almost all of White House and Kremlin power comes from media machines, which are mentioned in the posting - but not a peep about information warfare and Kremlin "War Against Reality" since March 2013 / Operation Matthew 4:19 since November 2018. People are so engaged in mocking back at the symbols deep in their mind, describing Hell, they do not want to *remove the Hell*... it is symbolism content engagement. Neil Postman was correct in [1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death).

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1m0bn71/silly_kate/

Very simplistic anti-information clickbait Reddit title makes it to front page. Portrays USA situation as "silly", as in entertaining and amusing. Anti-serious, no-identity social media mocking. USA social media users have Surkovian onion breath and do not care to learn of Neil Postman / Peter P of how this *eating out of the hands of antics politicians* is the basis of Russian power for Putin / information warfare. Insulting and mocking MAGA / Trump White House is not resisting, it is the very basis of Surkovian governing. "Murder By Words" framing implies some sports game mentality of scoring huge points, screen game simulacra of resistance.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/1m0fgwj/oh_we_are_talking_about_it/

JD Vance quoted from year 2021. The "Aged Like Milk" is very often about mocking and insulting, not about serious important focus. There are often Reddit community comments about **Project 2025**, but the recency bias of serious topics (that truly harm the population) is so strong that you will not see people bring up the [**2019 book by Christopher Wylie with "Plot To Break America"** in the very title](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/73625651-mindf-ck-cambridge-analytica-and-the-plot-to-break-america). And how JD Vance is using psychological manipulation techniques in his Twitter messaging. Further, that September 2021 Twitter context is the raging COVID-19 global pandemic vacination. The "Aged Like Milk" community does not overcome the *serious barrier* and *recency bias* combined to cite August 24, 2018 **serious disclosures** use of the same Twitter platform being used to harm and kill Americans with disease (Cambridge Analytica style) thinking and emotional manipulation. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

Reddit is amusement mill doing amusement washing, as are all the social media websites. The very interface of the smartphone / iPad / tablet and framing taints everything with a entertainment amusement tone. Neil Postman's deepest emphasis in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death". How serious information is not grasped by the audience as there seems to be an amusement entertainment kind of hangover that dominates.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByAOC/comments/1m0fy08/aocs_legal_battle/

***Murdered by AOC***, more of this video game fiction communications. Anti-reality. Gives the social media audience sense that they are spectators to entertaining sports scores. Dilutes authenticity, reality, science, factual, reason thinking (Great Seal USA founding fathers emphasis) in favor of amusement. This specific subject is about **lawyers, legal systems, discovery, court cases** where Donald Trump is never put into prison for his crimes and wins popularity for domination and shit-talking on social media. [This focus on rich lawyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoU8EKpUJhk) and famous people (AOC) taking on Donald Trump makes this a wealthy vs wealthy spectator passive social media / news media consumption sport. *We The People* sit on our ass watch AOC "murder" Trump on our media devices for a decade, which is not true reality.  All Russian Surkovian year 2012, Reddit community unable to say "are we living in a simulacra, full of bullshit faiths, as we all sit on our social media machines vibrating  (intimate touching of screen) and notifying us of shallow memes while Putin and Trump **consolidate wealth + power** since [November 2012 professional doctorates of psychology (Cambridge) mind-fucking scheme of Kremlin /Trump Operation Matthew 4:19](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/)"? Living in a simulacra of resistance, not facing up to Peter P's books and writings from year 2014, Andrew Postman 2017, Neil Postman 1985.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1m0gmqz/this_one_is_a_lovely_combination_of_bootstraps/

This built up since March 2013, MAGA growing, the Fox News / Rupert Murdoch problem known. But this is now Reddit doing what Rupert Murdoch finds profitable: laughing at *conservative tears*, inverting the *amused at liberal tears*. It is Americans Hate Americans, Americans Insult Americans, following the Donald Trump Twitter Role Model of social media behavior. It is not cult deprogramming, it is not asserting Andrew Postman February 2017 and Neil Postman 1985... it is eating out of he hands of Kremlin Surkovian mind-fuck since March 2013 deployment on Reddit by the Internet Research Agency! USA hates USA messaging. Not crying in shared suffering of compassion, not [declaring hate is always bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iww5eeEjxiI) (**hate is mentioned in this very Reddit content linked**) and repeating [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1954 teachings](../Martin_Luther_King_Jr_quotes0.md) about ALL hate by ALL people is bad, but encouraging a *hate harder* attitude of Putin's mind-fuck information warfare. Surkovian onion breath.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1m0ense/hey_way_to_go/

Emphasizing punishment, hate, war against Americans on Reddit social media. Eating right out of the 5,000 Russian screen game simulacra patterns since March 2013 to self-harm USA. Unable to cite anything about Russian information warfare and how Donald Trump has ties to Putin and USA year 2025 situation isn't "American Politics" (which the Reddit posting has as question), but Surkovian mind-fuck and aftermath of complete loss of information warfare (with [evidence of MULTIPLE NATO nations, not just USA](https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/)). Also making the only solution about civil war ending in year 1865 where all people have now died of old age, makes it a passive (only consume memes) social media manipulation that active measures against USA, information warfare, is not [ongoing here and now currently](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/russia-ai-hurricane-milton-disinformation) by Kremlin and White House using Surkovian methods.


&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1m0tq36/congestive_heart_failure/

Top of front page. Can not stay focused on Donald Trump trusting Putin, the entire White House (JD Vance is better?) using manipulation and antics, how MAGA / Trumpism has been going on for over a decade... the forest for the trees. Instead, fixated on the very power of mocking and insulting that Trump is powered by. One single man fixated. The cult problems of MAGA go way beyond him being removed from office or death, it is media itself cult (Neil Postman 1985, confirmed by Andrew Postman February 2017). This has gone on so long, people are so engaged in every single move and shake of the White House and not dealing with the society-wide media addiction that has *lead to* the kind of Twitter-think simplicity of MAGA and USA 2025.

**"Congestive Heart Failure?"** - Reddit is long-form social media, not built upon 140 character Twitter and 300 character Bluesky. And "White People Twitter" context is not specific to Donald Trump (so the title combined with subreddit name does not imply Donald Trump). But that is what social media society of July 2025 can not see, Donald Trump is such a domination of media / behavior / thinking / attitudes / faith / religion in USA 2025 - that the title doesn't have to say **"Donald Trump this week showing signs of Congestive Heart Failure?"** It is a clickbait nation, not the mainstream media here, but Reddit community itself creating and favoring these "Trump is the center of attention" titles / mindsets and upvoting this to front page.

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1m0p7ij/the_struggles_inside_the_two_brain_cells_of_a/

Front page of reddit saying that Americans have only 2 brain cells. Cult of mocking MAGA, cult of behaving like Donald Trump and Elon Musk on social machines insulting the out-group. Instead of offering sincere compassion for Russia / Surkovian mind-fuck of information war since March 2013 - all USA population does in July 2025 is attack upon the least-educated and most injured by Kremlin information warfare. Kicking Americans while they are down. Those with free time, spare time, to use Reddit - are upvoting and commenting how insults and hate (behaving like role model Donald Trump on Truth Social / Twitter) will improve the USA situation. Eating right out of the destroy-NATO brain exploits of Surkov students / Russia / Putin. Extremely powerful cloud computing servers and software (Reddit) are being used to dehumanize real people in the USA. This is the very scheme of the Internet Research Agency in March 2013, to make USA people hate and dehumanize USA people and not teach Peter P's books, articles, videos. That self-harm would come by out-group hate patterns of [the 5,000 social machine screen games](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446).

&nbsp;

https://old.reddit.com/r/GetNoted/comments/1m0qros/tell_me_you_are_in_a_cult_without_saying_you_are/

Outright declare that USA has a massive cult problem, but do not use social media to be serious about information warfare to discuss the hundreds of published books on how to deal with a cult. Let Kremlin March 2013 onward media invasion mind-fuck Americans and sit by on social media for over a decade doing nothing positive to **defend the USA and NATO partners against Putin's ability to create self-harm media cults**. Amusment washing the cult problem.  At this point, there a are cults of Reddit and Bluesky and other social media systems that are in the media addiction of mocking MAGA and Trump cults. Media cult vs. media cult. Like Israel Torah media cult (Synagogue cult) vs. Palestine Quran media cult (Mosque). Both mocking each other as out-group cults using media systems / media venues.

Donald Trump and RFK Jr are letting measles and other diseases be welcomed, but rich men sex games are the sustained focus (sustained so far) people are concerned about. Malala has given voice to age 13 girls all over the world and doesn't have the "rich men sex games" content audiences desire, that is my observation. USA social media audiences want to hear about private jets, private islands, and what Malala is confronting is a world wide reformation on the topic of young girls being manipulated by elders like age 79 Donald Trump. Pizzagate sex nonsense is the kind of topics given social media voice when what Malala is trying to do is build a network of young girls who have support systems and can speak up and be educated about their own abuse (which can go on within their very own house / family, not on some private island and rich men's private jets). Malala's focus is about prevention and immediate disclosure, not pizzagate style rumor mills.

"They lie in their sleep" - but that's exaclty the Fox News MAGA talking point, that *liberals lie, libtards lie*. Social media users with no-identity anonymous accounts on Reddit lie and deceive constantly. ChatGPT lies, business owners use public relations firms to lie. The clergy / Church / Mosque lies. Exactly what part of USA society is attracted to nonfiction? At what point do you stop making this an out-group issue and wake up that the human brain / mind has an attraction to fiction and manipulation liars as leaders? Instead of making this an **out-group of Torah fiction vs. Quran fiction vs. Bible fiction vs. Upanishads fiction** - you *wake up* to what James Joyce was iterating in Finnegans Wake about all mythology and fiction, and University of Toronto's [Marshall McLuhan was saying in the 1968 book "War And Peace in the Global Village" about electric media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village) (Reddit, Twitter, Ttruth Social, Fox News, etc) and Finnegans **Wake**?

That is the values of Donald Trump, MAGA, Fox News: *insulting, hate, mocking, LOL at suffering of liberal taars.* Now popular with all Americans in July 2025. Fox News found huge profit in mocking and hate, now every media platform has found it to be the biggest engagement, best selling content. All media has adopted Fox News MAGA values, it just took more time for every media system to "catch up" that fiction and hate is popular.

Reddit social media users upvoting people realizing that **Reality Itself** is being lost, witnessing the experience of loss of **reality**, yet they can't see beyond mocking tree after tree in streaming meme networks (Reddit, Bluesky, etc) that it is a FOREST of EVERYONE behaving this way regarding reality. That [Cambridge Analytica worked with Russia to wage a war of 5,000 alternate reality fiction screen games](https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446) against humanity.

Anti-reality narative, as if Joe Biden (active POTUS) in July 2024 (and August 2024, September 2024, October 2024) would have covered this up before the November 2024 election. What total social media society bullshit. "What are your thoughts?" title social media engagement technique. 50501 shows so many signs of being a *simulacra of resistance* and entirely avoids promoting [Jen Senko's 2016 book and film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad), Neil Postman 1985 / Andrew Postman February 2017, Peter Pomerantsev, Adam Curitis 2014, Christopher Wylie 2019 books, etc. Just jumps right into the Donald Trump / MAGA / [Kremlin Unreality bullshit](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/) instead of addressing the society-wide addiction to hate upon Donald Trump / hate intiated by Donald Trump + MAGA. Trump is a magnet for: hate, unreality via media, mass dehumanization of "the others".

Made it to top of Reddit front page a second time, very fast upvoting. Biden had months to analyze this high-profile event, very unlikely Joe Biden would have not disclosed if there was any evidence of it being faked.

Front page of Reddit from other social media: **Lessons for Corporate America Executives** on how to be better liars, deceivers, manipulators of the audience with entertainment and fiction. Social media users are behaving as they do with Donald Trump, JD Vance, Elon Musk, White House 2025 - *give us the fiction lies and Surkovian contradictions we crave as an audience every hour of every day, CEO*.

It isn'tjust Donald Trump CEO / President of the company sex lives that crowds flock to, Epstein attraction of rich white men sex antics. Crowds eat this up, just as they do Donald Trump.

**Why would Elon Musk** not want to keep the most popular topics and his personal street cred on top media topics? Reddit society is eating right out of the hands of **Trickle Down Content** from the rich. Everything is media ecology. Surkovian governing of society in action, every media platform reacting to every move and shake of the White House (including Elon Musk DOGE). People adore the "tea" and "scoop" sex lives of rich white men topics, Musk sex life, Trump sex life, etc. This is what people voted for in year 2024, a thrilling white house of antics and Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton.

Putin media invasion continues and nobody in USA is alarmed or feels the need to use words like: defend, rescue of Americans.

"Voice of reason" plastered as heading on the content. This is NOT in any way the voice of reason thinkiing system, this is *voice of total mockery, voice of mocking*.  www.GreatSealUSA.com discusses comprehending the voice of reason from USA founding fathers.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1m6to5z/these_are_deeply_unserious_people/

"Deeply Unserious People" on a social media platform where people are so cowardly and non-serious about truth that they hide their real names (cowering, bravery absent) while billionaires on social media like Donald Trump and Elon Musk use their real name. Such unserious people who can't quote Neil Postman 1985 / Andrew Postman February 2017, Peter Pomerantsev, [Adam Curitis 2014](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html), Christopher Wylie 2019 books, etc. All the unserious people with MAGA values do is mock "conservative tears" and "liberal tears" in out-group fashion (eating the Surkovian onions, contradictory performances) and not look at Surkovian Russian governing and recognize the patterns.
