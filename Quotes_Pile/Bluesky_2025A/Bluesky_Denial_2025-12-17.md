"Psyops, lol, nope, these people are just gullible and selfish bigots." - Russia is laughing away at your "LOL, nope" denial of the Ukraine war and direct warfare on Twitter and Reddit and Facebook and YouTube and Bluesky and.... Denial USA. Russia won. #SurkovSaysA  #Psyops gloating in #Newsweek https://www.newsweek.com/russia-president-vladimir-putin-election-americans-1327793

* This is a reply to a Bluesky posting that made it to the front page top of Reddit in under 90 minutes. https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1ppazqc/maga_was_the_greatest_psyop_ever_perpetrated_on/ - with little engagement on Bluesky itself. On Blueksy only 9 / 4 / 37 in 2 hours <img width="994" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32cf656a-5079-4851-aef1-53135966d4ae" />

"Whatevs bro. Bigots. And Morons"

An entire nation of people who welcome Russian information warfare into their home, feed it to their children since March 2013 without resisting in any way. #SinceMarch2013 

#OutGroupMoron MAGA calls you moron. Everyone a moron nation.
