# Reply Trump Voters *not victims*, Trump good for voters

Ok, so this reply tries to make that case (assertion) that Trump leading the USA is good for ANYONE. Outside of mind-fucked self-owned people like Putin / Musk / Murdoch - I do not think Trump is in any way good for any person. Even Putin is self-harming with Trump, Russia is in danger with Trump's runaway faith in fiction storytelling. Anyone can feed Trump fiction and he has access to the USA military. The very idea that ANYONE living on Earth, or USA, is not victims to Trump is a gross misunderstanding of the "forest for the trees" of the situation. It is to be so fixated on Trump that you think he actually is winning. Which is Trump's very own propaganda: That he is a winner. “We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning" - March 2, 2016 - before November 2016 election. https://macleans.ca/politics/washington/how-donald-trump-happened/

No, every person on Earth is not winning when Trump has the power over the population and systems of the USA. This is not a minor or trivial topic here. And the whole messaging response is to trivialize the topic of billionaire psychological operations against "We The People" (just as Neil Postman discuses: "Therein is our problem, for television is at its most trivial and, therefore, most dangerous" ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985, page 16).

My response: "MAGA is based on feelings of self-victimhood, and the term Psyops implies that Trump voters are victims. They're not. "

Your fixation on "orange skin color", black skin color, brown is missing the entire point.

Look at the great context, this is their reply after linking the December 20, 2013 article on The Atlantic about gender / women and not it being race / orange skin / black skin / white skin that is the basis of Putin's information war. See the image context of asserting The Atlantic article.

# Re-asserting Context

The conversation started as a reply to: **"Psyops, lol, nope, these people are just gullible and selfish bigots."**

Downplaying Russia. "lol, nope!" and every off-Bluesky reply factual link about Russia was downplayed (or "played dumb" about women and MAGA Christian motivations). And the "War and Peace" reply being the ace in the hole to downplay everything as a simulacra game / ARG. This Bluesky user expects me to be "these people are just gullible" when quoting War and Peace book to me when this is my Bluesky profile:

War and Peace in Global Bluesky \W\W\W... **"these people are just gullible"**, sure. But NOT YOU on Bluesky, right? Just the WOMAN who is being mocked with "LOL", Americans are dumb and got fucked over by Trump - cheer-leading!

Women have a long history of being courageous truth-tellers.  Dictators, oligarchs and their allies lie, smear and attack women who hold them accountable.

Women’s rights fall as authoritarian regimes rise. 

Hold the line.

They conceal thier public messages from search engines / non-users of Bluesky. Very suspicious. Especially when going around on MAGA topics and saying hyper-banal tiny-short messages that MAGA is NOT being manipulated by { Musk (richest man in the world [going after "Woke Women"](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/13/elon-musk-s-ambition-repopulating-the-planet-and-destroying-the-woke-virus_6714239_4.html)), Putin, Murdoch } : "Psyops, lol, nope, these people are just gullible and selfish bigots." - As if Elon Musk "mind virus" isn't a Psyops information / psycological warfare decleration.

(User profile of this mocking-blocking user is a bird with dark username meanings)

Every reply on the thread about USA MAGA was denial that Rupert Murdoch manipulates MAGA / psychological operations against MAGA. Musk, Putin, Trump, MAGA - it's all gas-lighting of Americans. And this woman admits it and feels abused by her government / billionaires.  

1. May 30, 2022 - how billionaires are forming a MAGA alliance to manipulate people into believing MAGA is good for them: https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/03/billionaires-extra-power-media-ownership-elon-musk

2. Past 5 days: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/13/opinion/gop-women-misogyny-problem.html "The Republican Party has a misogyny problem. Congressional members like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace have been"

&nbsp;

And about a MAGA woman being manipulated by white men: "Psyops, lol, nope, these people are just gullible and selfish bigots." started this whole conversation. Denial abounds that women are being systemically manipulated / psychological operations to put power and wealth in Trump / Musk / Murdoch / Putin hands.
