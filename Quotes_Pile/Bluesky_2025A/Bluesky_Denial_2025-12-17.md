"Psyops, lol, nope, these people are just gullible and selfish bigots." - Russia is laughing away at your "LOL, nope" denial of the Ukraine war and direct warfare on Twitter and Reddit and Facebook and YouTube and Bluesky and....

* This is a reply to a Bluesky posting that made it to the front page top of Reddit in under 90 minutes. https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1ppazqc/maga_was_the_greatest_psyop_ever_perpetrated_on/ - with little engagement on Bluesky itself.

"Whatevs bro. Bigots. And Morons"

An entire nation of people who welcome Russian information warfare into their home, feed it to their children since March 2013 without resisting in any way. #SinceMarch2013 

#OutGroupMoron MAGA calls you moron. Everyone a moron nation.

My response: "MAGA is based on feelings of self-victimhood, and the term Psyops implies that Trump voters are victims. They're not. "

My response:

"We all have a responsibility to not be racists. It’s not always easy, but MAGA embraced it. They are not victims."

The problem is #Christmas 

You don't need to have a skin color or #racial difference to form hate-groups like Bluesky ( Hate MAGA) vs. Twitter (MAGA)

"1 John 4:20" Bible verse issue

I have lived in north Africa #ArabSpring2010 and Middle East to study this.

The #Islamic terrorists in #Algeria don't have a different skin color / race from those they { hate butcher murder deport }

Racial and skin color is superficial / shallow. "Orange Skin" fxiation.

1. Fox News fiction vs.

My response:

"I don’t even know what you’re talking about."

Yes, because social media is the very problem. High-speed reactionary, you are programmed to be as fast as possible and not ask sincere earnest questions.

That's what you don't get about Neil Postman's work, high-speed electric media, #Bluesky

# Playing Race Card against Putin invasion

My response:

"We’re talking about the USA, which has been racist since before it was founded."

No, I am talking about #PsyOps against #MAGA from the very start of this thread, but you have #ContextBewilderment 

Your fixation on "orange skin color", black skin color, brown is missing the entire point. 

Context of post thread: “MAGA was the greatest PSYOP ever perpetrated on the American people.  And I fucking fell for it”

Anti-woman Hillary Clinton, anti-woman Kamala Harris,  anti woman sex rights, anti gender, anti homosexual is driving USA from #Christian #Muslim #Religion as much as any #race

My reply:

I notice you skip multi-message repels and only reply to the 1st every time, you have media blindness issues of seeing the reply threads are not just the first message.

1. Bothsidesism is what you’re doing

Explain, detai? Since you can't get past skin color GENDER of Hillary Kamala 

2. Are you also a victim?

Yes. of course. Billionaires #Putin #Trump #Musk are fucking over my life with bullshit messages on every media platform, #Bluesky too #GrokAI #TruthSocial

My reply (with that last screen shot to assert context harder):

Your low-effort reply to a professional published edited article on #TheAtlantic

# Pro-Putin Banality Agent

1. Context Bewilderment
2. Useful idiot for Russia?
3. Tool for corporate Truth Social / Twitter / Murdoch?
4. Gullible USA?

I already hash-tagged a reply with "Context Bewilderment" and noted they reply only to 1st message in multi-message replies. And keep deflecting away from { Russia, Putin, Gender / Transgender / Women / Abortion }.

# Freaking out of my Bluesky User Profile

On my Bluesky user profile I have "War and Peace", so now they are gong for that. Also playing the Hillary Clinton trigger of "You the Puppet" Trump response, turning tables that I'm the Russian since I called out Putin's IRA PSYOP on Bluesky.

Look at the great context, this is their reply after linking the December 20, 2013 article on The Atlantic about gender / women and not it being race / orange skin / black skin / white skin that is the basis of Putin's information war. See the image context of asserting The Atlantic article.
