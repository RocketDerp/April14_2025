"Psyops, lol, nope, these people are just gullible and selfish bigots." - Russia is laughing away at your "LOL, nope" denial of the Ukraine war and direct warfare on Twitter and Reddit and Facebook and YouTube and Bluesky and.... Denial USA. Russia won. #SurkovSaysA  #Psyops gloating in #Newsweek https://www.newsweek.com/russia-president-vladimir-putin-election-americans-1327793

* This is a reply to a Bluesky posting that made it to the front page top of Reddit in under 90 minutes. https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/1ppazqc/maga_was_the_greatest_psyop_ever_perpetrated_on/ - with little engagement on Bluesky itself.

"Whatevs bro. Bigots. And Morons"

An entire nation of people who welcome Russian information warfare into their home, feed it to their children since March 2013 without resisting in any way. #SinceMarch2013 

#OutGroupMoron MAGA calls you moron. Everyone a moron nation.

My response: "MAGA is based on feelings of self-victimhood, and the term Psyops implies that Trump voters are victims. They're not. "

Rupert Murdoch #FoxNews and Elon Musk #Twitter against a low-education rural MAGA culture. Study media ecology and face up to Blueksy. #NeilPostman

My response:

"We all have a responsibility to not be racists. It’s not always easy, but MAGA embraced it. They are not victims."

The problem is #Christmas 

You don't need to have a skin color or #racial difference to form hate-groups like Bluesky ( Hate MAGA) vs. Twitter (MAGA)

"1 John 4:20" Bible verse issue

I have lived in north Africa #ArabSpring2010 and Middle East to study this.

The #Islamic terrorists in #Algeria don't have a different skin color / race from those they { hate butcher murder deport }

Racial and skin color is superficial / shallow. "Orange Skin" fxiation.

1. Fox News fiction vs.

My response:

"I don’t even know what you’re talking about."

Yes, because social media is the very problem. High-speed reactionary, you are programmed to be as fast as possible and not ask sincere earnest questions.

That's what you don't get about Neil Postman's work, high-speed electric media, #Bluesky

# Playing Race Card against Putin invasion

My response:

"We’re talking about the USA, which has been racist since before it was founded."

No, I am talking about #PsyOps against #MAGA from the very start of this thread, but you have #ContextBewilderment 

Your fixation on "orange skin color", black skin color, brown is missing the entire point. 

Context of post thread: “MAGA was the greatest PSYOP ever perpetrated on the American people.  And I fucking fell for it”

Anti-woman Hillary Clinton, anti-woman Kamala Harris,  anti woman sex rights, anti gender, anti homosexual is driving USA from #Christian #Muslim #Religion as much as any #race
