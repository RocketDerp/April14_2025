Been watching this guy for like a year...

"If you're a regular commenter on this channel, you're fine. If you're a normal human being , you're fine. Disagreements are fine, not liking a book I cover is fine, even criticizing the video itself is fine. Not fine = "Wow this channel is sh*t and clearly you don't understand what you're talking about" = hateful mean post with no elaboration or meaningful critique."
