Anti-Malala answer. Anti-Joyce answer. I have been living under religion facism my entire life with Levant Jesus and Allah "Judgement Day"... and bullets don't kill science fiction storytelling of Bible and Torah.

Nobody seems to care about governing? Leadership? Just mind-fucking? Convincing people. Not reality, but mind exploiting, advertising?

Writing people off. There is an implied "winning" in Putin's war. That self-harm of humanity is winning. That if Russia wins against Ukraine that it is indeed a win. It isn't. It is badness. I think goodness is being written off in the way MLK Jr. describes. I think future of children is written off. There is an avoidance of rescuing, death for preching, death for ideals. Not with force and violence, but with ideas. I think the love people "settle for" is a low bar, a style, a fashion. I think love is a path, a direction. And anti-love anti-goodness is attracting people out of education and understanding crisis, or an over-focus on competititon and "winning" itself. We are writing off the metaphor of heaven (and I do not believe in The Bible except as science fiction storytelling. Heaven is an non-created place, not something constructed in the past by the metaphor of God, but a future construct).
