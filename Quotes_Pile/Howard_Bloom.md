# Howard Bloom quotes

When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans--fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists--can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways.

Their being fed Russian meme patterns. That's why I mentioned in the message you replied to Kremlin / Russia / mental manipulation.

On the other side of the religious divide stood the new Fundamentalists of Racial Purity and Christianity, whose leaders skillfully manipulated conformity enforcement mechanisms which impel us to pick on those who are different. Typical among these was a group called **Russian National Unity,** which claimed an army of 70,000, snapped up members at the age of nine, enrolled them in "military patriotic clubs," dressed them in fascist uniforms, **gave them the insignia of the swastika, taught them the Nazi salute,** drilled them in combat maneuvers, honed their marksmanship, and identified the target of their weapons in their anthem:

    we are going down the straight road
    to believe, desire, and dare
    death to the cosmopolitan dogs and Jews and masons!

National Unity's founder, karate coach Alexander Barkashov, quoted yet another tune when giving interviews on the dangers of world Jewry and of the United States:

    Plunge your knife in the vampire's throat  
    And the world will become good again.

Many parents welcomed National Unity's training for mass murder.

NOTE: I like to emphasize that this book was published before September 11, 2001 terrorism attacks on USA by Islamic / Saudi Arabians / Mecca fiction media empire followers. As it offers a great perspective of NYC research and thinking before 9/11 changed so many attitudes.

Public posting that Reddit owners say as "deleted" on "new reddit", that I did not delete.

The Howard Bloom quote which I hand-typed in from the printed book.    https://old.reddit.com/r/WhiteHouseHyperReal/comments/co5h7i/the_right_wing_is_trying_to_make_it_a_crime_to/ewgbpov/
Also I noted in public that the same comment / book quote from Howard Bloom was hidden by the site owners of Reddit in /r/Politics and could only be published in a low-traffic subreddit that I was moderator of.  Reddit constantly supresses book quotes and authors. As was documented in this example in August 2019 when Trumpw as in office the first time.
