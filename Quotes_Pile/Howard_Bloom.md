# Howard Bloom quotes

When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans--fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists--can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by [even] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways.

Public posting that Reddit owners say as "deleted" on "new reddit", that I did not delete.

"The Right Wing Is Trying to Make It a Crime to Oppose Fascism ( This is another MonoMyth media pattern: Blasphemy is forbidden against the Holy Authority and our Faith System )"

The Howard Bloom quote which I hand-typed in from the printed book.    https://old.reddit.com/r/WhiteHouseHyperReal/comments/co5h7i/the_right_wing_is_trying_to_make_it_a_crime_to/ewgbpov/
Also I noted in public that the same comment / book quote from Howard Bloom was hidden by the site owners of Reddit in /r/Politics and could only be published in a low-traffic subreddit that I was moderator of.  Reddit constantly supresses book quotes and authors. As was documented in this example in August 2019 when Trumpw as in office the first time.
