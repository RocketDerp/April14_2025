One-word answers, so trivial. "Cults". Yes, plura media cults: the media addicts who love Reality TV "The Apprentice" and the media addicts who hate Reality TV "The Apprentice", and 5,000 variations of meme cults deployed by the Russian Internet Research Agency since March 2013. One-word no-thinking reaction commment cults. People who spend all their free time and spare time on social machines declaring it is a cult without any engagement of nonfiction from the pullic library to teach cult deprogramming. Because the cults of cults, people in cults of mocking and insulting other cults, is the same media addiction problems centered around entertainer Reality TV superstar Donald Trump.

No authors named dropped, no book titles, no URL to more information. Just millions of comments day after day for over 10 years while not lifting a finger to get on the same page or rally around nonfiction education on the suject. Cults of commenting about the situation, entirely lacking in self-wareness of how Surkovian governing works on Reddit comment creators.

It's possible for Rupert Murdoch media network to compltely brainwash the out-group, but no self awareness of the Internet Resarch Agency workign for Putin to brainwash Reddit /r/All consumers. To seek out no-citation low-effort short comments that provide no author names, book names, by people who can create as many accounts as they want wth no identity or location information. With Fox News, you have real faces of real people creating messages, not afraid to death of being human when commenting on Reddit dehumanizing machines. Self-dehumanization platform of hide real life. Calls out the trees of the Fox News audience as brainwashed - but does not name-drop Jen Senko year 2015 film (before Trump win of election in November 2016). Jen Senko should be a household name as the "the little guy" Baby Boobmer who stood up to Fox News, but instead, you get people using spare time / free time on Reddit to say *only HDTV audiences are brainwashed*, not Internet meme addicts on Facebook / Bluesky / Reddit. Surkov Won, Russia won, since March 2013.

No author name drop, no book name drop, just describing that people are thrilled to watch Ameicans suffer. Just like Reddit content sells of watching Americans suffer day after day to Russian Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica pairing.

Twitter-length message, Tweet-think "It is that simple!" - Rick Roderick in 1993 describes this behavior. The Russian Internet Research Agency is waging the most sophisticated information war ever seen in the history of information war (NATO Breedlove declared in September 2014) and social media addicts swining in a mindfucked toxic nation can't muster any kind of defense or education on mind exploits of patterns of out-group hate.

Why would they want to shut down their meme addiction to constantly mocking and insulting Donald Trump that's been going on for over 10 years? Why would they desire to stop the Russian IRA mindsets that ar so amusing and engaging on Reddit?

Compuslive hate and compuslive dehumanization. Exactly as conditioned. Exactly what Russia wants. People so drawn to hate magnet, so draw to dehumanization values.

Yes. 10 years of react-commenting at Donald Trump. Total media addict nation, who can't get enugh of hate Trump / mock Trump media. Completley overrun by the Russian information warfare to induce self-harm hate.

They have a constant humor amusement attitude. People clealry can not study the media ecology of Fox News, it is constantly mocking and insulting humanism. The sense of humor is entertainment and fiction. Mocking out-groups and creating a total mockery so there is polarity around bullshit. People on Reddit truly need to study the 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" by Neil Postman. https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/03/27/us-politics-2024-predicted-media-expert-neil-postman/73022583007/

Comedian and entertainer Stephen Colbert has convinced Reddit meme consumers that more absurd surreal is the ideal way to solve the Russian Surkovian informaiton warfare. To keep dumping petrol / gasoline on the fires that the Russian use of Cambridge Analytia ceated. That the deepst faith is always add more fiction bullshit to a crisis of avoiding nonfiction. Nobody can even name the IRA oo Reddit, nobody can name Neil Postman or Rick Roderick, just constant falling into the anti-reality warfare that Putin started in March 2013.

He makes profit selling cult coonent to the cults who mock other cults. Fiction / humor / sureal comedy content. Fiction outsells nonfiction.

Only the out-group, Russia minf-cuked EVERYONE, all inclusive, Democrats too since Macrch 2013. Simulacra vs. simulacras. Denial abounds. Multiple NATO nations reporting, not just USA Dems vs. USA GOP.

Brainwashing via media systems. Why isn't Jen Senko's 2015 film a household name, why aren't the free time spare time people on Reddit promoting Jen Senko as a common cause to counter brainwashing? Where are the cult deprogramming nonfiction book teachings by Reddit users who react-comment to Trump every minute of every day for 10 years? Beause they are all in media cults of Hate Trump / Trump Mock values. Russia's win isn't just Republicans, it is everyone to abandon goodness in favor of hate and mockery, a nation of ***total mockery***, all inclusive mocking as faith. Avoidant of nonfictin on how Russia information warfware works and names of the methods.
