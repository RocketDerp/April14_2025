“Censorship, after all, is the tribute tyrants pay to the assumption that a public knows the difference between serious discourse and entertainment — and cares. How delighted would be all the kings, czars and führers of the past (and commissars of the present) to know that censorship is not a necessity when all political discourse takes the form of a jest.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: [Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Year 1985. Nonfiction.
