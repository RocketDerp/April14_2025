# Neil Postman 1985

"As I write, the President of the United States is a former Hollywood movie actor. One of his principal challengers in 1984 was once a featured player on television’s most glamorous show of the 1960’s, that is to say, an astronaut. Naturally, a movie has been made about his extraterrestrial adventure. Former nominee George McGovern has hosted the popular television show “Saturday Night Live.” So has a candidate of more recent vintage, the Reverend Jesse Jackson." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Chapter 1: The Medium is The Metaphor. Page 26 of 291 pages (modern edition with context intro).
