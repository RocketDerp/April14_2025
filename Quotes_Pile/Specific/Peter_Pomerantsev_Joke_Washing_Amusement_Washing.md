“This is a new type of Kremlin propaganda, less about arguing against the West with a counter-model as in the Cold War, more about slipping inside its language to play and taunt it from inside. In the ad for Larry King’s show, keywords associated with the journalist flash up on screen: ‘reputation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘respect’, more and more of them until they merge into a fuzz, finishing with the jokey ‘suspenders’ (i.e. braces). Then King, sitting in a studio, turns to the camera and says: ‘I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power instead of speaking on their behalf. That’s why you can find my new show, Larry King Now, right here on RT. Question more.”
― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing is True and Everything is Possible: Adventures in Modern Russia
