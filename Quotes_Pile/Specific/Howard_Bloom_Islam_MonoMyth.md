# Howard Bloom: Islam MonoMyth

Another book I’d **written and published before 9/11**, Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind From The Big Bang to the 21st Century, had focused on the way **subcultures battle to take over the mass mind of a society**. One chapter had zeroed in on a man only a handful of others had paid attention to, Osama bin Laden. A Pakistani Moslem reader called Global Brain the only book that tells it like it is about militant Islam. Yet, like other watchmen at the gates, I’d utterly failed to get my warnings across.

I did not want to fail again. So I set aside my work in the science of mass behavior and focused full-time on the puzzles of militant Islam.

Militant Islamic history is extremely hard to follow. The 4,000 pages I’d compiled on the topic were jumbled like jigsaw puzzle pieces. They refused to tell a coherent story. So when I was asked to give a speech I called Islam’s War to Save the West at the New York Military Affairs Symposium in 2004, I spent six months compiling a 159-page timeline of militant Islam from its beginning in the seventh century to the present, a timeline complete with a world map showing the reach of militant Islam’s colonialism and imperialism, a colonialism invisible to us because of its astonishing success as an indigenous culture-eraser and new-culture-shaper.
