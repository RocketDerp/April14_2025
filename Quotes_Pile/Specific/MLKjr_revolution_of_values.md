# MLK Jr. Revolution of values

A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies. This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe, race, class, and nation **is in reality** a call for an all-embracing, unconditional love **for all** men. This oft **misunderstood and misinterpreted concept**, so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force, has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of mankind. And when I speak of love I'm not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am speaking of that force which **all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle** of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to **ultimate reality**. This Hindu-Muslim-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about **ultimate reality** is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of John "Let us love one another, for God is love. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us."
