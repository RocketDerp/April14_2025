# We Are Not Good Enough

Goodness itself.

"The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough."    
"our moral genius lags"   
"We haven't learned how to be just and honest and kind and true and loving."

"The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world. The problem is with man himself and man's soul. We haven't learned how to be just and honest and kind and true and loving. And that is the basis of our problem."
- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
