The LSD thing is is fascinating in relation to this. It is intentionally achieved schizophrenia so to say with the hope and expectation for spontaneous remission which doesn't always occur. Yoga is also an intentional schizophrenia. One breaks off it turns inward and that the mystic process as well is very similar. Now what's the difference between the mystical and the psychotic experience. They plunge into the same water as there's no doubt about it the symbolism is just the same. And I want to speak about it in a little while but it is. The defense said. That the mystic. With the instruction of a master or because of his own native talents. Is able to swim in those waters. He does not drown in them.
