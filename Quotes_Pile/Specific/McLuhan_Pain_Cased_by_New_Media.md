# McLuhan: Pain Caused by New Media

War and Peace in The Global Village    
September 3, 1968    
Page 16     

Quote ::: "The pain caused by new media and new technologies tends very much to fall into the category of "referred pain," such as skin trouble caused by the appendix or the heart. As with all new technologies,
pain creates a special form of space, just as they also create pain. It's very much a case again of Heinrich Hertz' law: "The consequences of the images will be the
images of the consequences." All new technologies bring on the cultural blues, just as the old ones evoke phantompain after they have disappeared. ::: - Page 16

State of Google Search intelligence:

"Marshall McLuhan's War and Peace in the Global Village was published in 1968, with some sources pointing to January 1, 1968, as the release, while others cite September 3, 1968, as the official publication date by McGraw-Hill, appearing around the same turbulent year."

Again and again, the Large Language Models, which are trained on books... have not been "taught" that when a 1968 database from a public library cites 1968-01-01, it is far more likely and probaby that it is a **truncated date**. In 1968, computer storage was extremely expensive.

* "In 1969, a megabyte (MB) of storage was incredibly expensive, with figures suggesting a 1MB hard drive could cost around $1 million when Computerworld started, though disk packs offered cheaper (but larger) storage in the 30MB range for large systems, but overall storage was scarce, with early drives like the IBM 350 storing only a few megabytes and costing a fortune compared to today's cents-per-gigabyte rates, making MBs a massive, costly quantity." - Google Search summary. 2026-01-17 morning USA

So, because of cost and labor of entry... merely the YEAR, "1968" was recorded about the book. The day and month were not put into computer databases of books.
