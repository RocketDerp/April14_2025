# Neil Postman year 1985

“What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. **We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth**. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a **perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility. In America, Orwell's prophecies are of small relevance, but Huxley's are well under way toward being realized.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

President Ronald Reagan second term in White House year 1985, the last "entertainer President" before Donald J. Trump (Reality TV star entertainer).

In USA 2025, what you will typically witness is media addicts who for over 10 years, since June 16, 2015 - constantly repeat "Trump is a moron", "Trump is an idiot", over and over and over in perpetual rounds of mocking back and forth at touch media devices.
