Bandy Lee: Thank you very much for coming to our town hall-style forum by the title: “Does
Professional Responsibility Include a Duty to Warn?” My name is Bandy Lee, M.D. I am
Assistant Clinical Professor in Law and Psychiatry. I decided to do this because, as one famous
psychologist put it, “It is the elephant in the room,” and secondly because professional
organizations have made errors in the past, and without free and open discussion, we cannot
rigorously be an ethical check on ourselves.
