# Bandy X Lee: *Bully*

* “In Donald Trump, we have a frightening Venn diagram consisting of three circles: the first is extreme present hedonism; the second, narcissism; and the third, **bullying behavior.** These three circles overlap in the middle to create an impulsive, immature, incompetent person who, when in the position of ultimate power, easily slides into the role of tyrant, complete with family members sitting at his proverbial “ruling table.” Like a fledgling dictator, he plants psychological seeds of treachery in **sections of our population that reinforce already negative attitudes**.” ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. October 3, 2017.
