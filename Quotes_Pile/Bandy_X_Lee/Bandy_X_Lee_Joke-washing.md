# Dr. Bandy X Lee: *Joke-washing*

"When NPD and psychopathy combine, they form a pattern of behavior called malignant narcissism. This isn’t a diagnosis, but a term coined by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and elaborated on by personality disorder expert, Otto Kernberg, to describe people so driven by feeling special that they essentially see other people as **pawns in their game** of kill or be killed, whether metaphorically or literally. Hitler, who murdered millions, Kim Jong-un, who’s suspected of ordering his uncle’s and brother-in-law’s deaths, and **Vladimir Putin, who jokes about “liquidating journalists”** — no doubt all fall in the category of malignant narcissist (among possessing other pernicious traits, like sadism, or delight in hurting others)."
