"The **successful** sociopath’s predatory “empathy” reflects a definite perceptive acumen, making him a genius at manipulation. When this works, it produces a disastrous trust in him. Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality. The more a sociopath needs to scapegoat others the more he genuinely hates them, **making him even more aggressive and sadistic. Life is devoted to endless destruction in the service of an endless quest for power and admiration**, unmitigated by basic empathy or guilt." ― Bandy X Lee, [The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.
