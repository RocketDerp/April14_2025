My reply comment:  

"populace is united in thinking that whatever stripe the leader is going to be, they absolutely, absolutely, need to be a clown?"

Yes. This is my area of society focus for decades now. Neil Postman's nonfiction 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business" by Manhattan professor.. New York University. 

This 1985 book covers Fox News NYC 11 years before it went online in 1996. This book covers every thinking problem related to Donald Trump NYC. Time Magazine website covered the book as a topic last year for 40 year old 1985 to 2025.

The Population, We The People, are media clowns. “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Year 1985.
