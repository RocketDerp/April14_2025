"Brain Rot Society 47"   
**#BrainRotSociety47**   

I have been analyzing Reddit media since year 2009. Reddit is the most Usenet-like social media of current times that has widespread popularity with the technically trained community. Alas, since June of year 2015, Reddit community is a cult of commenting and remarking about events in a way that is avoidance of nonfiction stable sources of information.

Reddit community suffers from filter-bubble **#FilterBubble** mindsets what I call anti-FAQ anti-Wiki scattering of important topics into fragmented understandings... for the sake of people creating original comments that often reach the same conclusions. 

Reddit members believe they are resting Donald Trump and MAGA, in reality they are joke-washing, humor-washing, meme-washing Trump as a source of entertainment and amusement. Bluntly: Reddit is a top venue for Trump content cult. **#NeilPostman** is essential learning and context on this topic, 1985 book ["***Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death). Reddit is a hate-watching fandom that is attracted to Donald Trump as a "LOLCOW" to milk for jokes.

The USA society has normalized the crisis of Trump hate-watching. Trump fandoms are routine and normal. People who are following Trump's leadership in hate and mockery. Following hate. Following mockery.

"Brainrot Society 47" is my attempt to highlight the missing self-awareness. The need to organize a "top 25 topics" for everyone to know... to ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE as to what is important and significant common ground problems with billionaire-run society.

I created a GitHub project in my troubled attempts to articulate and organize understanding on the crisis:
