I told the A.I., in my prompt, to NOT give me the word in the song title.

Prompt: " song from 15 years or so ago, female singer, not a huge hit song. Talks about naming child "Nebraska" in lyrics. The Title of the song does not have "Nebraska" "

Also note.. ignoring my specific request to NOT give me a song with "Nebraska" in the title, since Google A.I. on previous search sessions seems to be shallow on the title vs. body / lyircs....

The Lucy Rose song was not released until year 2015. And the music videi March 15, 2016. Which does not fit with the "about 15 years" ago criteria of the query / promot to Google AI.

This was the start of a new session with the promot, a fresh browser. There were no previous promots in that question.

I just went to a fresh session with free ChatGPT and it got it instantly. Exact same prompt.

For the recrod: This was a legit query for me. I could not remember any other lyrics, I could not remember the name of the artist, I could not rember the name of the song. I listened to the song at least 25 times back in year 2012 or 2013 - I think Amazon music gave me a free copy. But songs I like I tend not to memorize or recall well. But I was readinb about a medical clinic closing today in Nebraska and I recalled part of the tune in my mind and this was the promot I came up with. I tried other Google A. I. sessions with other promots and it always keep fixating on the song-title having "Nebraska" in it instead of in the lyrics about naming a child / calling a child.
