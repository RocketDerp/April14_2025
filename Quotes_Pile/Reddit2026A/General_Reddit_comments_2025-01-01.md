A tiny-short Tweet-think message. No link, no author name, no book titles, no quotes. The most up-voted comment on the top of front page of Reddit.

What is avoided in this Reddit society is facing up to the pattern. The medical doctors who work for Trump are not all age 79 dementia and senile. They are age 45 men with medical degrees. And many of them. But Reddit society and Bluesky society fixate on just the President Tony Clifton performances from the leaders.

This is a "seeing the forest for the trees" problem. An inability to organize and see media systems like Fox News HDTV audience and others as thriving off falsehoods. Taking on in an organized sustained way, not one tree at a time, but teaching how people behave in groups. Mob mentality of entire audiences, Reddit audiences, Fox News HDTV audiences.

Trump is a master of crating conflicting paradox information. Surkov students. People get attracted to monomyth paradox story patterns and abandon science thinking in favor of mythology monomyth patterns.
