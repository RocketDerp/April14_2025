"I don't get why people **want to do mental gymnastics** to try and make up reasons when the simplest explanation is correct here."

Answer: Reddit is mind-fucking ground zero for the Internet Research Agency and modern names and mental manipulation since March 2013. Mind-fucked beyond all belief users who do mental gymnastics, typically with jokes, comedy, memes, funny-business (blocking threads, getting users banned), and humor, to deny reality itself. The want / desire to play screen games, "grinding" on video games, with Reddit commenting about how thrilling... interactive fiction... of Putin's Kremlin ARG.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - we should NOW be repeating it every 47 hours over and over, keep repeating, again and again!

It is not a "hidden agenda", the Reddit audience is not engaging with reality itself. Surkov monomyth won. Mythology storytelling is what Reddit favors, not real understanding or comprehension. The hate for humanism is not hidden or concealed. It is not hard to see the constant fandom of Trump images on Reddit, the addiction to celebrity worship of Trump is not hidden. The time pent joking and laughing at Trump on Reddit is what people desire to do with their time, their source of entertainment. Cult of Trump photographs, Reddit is center of it all. Addicts to fiction, always avoiding nonfiction. Such as:

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare.

Leftist vs. right, left vs. right, is a kind of brainrot thinking. it all starts to make much more sense how Afghanistan Taliban defeated USA after two decades if you study: **fiction vs. nonfiction**. Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan has a great book on education and Radio Mullah.

In the case of USA, it is more along these lines: children are raised to memorize Fox News HDTV programming and deny medical science learning and health care compassion for others.

No, we are no longer competing for understanding nonfiction books at the public library. Twitter-length commenting is the competition the USA society choose since year 2013. Competing for Reddit low-effort messages. Science learning was considered boring and tedious. Malala was the last great spiritual leader, and she didn't have a chance against Reddit memeland. Study the Malala vs. Trump timeline of year 2012: https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md ... Men vs. women. Dr. Bandy X Lee vs. Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan won. 

See also: https://old.reddit.com/r/ThoughtfulSocialMedia that I created August 12, 2021. But thoughtless commenting is what won social media. And Elon Musk saw it and purchased Twitter social media leadership in year 2022, shortly after I created that subreddit to try and describe the ongoing anti-Malala anti-women crisis. Joe Rogan won. Elon Musk won. Reddit meme-think men won. Reddit joke-washed Russia media invasion as a "nothing burger", Reddit audience comedy-washed Trump every day on Reddit since June 16, 2015. Neil Postman was correct in year 1985. Amused to Death.

Block-happy, deport-happy, self-deport intimidation. The bigger trouble is there is no morality education. Banning is the moral teacher, which teaches only the power of machines and power itself. No education or teaching of WHY. And hence, without morality learning, people on Reddit community do not turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 in the face of MAGA cult. People just chant word "cult" and do not see any moral need / civic duty, for *Adult education** with nonfiction serious books and peer to peer teaching.

Reddit is a Trump image fandom.Media fans of Trump as entertainment source. Mimicking Trump, adopting his words and techniques of communications. People follow the Trump image signals. Trump leads with hate and Reddit is a hate-prizing anti-Malala anti-MLKJr society. People quote Trump constantly but avoid any kind of messages about the need for more love, compassion, world peace. Those are all mocked like Trump mocks compassion and peace for out-groups.

If Reddit society cared about the future of USA (goodness), adult education of morality and goodness would be constant top topics. Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 is almost entirely ignored on Reddit. People far prefer saying little tiny-short messages of anti-education. Little 4-word "cult 45" jokes. Which is a cult of mocking. Trump leads thousands of different cults of mockery. Like 25,000 Trump subreddits and TV channels all of winch mock and insult. All Trump techniques, all the time.

The whole game of mocking is a corrupt sport. But all people car about is being on a specific team of mocking other teams of mockery. Surkov won. The technique won. Mocking and hate are prized all across the USA in year 2026. It was not this way before year 2013, hate wasn't prized and promoted everywhere. MLK Jr's hate education and understandings have been erased from concern by Putin's Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency since march 2013. Again: Surkov won. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4

FIFA world cup. Billionaires exploiting the poor people with media systems. We could all go down to the local park and watch children interact and get exercise, but everyone wants to sit in a seat and watch men earn millions of dollars per hour with an army of medical doctors - and we sell that to our children, FIFA branding video games and indoctrination at age 3. Religion of year 635 Mohammad's Quran isn't the newest religion... it's billionaire players. The grooming system of sexual icons for images / video / stadiums / seating.

Why don't we have the strongest and most able athletic men in the world fly city to city and build houses for the homeless and build hospitals and build schools. Do the kind of things the Malala foundation supports? https://Malala.org/leadership-council

Why can't we be happy that a person who has shit food can have a team of men fly in and help sort out the education, social, poverty problems? That would make me feel joy and goodness. Instead, we get men who play on a rectangle FIFA game. Don't give me the fucking bullshit that we can have both. We need to solve the poverty and hate problems NOW! Trump is the PROOF, Musk is the PROOF, "FIFA Peace Award #1 Trump" is the PROOF it needs to be YESTERDAY NOW!!!

He bloviated that he would “blow out of the water” the seven small Iranian boats whose sailors had harrassed and given the finger to our **“beautiful destroyers.” He bragged that “Russia and I would get along really well.”** He suggested that maybe “the Second Amendment people” might be able to stop Hillary; that his supporters should patrol voting sites to ensure he was being treated fairly, and that he would love to “hit and hit and hit \[his critics from the DNC\] until their heads spin and they’ll never recover.”     
He insisted that he will “bomb the shit out of ISIS” and order our soldiers to kill their presumed families. He repeatedly goaded supporters to rough up hecklers at his speeches and pontificated that NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem should find another country. He quoted Mussolini’s “Better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep,” and he expressed genuine bewilderment about why we build nuclear weapons if we don’t use them.

Putin has been killing people in Ukraine since February 2014. Putin is leading the entire USA into hate. People hate Trump, people hate harder and harder. The most serious people on Reddit promotes the message *hate harder* over and over to Putin's leadership. Putin leads with hate. Trump follows, and everyone follows Putin and Trump's hate leadership. Hate is the value everyone in USA shares. United States of Hate common ground. Since March 2013. Putin won. Surkov won.

The entire goal of Ukraine war was to make NATO hate USA, USA to hate humanism. USA to abandon all goodness education and teaching from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Hate vs. Hate, hate for hate. Surkov designed the information war off the Middle East conflicts. Syria war study, the Arab Spring. I was in Amman, Jordan in March 2011 studying the hate patterns for years. Hate motivates.

To study the attraction people had to each other and to toxic Internet content over goodness.

CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. **They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

Plenty more Surkov student screenplays to come. At least someone notices that they aren't incompetent and lazy and doing nothing. The active measures to self-harm the USA and create chaos is labor-intensive.

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

"slowly realizing"

I've been in social media professionally since 1985, I've never seen people so engaged as they are when Trump content appears on Bluesky and Reddit. Mocking away, insulting, name-calling, following the hate leadership. MLK Jr's teachings about hate have been entirely erased by Russia's Internet Research Agency. People are entirely avoidant of asserting equality of humans (USA Deceleration of independence ideals). The cheering on of "Leopards At My Face" movement is a pro-suffering pro-hate pro-terrorist media cult. People do not want to turn to nonfiction from Dr. Bandy X Lee to focus on mental health and learn from mistakes an get on better mindsets. Instead, people follow Trump's leadership of mockery and hate. Trump leads with hate, the tech loving communities follow.

"Putin"; Asking question of why. ANSWER: Because Americans are commenting on Reddit instead of using Reddit to assert Dr. Bandy X Lee. Instead of linking off-Reddit information about what Russia does, people are commenting over an over on Reddit as "engagement" to high speed messaging that generates money and power for the wealthy. We are drowning in shit-commenting on meme centers, Reddit meme land. It has been going on nonstop for a decade and is now self-evident to be abandonment of nonfiction learning. Surkov won since March 2013.

Real names of "The Little Guy" are suppressed on Reddit culture. Mostly childhood famous people like Elon Musk or Harrison Ford or Donald Trump get their real name on front page of Reddit. Unless you died in a famous way like being shot by ICE in the streets on video or murdered people with guns like Luigi. But, over all, Reddit users practice daily to hide their real life real world real identity when commenting and sharing information. Avoidant of nonfiction book authors. Amusement and jokes are prized above reality itself.

"Sex sells", rich people parade sex and role-model for parenting. So many in USA since June 16, 2015 have put their children in front of Newsmax HDTV and made Donald J. Trump a role model for parenting and nuclear family. So many everyday parents have made Trump the behavior model of social media messaging and leadership of business. Masculine dominating.

Study how much more Trump / Epstein / Musk sex life gets attention on Reddit fandoms of media than promoting grass-roots bottom-up "Stand Up for the Little Guy" (Girl) of Malala. Study the year 2012 timeline of Moscow Trump leadership vs. Malala's focus on billions of young girls: https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md

Alas, the popular culture, "pop", "pop cult" of Reddit front page of the Internet, will not assert Malala as a leader to follow since year 2013 when her book was published October 8, 2013.

ANSWER: Follow the leadership of Malala, go back to her year 2013 speeches and books and start sharing and quoting Malala.

Out-group mocking and out-group hate are foundations of Levant clergy leadership and popularity. 

Democracy does not work without "love thy neighbor", "love thy enemy". Published year 1988:

CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. **They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what the **Great Seal** is all about.

Hence why I constantly emphasize the social media comment creators avoidance of giving girls and women voice, promoting Malala as fundamental education and teaching change.

the "flex" is twitter-think. Shallow superficial commenting. Epstein topic fandom. People who are not serious about turning the topic to young girls and Malala's reformations... but just want to promote simple-thinking ideas and avoidance of Malala's nonfiction education, teaching, learning, comprehension, understanding focus. Twitter-thinking is about avoidance of deeper understanding and attraction to high-speed "rush" of notification delivery.

People see their friends at work get charmed by Donald Trump. And people still do not get that being charming is hat most people consider important. You can be terrible and evil but if you are charming like Trump, nothing can stop you year after year. Reddit social community is so charmed by Epstein and Trump.

Not taking on Rupert Murdoch's factory of charming methods and charming techniques with Neil Postman's books is how Putin defeated NATO and USA.

Dimwitted populace is afraid to create messages past TLDR. The dim lighting of the content people consume is more the concern. The dim meme thinking. Because the rapid delivery of the notification is more important to people than anything. Having to re-read the message 3 day later to better understand and ponder it rarely matters to people. Just the rush of the highway speed.

This GitHub project is to draw circles around all the avoided: Dr. Bandy X Lee. Jen Senko. that's enough for me. Why are a Baby Boomer woman and a Gen X woman not "good enough" as leaders? Both are out there enough. Malala is out there. But the charm older men hold over people is unbreakable when it comes to thinking. Allah in the sky is unbreakable thinking pattern. Jesus male in the sky on judgement day is unbreakable programming. Yahweh in the sky. The "Mary Sue" avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee and Jen Senko and Malala Y.

It never ever could have been more obvious than Putin and trump's relationship. Putin fucking kidnaps children from Ukraine.

Nobody on Reddit can make an association with organized religion.

The fucking BABY DADDY of Jesus! Fucking Christmas, who is the daddy? Gullible fandom of Santa does not ask exactly how a magical outer-pace Eden daddy gets to be the father of Jesus. "The Illuminate Child". It is as if nobody on Reddit can imagine the LITERAL LITERACY meaning of Bible verse John 1:1 

Putin has used John 1:1 meme patterns to mind-fuck the USA into trusting Donald Trump. Donald Trump trusts Putin as his "buddy". Go ask the Russian people what kind of Buddy Putin is. Go ask Ukraine what kind of loving neighbor Putin is.

Go ask about the young girls in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan.  Those are the places I have personally researched. 

Fuck, girls would brag about their older boyfriends in college when I was in high school! If a girl was sexy and pretty in high school, puberty raging and everyone wanting to not be a virgin at age 17... do people not get the pressure on attractive girls? My high school was competitive a fuck.

Again, who is the baby daddy of Jesus? The ultimate pregnancy from another school. My lover is king of kings, Heaven above, Eden daddy for Jesus.

OPERA_A The girls don't seem to care what's on... As long as they play 'til dawn. Nothin' but blues and Elvis... And somebody else's favorite song. "FM (No Static at All)" by Steely Dan was written and recorded in 1977 and released on May 19, 1978. Donald Trump is a gifted charmer and knows how to put his charming media moves over the medium. This song came out when I was 10 years old. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtFEJOL8kWU 16,630 views December 19, 2023
