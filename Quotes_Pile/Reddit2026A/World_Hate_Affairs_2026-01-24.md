"I don't get why people **want to do mental gymnastics** to try and make up reasons when the simplest explanation is correct here."

Answer: Reddit is mind-fucking ground zero for the Internet Research Agency and modern names and mental manipulation since March 2013. Mind-fucked beyond all belief users who do mental gymnastics, typically with jokes, comedy, memes, funny-business (blocking threads, getting users banned), and humor, to deny reality itself. The want / desire to play screen games, "grinding" on video games, with Reddit commenting about how thrilling... interactive fiction... of Putin's Kremlin ARG.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - we should NOW be repeating it every 47 hours over and over, keep repeating, again and again!

Surkov won. We are now in runaway Surkov monomty. But even wore, Russia is no longer in control of the mythology fiction deployed back in March 2013... Large Language Models since Q4 2022 have put USA into a machine-human feedback loop of monomyth variations. Self-harm out-group hate pattern.

"one man", brought USA down. Messaging on Reddit fandom of Trump: Ignore Rupert Murdoch media addiction. Ignore the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency invasion of Reddit community since March 2013 and the complete avoidance of an "Internet Uprising".

4-word tiny-short Tweet-think comment. "Russia", "Putin". Anything to avoid off-Reddit nonfiction learning for meme addictions.

It is not a "hidden agenda", the Reddit audience is not engaging with reality itself. Surkov monomyth won. Mythology storytelling is what Reddit favors, not real understanding or comprehension. The hate for humanism is not hidden or concealed. It is not hard to see the constant fandom of Trump images on Reddit, the addiction to celebrity worship of Trump is not hidden. The time pent joking and laughing at Trump on Reddit is what people desire to do with their time, their source of entertainment. Cult of Trump photographs, Reddit is center of it all. Addicts to fiction, always avoiding nonfiction. Such as:

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare.

Leftist vs. right, left vs. right, is a kind of brainrot thinking. it all starts to make much more sense how Afghanistan Taliban defeated USA after two decades if you study: **fiction vs. nonfiction**. Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan has a great book on education and Radio Mullah.

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013

In the case of USA, it is more along these lines: children are raised to memorize Fox News HDTV programming and deny medical science learning and health care compassion for others.

No, we are no longer competing for understanding nonfiction books at the public library. Twitter-length commenting is the competition the USA society choose since year 2013. Competing for Reddit low-effort messages. Science learning was considered boring and tedious. Malala was the last great spiritual leader, and she didn't have a chance against Reddit memeland. Study the Malala vs. Trump timeline of year 2012: https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md ... Men vs. women. Dr. Bandy X Lee vs. Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan won. 

See also: https://old.reddit.com/r/ThoughtfulSocialMedia that I created August 12, 2021. But thoughtless commenting is what won social media. And Elon Musk saw it and purchased Twitter social media leadership in year 2022, shortly after I created that subreddit to try and describe the ongoing anti-Malala anti-women crisis. Joe Rogan won. Elon Musk won. Reddit meme-think men won. Reddit joke-washed Russia media invasion as a "nothing burger", Reddit audience comedy-washed Trump every day on Reddit since June 16, 2015. Neil Postman was correct in year 1985. Amused to Death.

Secret police who burn books, disappear messages.

Disappear messages. Burn magazines and books.

Left-right brainrot. Fiction vs nonfiction is the important measure.

Block-happy, deport-happy, self-deport intimidation. The bigger trouble is there is no morality education. Banning is the moral teacher, which teaches only the power of machines and power itself. No education or teaching of WHY. And hence, without morality learning, people on Reddit community do not turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 in the face of MAGA cult. People just chant word "cult" and do not see any moral need / civic duty, for *Adult education** with nonfiction serious books and peer to peer teaching.

Reddit is a Trump image fandom.Media fans of Trump as entertainment source. Mimicking Trump, adopting his words and techniques of communications. People follow the Trump image signals. Trump leads with hate and Reddit is a hate-prizing anti-Malala anti-MLKJr society. People quote Trump constantly but avoid any kind of messages about the need for more love, compassion, world peace. Those are all mocked like Trump mocks compassion and peace for out-groups.

If Reddit society cared about the future of USA (goodness), adult education of morality and goodness would be constant top topics. Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 is almost entirely ignored on Reddit. People far prefer saying little tiny-short messages of anti-education. Little 4-word "cult 45" jokes. Which is a cult of mocking. Trump leads thousands of different cults of mockery. Like 25,000 Trump subreddits and TV channels all of winch mock and insult. All Trump techniques, all the time.

The whole game of mocking is a corrupt sport. But all people car about is being on a specific team of mocking other teams of mockery. Surkov won. The technique won. Mocking and hate are prized all across the USA in year 2026. It was not this way before year 2013, hate wasn't prized and promoted everywhere. MLK Jr's hate education and understandings have been erased from concern by Putin's Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency since march 2013. Again: Surkov won. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au332OG-M4
