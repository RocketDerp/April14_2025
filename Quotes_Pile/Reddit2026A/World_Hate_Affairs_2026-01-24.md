Note the reply message, "LMAO" short-message on "Russia" topic, comedy content for Reddit fandom of Putin and Trump.

"I don't get why people **want to do mental gymnastics** to try and make up reasons when the simplest explanation is correct here."

Answer: Reddit is mind-fucking ground zero for the Internet Research Agency and modern names and mental manipulation since March 2013. Mind-fucked beyond all belief users who do mental gymnastics, typically with jokes, comedy, memes, funny-business (blocking threads, getting users banned), and humor, to deny reality itself. The want / desire to play screen games, "grinding" on video games, with Reddit commenting about how thrilling... interactive fiction... of Putin's Kremlin ARG.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - we should NOW be repeating it every 47 hours over and over, keep repeating, again and again!

Surkov won. We are now in runaway Surkov monomty. But even wore, Russia is no longer in control of the mythology fiction deployed back in March 2013... Large Language Models since Q4 2022 have put USA into a machine-human feedback loop of monomyth variations. Self-harm out-group hate pattern.

"one man", brought USA down. Messaging on Reddit fandom of Trump: Ignore Rupert Murdoch media addiction. Ignore the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency invasion of Reddit community since March 2013 and the complete avoidance of an "Internet Uprising".

4-word tiny-short Tweet-think comment. "Russia", "Putin". Anything to avoid off-Reddit nonfiction learning for meme addictions.

It is not a "hidden agenda", the Reddit audience is not engaging with reality itself. Surkov monomyth won. Mythology storytelling is what Reddit favors, not real understanding or comprehension. The hate for humanism is not hidden or concealed. It is not hard to see the constant fandom of Trump images on Reddit, the addiction to celebrity worship of Trump is not hidden. The time pent joking and laughing at Trump on Reddit is what people desire to do with their time, their source of entertainment. Cult of Trump photographs, Reddit is center of it all. Addicts to fiction, always avoiding nonfiction. Such as:

Leftist vs. right, left vs. right, is a kind of brainrot thinking. it all starts to make much more sense how Afghanistan Taliban defeated USA after two decades if you study: **fiction vs. nonfiction**. Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan has a great book on education and Radio Mullah.

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013

In the case of USA, it is more along these lines: children are raised to memorize Fox News HDTV programming and deny medical science learning and health care compassion for others.
