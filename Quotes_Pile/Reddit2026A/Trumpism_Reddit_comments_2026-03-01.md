10 month Reddit account. Most popular upvoted comment. REDDIT_TOP_COMMENT_YOUNG_ACCOUNT As for the comment itself... The RECENCY_BIAS crisis of people having forgotten what USA life was like before year 2007 with the Apple iPhone. They can watch TV or film from year 2004 without smartphones, but there isn't any sense of recognition like when people see old footage of people riding horse and buggy without automobiles around. The behavior change with the Apple iPad and Apple iPhone since year 2007 has been much more dramatic. Rural "red state areas" less-educated Americans using computers and the Internet every single day drastically altered society behavior in the United States.

The endless mocking of 4D chess is because people will not face up to very important timelines and facts.  Trump made this video Sunday, right after he took a private jet to Moscow Russia on Friday. This was his big training acting big lesson November 8, 2013 weekend! **We The People** are not facing up that Trump is an actor who is acting, POTUS Tony Clifton character, with Surkov student screenplays. The Moscow Russia trip November 8, 2013 was to be on stage and get a performance - Friday, Saturday, Sunday - and then he posted his Twitter message Sunday night. 

These jokes do not write themselves, there is so much ignorance about the timeline and labor that goes into these antics politics and Reality TV scripting! Tony Clifton is SNL origins, Andy Kaufman, Trump's home media training / television learning ground NYC! Fox News HDTV is in NYC! But Reddit media addicts are blind to Manhattan's Neil Postman lessons about electric media systems.

* "Now, what is a myth? The dictionary definition of a myth would be stories about gods. So then you have to ask the next question: What is a god? A god is a personification of a motivating power or a value system that functions in human life and in the universe—the powers of your own body and of nature. The myths are metaphorical of spiritual potentiality in the human being, and the same powers that animate our life animate the life of the world. But also there are myths and gods that have to do with specific societies or the patron deities of the society. In other words, there are two totally different orders of mythology. There is the mythology that relates you to your nature and to the natural world, of which you’re a part. And there is the mythology that is strictly sociological, linking you to a particular society. You are not simply a natural man, you are a member of a particular group. In the history of European mythology, you can see the interaction of these two systems. Usually the socially oriented system is of a nomadic people who are moving around, so you learn that’s where your center is, in that group. The nature-oriented mythology would be of an earth-cultivating people. Now, **the biblical tradition is a socially oriented mythology**. Nature is condemned. In the nineteenth century, scholars thought of mythology and ritual as an attempt to control nature. But that is magic, not mythology or religion. Nature religions are not attempts to control nature but to help you put yourself in accord with it. But when nature is thought of as evil, you don’t put yourself in accord with it, you control it, or try to, and **hence the tension, the anxiety, the cutting down of forests, the annihilation of native people. And the accent here separates us from nature**." - Power of Myth, nonfiction. Published year 1988. George Lucas Skywalker Ranch California lessons for Star Wars fandoms.
