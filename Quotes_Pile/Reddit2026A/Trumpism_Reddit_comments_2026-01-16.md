Top voted comment on Reddit. Regardless of intention of the author, this message stands *for Trump*. This is the media addiction **of Joe Rogan fandom vs. Trump fandom. Fiction vs. fiction.** Monomyth vs. monmyth. Like two radio stations playing mostly the same songs but different disc jockey and advertising sponsorship inserts. And those who *hate Trump* have all the language (English) skills and ability to wage intellectual war AGAINST Putin and Trump. But they are so compulsively programmed by the IRA to defend and admire Trump's power.

I could have Pink Floyd write a song mocking Trump, people would purchase the song, learn the lyrics, and still support Trump! Because the thrill of mocking and insulting Trump is the dominate media addiction at play. People would *miss the point* of the song, even if they enjoyed it and sang the lyrics correctly.

MAGA believes in hate. Mocking and hate. And the more people show faith in hate and mocking, you are standing on the real estate land that Trump owns. The missing ingredient to the USA that Trump provided MAGA was: hate an mocking. And MAGA had first conquest rights, the hate flags were planted in anti Barack Obama. Look at Trump's year 2012 Tweet / Twitter record. But since January 1, 2024 EVERYONE, and I fucking mean EVERYONE, has only been teaching one lesson here: *hate harder*. Feedback looping of : hate, mocking.

Of course this *missing ingredients* to the melting pot of USA: { hate and mocking } are not new to humanity. Study the fucking Middle East clergy. Study Ireland. The { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon } clergy have all tried *hate harder* to their flock, the congregations! We have not intellectually faced up to September 11, 2001 lessons! Hate works, to create more hate!

The final sentence of the Reddit comment is great. If I could INSERT two paragraphs and one link into the public Reddit page (hack the output of Reddit). It would likely be:

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

DEAR REDDIT COMMUNITY: Please help. If there were a dirty dozen reflections of articles we the people could go back in time time (time travel) to all take more seriously and all memorize and quote to others... THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM! Help!

Yes. And we need to reform { Fox News HDTV media audience, Facebook media audience, Twitter Musk media audience, Newsmax HDTV media audience, Sinclair Media audience, Joe Rogan media audience, Truth Social media audience, Russia Today media audience, Church Bible media audience, Breaking Bad media audience }. Teaching Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman to ALL audiences is a huge part of We The People being rescued from Trumpism mindsets.

Top voted-comment on posting of Reddit front page. Snark, sarcasm, satire. War with NATO given the Elon Musk Tweet-length billionaire Musk twitter-thinking treatment. A short message that prizes Truth Social and Twitter style of "engagement questions" that are so popular. 

The same Reddit audience will claim that reporters and journalists don't ask "hard questions" or assert important topics when also making money engaging the very same audience (We The People, the citizens). There is no public cry for change in direction. No call for honest and sincere leadership. If anything, given how long Trump has lead the nation with snark and mockery, this message is **cal for* more of the same. TEN YEARS AN SEVEN MONTHS, 3,868 days fucking days of social media users treating USA government as the most entertaining jokes and media addiction.

Putin and Trump create { absurd comedy situations, surreal comedy, contradictory Vaudeville, wild and crazy antics, self-harm promises and actions to USA, a joke of USA } and social media audiences are ready at any time to amplify and add to the tone of mocking / mockery / anti-serious / anti-learning / anti-teaching. AND, blame "The Media" for not standing up to Trump -when it is indeed ***We The People** who prize trash commenting "just asking questions" engagement mind-exploitation. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgressiveHQ/comments/1qf240e/sources_confirm_the_us_house_and_senate_now_have/o01sq7y/

3 month Reddit account. Incredibly popular comment. Mocking, question. Reddit is the place where serious people think an ocean of shit commenting is good if they can find 2 or 3 edible corn kernels in the turd pile. The bar of "resisting" on social media is to be snark, which is exactly what MAGA runs the nation with. An attitude that MAGA is in on a secret joke an the out-groups (non-MAGA) don't "get the joke" of how rewarding it is to be stupid, dumb, and hate-filled.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1qf53t3/doctor_claims_trump_79_suffered_serious_medical/o02k0a2/

Yes. The audience of Trump, the fandom of Trump, is all complicity and enabling. Instead of halting all the bullshit social media snark and asserting Dr. Bandy X Lee since October 3, 2017 publication of her book. It is not difficult or time consuming to repeat quotes from a nonfiction book. But people are so addicted to the constant simulation of antics from Trump that they are not only avoiding seriously standing up to take on the media addiction problems of the Fox News HDTV audience... but outright addicted to the billionaire media machines delivering the *breaking news* of every Trump public antic.

Trump is a media addict leading a nation of high-speed information addicts. Engagement, influencer, influencing a population that prizes notification and commenting. Hate messaging Trump is the Reddit audience engagement. The addiction to Trump being on camera and quoted in the media is a bi-directional relationship.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1qf53t3/doctor_claims_trump_79_suffered_serious_medical/o02avf2/

Fandom discusses this all in a casual style. This is a documented PUBLIC figure. This isn't your buddy woo works at the grocery store or gas station. This is a man at the center of attention of thousands of books. But on Reddit, the tone is casual and Twitter-like now. No link to any book, no author name, no call to organize and remove Trump. It is as if sports fans are talking about a injury of one of their entertaining sports stars and how it might impact next moth's playoffs. If anything, sports fandoms can be MORE SERIOUS about citing sources and serious analysis than We The People are about world affairs lead by Trump's White House.

These tiny-short messages on Reddit are incredibly popular. They serve to show that the audience is treating this like a mobster film, like ["The Godfather" year 1972 American gangster fiction storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather). This is what a society of Reality TV addictions prizes as entertainment and audience conversation. Complete detachment from learning nonfiction about Russia's military information warfare against Reddit end-users. Such as: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 story. Avoided in favor of audience peer to peer hyper-banality messaging.

A population of touch-device addicts who can't resist following the Trump leadership, cult of Trump content and language. Media cult.

Elon Musk Twitter fandom (on Reddit) with the Tweet-thinking short-message *trivialization responses* to complex international affairs. Anti-Malala messaging on Reddit, anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-women learning messaging. That children indoctrinated into { Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Book of Mormon, cults, Scientology of L Ron Hubbard } can never ever be reversed. That children convinced Santa is real for Christmas can't ever be taught reason thinking and more sophisticated comprehension. Binary logic mindset. Messaging to the Reddit audience: do not confront Fox News HDTV, do not let women like Jen Senko https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad even think about standing up to Rupert Murdoch and junk billionaire Musk messaging.

This is what the fandom of Trump wants: people to prize low-effort lazy commenting on Reddit that promotes *give up* on education, teaching, FAQ, Wiki systems to organize and teach. Encouraging maximum banality of Tweet-thinking, following Musk media leadership.

It is sickening, I am incredibly sick that people will not assert { MLK Jr, Malala, Carl Sagan, Education for Adults, Teaching, Neil Postman } and stop this. Fox News was a subset of society in year 2012, but Putin's Internet Research Agency made every social media addict behave even WORSE than Fox News since year 2013. People will not turn to nonfiction serious books by Dr. Bandy X Lee and SERIOUSLY discuss Trump **cult mental health problems** of the MAGA nation.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

The deepest most cherished faith is SNL "Weekend Update" comedy, and Stephen Colbert and comedians making all problems disappear with jokes and memes on television.

Surkov students, Kremlin techniques, since March 2013 exploit this bottomless faith that USA population holds. That jokes and humor are ALWAYS the answer. The PERMANENT FAITH, the BLIND FAITH SYSTEM, that USA audiences hold. Laughter is the best Kremlin mind-fuck.

And no White House has EVER had so much media audience. Audience participation, right on Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter, etc. The entire world media systems prize every fiction story out of the White House. We are dealing with a World Wide Web of media addiction to *fiction* crisis. People are in no way self-aware of heir compulsive behavior to avoid nonfiction since the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica mind-fucked everyone starting in late year 2012. ["Operation Matthew 4:19 trolling" of audiences by Kremlin](/Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md). The University of Toronto teachings by Marshall McLuhan are NO LONGER OPTIONAL!!! Putin has mind-fucked everyone!

What's gong on here is a fake image. A cult of Trump facial and body images on Reddit. Fright to the top of the front page very quickly. Sexual fake images of Trump. The "Q" PizzaGate sex content audiences, Epstein sex fandom of Trump and other leaders. Entertainment culture USA, Reddit audience. Celebrity TV famous icons doing sex acts on camera, no matter how old.

I can't keep up with other social media platforms, but Reddit has turned into a all the time image fandom of Donald Trump. People are WAITING on Reddit for the next Donald Trump image or quote to appear. [Turd-testing society of Trump image fandoms](/Grim_Blunt/Society_of_grading_and_ranking_turds.md). A product of relentlessness team of media billionaire marketing and media systems feeding the USA consumers the cult images of Trump.

Yes, accidental mistake. At least SOMEONE is not gullible that Trump-worship images on a Sunday Church day are not "mistakes" to share with the public. Surkovian media techniques.

Daddy issues. Either love daddy, or hate daddy. Both groups line up to praise or mock daddy figures.  But whatever they do, they don't want to organize an FAQ or Wiki of top issues to stick to. Just chase around daddy father sex domination topic, "Epstein", while making no effort to organize around leaders like Dr. Bandy X Lee on mental health and what people are attracted to. 

Personally, I suggest people focus less on penis ('dong') size of leaders and more on the money spent on advertising, marketing, photographs, live video, media coverage. Media cult self-awareness. Prizing Trump as a source of stimulating media entertainment.

Trump fandom on Reddit thinks dehumanizing people with media systems, dehumanizing like Fox News media does, is a good thing. People need to face the media addiction to comedy antics is the very mechanism of power. Manhattan Professor Neil Postman's work applies to SNL meme-washing Trump. Trump is first and foremost an entertainer and popular as a celebrity. Facing up that his talent is personality and drawing attention is essential self-awareness of what we are dealing with as an education crisis in society. Trump is unstoppable because he turns minds into charmed attraction.

One man with Trump's problems isn't the concern nearly as much as an entire population that can't get behind Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership. We are all just one celebrity away from even worse outcomes in the world if we can't come to terms with the attraction people have to the dangerous self-harm like Putin and Trump.

Trump's fandom as a performance art, playing President Tony Clifton SNL acting, is incredibly high. Bluesky and Reddit fandom and YouTube fandom is THRILLED to have Trump to mock at. The audience mocking Tony Clifton shows is the primary comedy technique. People adore and love it, the fandom of hate on MLK Jr day 2026 has never been more strong! People find Trump's show irresistible. Entertainment and amusement at total mockery exceeds all else to Trump fandom.

I've been a social media user since Christmas 1982, age 13, and my media ecology thesis is that this is Trump fandom! Jesus monomyth is Surkovian monomyth by the IRA into Reddit hive mind / mass man (University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan terminology). Compusive addiction FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MOTHS to high-speed media *rush* of mocking DJT / POTUS / Manhattan NYC symbolism. Surkov students won! This (Reddit comment cited) is on of the many deep fans of Donald Trump in one of the many many many fandom venues!

The comment ending on a "/s" satire indicator / sarcasm indicator / shit-posting indicator does in no way dismiss the perspective Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman would highlight. The TIME SPENT, the FREE TIME, the SPARE TIME crating original absurd surreal comedy about Trump. The addiction to medium. For me, personally, this is Hell and it has worsened every single day and night since Bloomsday 2015.

Fandoms hang on Trump's every single word. The symbolism just pours into audience minds. The diplomatic delivery systems, leader to leader, symbolism of the FIFA Peace Prize planted around the Nobel. This type of response is everything "Woke" about James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Being incredibly superficial and banal and in no way recognizing that the *distinctive style* of Trump is *the medium* that overrides the message. The patterns of language reprogram meme-thinking in the Reddit audience! It is MASS MAN messaging. Because people flock to it, are so driven by Trump's markings and arrangement of language.

The formal business letter is the *medium* that blows Reddit audience minds. "Introibo ad altare Dei"

That’s very old fashioned, we all have lived with advertising for years."- Texan Rick Roderick, Duke https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

* "Political theorists, over the years, have looked for metaphors to describe the effects that Fox—particularly its widely watched opinion shows—has had on American politics and culture. They’ve talked about the network as an “information silo” and “a filter bubble” and an “echo chamber,” as an “alternate reality” constructed of “alternative facts,” as a virus on the body politic, as an organ of the state. The comparisons are all correct. But they **don’t quite capture** what the elegies for Fox-felled loved ones express so efficiently. Fox, for many of its fans, is an identity shaped by an ever-expanding **lexicon**: mob, PC police, Russiagate, deep state, MSM, MS-13, socialist agenda, Dems, libs, Benghazi, hordes, hoax, dirty, violent, invasion, open borders, anarchy, liberty, Donald Trump. Fox has two pronouns, you and they, and one tone: indignation. (You are under attack; they are the attackers.) Its **grammar** is grievance. Its effect is totalizing." ...
