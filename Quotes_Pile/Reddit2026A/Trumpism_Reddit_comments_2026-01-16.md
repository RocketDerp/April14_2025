Top voted comment on Reddit. Regardless of intention of the author, this message stands *for Trump*. This is the media addiction **of Joe Rogan fandom vs. Trump fandom. Fiction vs. fiction.** Monomyth vs. monmyth. Like two radio stations playing mostly the same songs but different disc jockey and advertising sponsorship inserts. And those who *hate Trump* have all the language (English) skills and ability to wage intellectual war AGAINST Putin and Trump. But they are so compulsively programmed by the IRA to defend and admire Trump's power.

I could have Pink Floyd write a song mocking Trump, people would purchase the song, learn the lyrics, and still support Trump! Because the thrill of mocking and insulting Trump is the dominate media addiction at play. People would *miss the point* of the song, even if they enjoyed it and sang the lyrics correctly.

MAGA believes in hate. Mocking and hate. And the more people show faith in hate and mocking, you are standing on the real estate land that Trump owns. The missing ingredient to the USA that Trump provided MAGA was: hate an mocking. And MAGA had first conquest rights, the hate flags were planted in anti Barack Obama. Look at Trump's year 2012 Tweet / Twitter record. But since January 1, 2024 EVERYONE, and I fucking mean EVERYONE, has only been teaching one lesson here: *hate harder*. Feedback looping of : hate, mocking.

Of course this *missing ingredients* to the melting pot of USA: { hate and mocking } are not new to humanity. Study the fucking Middle East clergy. Study Ireland. The { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon } clergy have all tried *hate harder* to their flock, the congregations! We have not intellectually faced up to September 11, 2001 lessons! Hate works, to create more hate!

The final sentence of the Reddit comment is great. If I could INSERT two paragraphs and one link into the public Reddit page (hack the output of Reddit). It would likely be:

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

DEAR REDDIT COMMUNITY: Please help. If there were a dirty dozen reflections of articles we the people could go back in time time (time travel) to all take more seriously and all memorize and quote to others... THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM! Help!

Yes. And we need to reform { Fox News HDTV media audience, Facebook media audience, Twitter Musk media audience, Newsmax HDTV media audience, Sinclair Media audience, Joe Rogan media audience, Truth Social media audience, Russia Today media audience, Church Bible media audience, Breaking Bad media audience }. Teaching Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman to ALL audiences is a huge part of We The People being rescued from Trumpism mindsets.

Top voted-comment on posting of Reddit front page. Snark, sarcasm, satire. War with NATO given the Elon Musk Tweet-length billionaire Musk twitter-thinking treatment. A short message that prizes Truth Social and Twitter style of "engagement questions" that are so popular. 

The same Reddit audience will claim that reporters and journalists don't ask "hard questions" or assert important topics when also making money engaging the very same audience (We The People, the citizens). There is no public cry for change in direction. No call for honest and sincere leadership. If anything, given how long Trump has lead the nation with snark and mockery, this message is **cal for* more of the same. TEN YEARS AN SEVEN MONTHS, 3,868 days fucking days of social media users treating USA government as the most entertaining jokes and media addiction.

Putin and Trump create { absurd comedy situations, surreal comedy, contradictory Vaudeville, wild and crazy antics, self-harm promises and actions to USA, a joke of USA } and social media audiences are ready at any time to amplify and add to the tone of mocking / mockery / anti-serious / anti-learning / anti-teaching. AND, blame "The Media" for not standing up to Trump -when it is indeed ***We The People** who prize trash commenting "just asking questions" engagement mind-exploitation.

3 month Reddit account. Incredibly popular comment. Mocking, question. Reddit is the place where serious people think an ocean of shit commenting is good if they can find 2 or 3 edible corn kernels in the turd pile. The bar of "resisting" on social media is to be snark, which is exactly what MAGA runs the nation with. An attitude that MAGA is in on a secret joke an the out-groups (non-MAGA) don't "get the joke" of how rewarding it is to be stupid, dumb, and hate-filled.

One of the reply messages to this comment says "insane".

Yes. The audience of Trump, the fandom of Trump, is all complicity and enabling. Instead of halting all the bullshit social media snark and asserting Dr. Bandy X Lee since October 3, 2017 publication of her book. It is not difficult or time consuming to repeat quotes from a nonfiction book. But people are so addicted to the constant simulation of antics from Trump that they are not only avoiding seriously standing up to take on the media addiction problems of the Fox News HDTV audience... but outright addicted to the billionaire media machines delivering the *breaking news* of every Trump public antic.

Trump is a media addict leading a nation of high-speed information addicts. Engagement, influencer, influencing a population that prizes notification and commenting. Hate messaging Trump is the Reddit audience engagement. The addiction to Trump being on camera and quoted in the media is a bi-directional relationship.

Fandom discusses this all in a casual style. This is a documented PUBLIC figure. This isn't your buddy woo works at the grocery store or gas station. This is a man at the center of attention of thousands of books. But on Reddit, the tone is casual and Twitter-like now. No link to any book, no author name, no call to organize and remove Trump. It is as if sports fans are talking about a injury of one of their entertaining sports stars and how it might impact next moth's playoffs. If anything, sports fandoms can be MORE SERIOUS about citing sources and serious analysis than We The People are about world affairs lead by Trump's White House.

Reddit media empire serves as a training round on how to satire-wash, meme-wash, sarcasm-wash Trump's mass dehumanization as a form of entertainment. Almost always avoided is serious nonfiction learning and important assertions. Tweet-length, Twitter-style, Musk Twitter short-messaging values to dilute goodness in favor of the humor aspects of Trump's antics and self-harm of USA and NATO.

https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1qfhy7u/trump_says_8_european_countries_will_be_charged_a/o04pj5t/

These tiny-short messages on Reddit are incredibly popular. They serve to show that the audience is treating this like a mobster film, like ["The Godfather" year 1972 American gangster fiction storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather). This is what a society of Reality TV addictions prizes as entertainment and audience conversation. Complete detachment from learning nonfiction about Russia's military information warfare against Reddit end-users. Such as: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 story. Avoided in favor of audience peer to peer hyper-banality messaging.

Fandom of Trump and MAGA entertainment, with "LOL" opening of the message. Thrilled to view this all as a screen game, interactive fiction. Trump fandom. Note the age of the Reddit account; only a few months old to jump on the USA total mockery media enviornment of Reddit commenting.

https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qfisui/trump_tariffs_us_president_announces_plan_to_hit/o04wcof/

Trump fandom messaging. Everything is baby-talk and join in with Trump's style of total mockery media environment of Truth Social mocking platform. Compulsive behavior. A population of touch-device addicts who can't resist following the Trump leadership, cult of Trump content and language. Media cult.

* “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when **serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk**, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

Elon Musk Twitter fandom (on Reddit) with the Tweet-thinking short-message *trivialization responses* to complex international affairs. Anti-Malala messaging on Reddit, anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-women learning messaging. That children indoctrinated into { Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Book of Mormon, cults, Scientology of L Ron Hubbard } can never ever be reversed. That children convinced Santa is real for Christmas can't ever be taught reason thinking and more sophisticated comprehension. Binary logic mindset. Messaging to the Reddit audience: do not confront Fox News HDTV, do not let women like Jen Senko https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad even think about standing up to Rupert Murdoch and junk billionaire Musk messaging.

This is what the fandom of Trump wants: people to prize low-effort lazy commenting on Reddit that promotes *give up* on education, teaching, FAQ, Wiki systems to organize and teach. Encouraging maximum banality of Tweet-thinking, following Musk media leadership.

Fandom of Trump. Cheering on more nonsense and chaos against EU / USA / NATO to support Putin's plans. Always adding more mockery / satire / surreal / sarcasm / absurd to the Surkov students outcomes. Elon Musk Twitter short-message thinking banality. Banal mindsets to treat Trump as the most amazing source of amusement and total mockery show.
