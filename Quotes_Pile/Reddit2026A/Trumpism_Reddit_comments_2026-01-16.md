Top voted comment on Reddit. Regardless of intention of the author, this message stands *for Trump*. This is the media addiction of Joe Rogan fandom vs. Trump fandom. And those who *hate Trump* have all the language (English) skills and ability to wage intellectual war AGAINST Putin and Trump. But they are so compulsively programmed by the IRA to defend and admire Trump's power.

I could have Pink Floyd write a song mocking Trump, people would purchase the song, learn the lyrics, and still support Trump! Because the thrill of mocking and insulting Trump is the dominate media addiction at play. 

MAGA believes in hate. Mocking and hate. And the more people show faith in hate and mocking, you are standing on the real estate land that Trump owns. The missing ingredeint to the USA that Trump provided MAGA was: hate an mocking. And MAGA had first conquest rights, the hate flags were planted in anti Barack Obama. Look at Trump's year 2012 Tweet / Twitter record. But since January 1, 2024 EVERYONE, and I fucking mean EVERYONE, has only been teaching one lesson here: *hate harder*. Feedback looping of : hate, mocking.
