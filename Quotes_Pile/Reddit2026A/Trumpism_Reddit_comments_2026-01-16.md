Top voted comment on Reddit. Regardless of intention of the author, this message stands *for Trump*. This is the media addiction **of Joe Rogan fandom vs. Trump fandom. Fiction vs. fiction.** Monomyth vs. monmyth. Like two radio stations playing mostly the same songs but different disc jockey and advertising sponsorship inserts. And those who *hate Trump* have all the language (English) skills and ability to wage intellectual war AGAINST Putin and Trump. But they are so compulsively programmed by the IRA to defend and admire Trump's power.

I could have Pink Floyd write a song mocking Trump, people would purchase the song, learn the lyrics, and still support Trump! Because the thrill of mocking and insulting Trump is the dominate media addiction at play. People would *miss the point* of the song, even if they enjoyed it and sang the lyrics correctly.

MAGA believes in hate. Mocking and hate. And the more people show faith in hate and mocking, you are standing on the real estate land that Trump owns. The missing ingredient to the USA that Trump provided MAGA was: hate an mocking. And MAGA had first conquest rights, the hate flags were planted in anti Barack Obama. Look at Trump's year 2012 Tweet / Twitter record. But since January 1, 2024 EVERYONE, and I fucking mean EVERYONE, has only been teaching one lesson here: *hate harder*. Feedback looping of : hate, mocking.

Of course this *missing ingredients* to the melting pot of USA: { hate and mocking } are not new to humanity. Study the fucking Middle East clergy. Study Ireland. The { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon } clergy have all tried *hate harder* to their flock, the congregations! We have not intellectually faced up to September 11, 2001 lessons! Hate works, to create more hate!

The final sentence of the Reddit comment is great. If I could INSERT two paragraphs and one link into the public Reddit page (hack the output of Reddit). It would likely be:

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

DEAR REDDIT COMMUNITY: Please help. If there were a dirty dozen reflections of articles we the people could go back in time time (time travel) to all take more seriously and all memorize and quote to others... THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM! Help!
