Top voted comment on Reddit. Regardless of intention of the author, this message stands *for Trump*. This is the media addiction **of Joe Rogan fandom vs. Trump fandom. Fiction vs. fiction.** Monomyth vs. monmyth. Like two radio stations playing mostly the same songs but different disc jockey and advertising sponsorship inserts. And those who *hate Trump* have all the language (English) skills and ability to wage intellectual war AGAINST Putin and Trump. But they are so compulsively programmed by the IRA to defend and admire Trump's power.

I could have Pink Floyd write a song mocking Trump, people would purchase the song, learn the lyrics, and still support Trump! Because the thrill of mocking and insulting Trump is the dominate media addiction at play. People would *miss the point* of the song, even if they enjoyed it and sang the lyrics correctly.

MAGA believes in hate. Mocking and hate. And the more people show faith in hate and mocking, you are standing on the real estate land that Trump owns. The missing ingredient to the USA that Trump provided MAGA was: hate an mocking. And MAGA had first conquest rights, the hate flags were planted in anti Barack Obama. Look at Trump's year 2012 Tweet / Twitter record. But since January 1, 2024 EVERYONE, and I fucking mean EVERYONE, has only been teaching one lesson here: *hate harder*. Feedback looping of : hate, mocking.

Of course this *missing ingredients* to the melting pot of USA: { hate and mocking } are not new to humanity. Study the fucking Middle East clergy. Study Ireland. The { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon } clergy have all tried *hate harder* to their flock, the congregations! We have not intellectually faced up to September 11, 2001 lessons! Hate works, to create more hate!

The final sentence of the Reddit comment is great. If I could INSERT two paragraphs and one link into the public Reddit page (hack the output of Reddit). It would likely be:

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

DEAR REDDIT COMMUNITY: Please help. If there were a dirty dozen reflections of articles we the people could go back in time time (time travel) to all take more seriously and all memorize and quote to others... THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM! Help!

Yes. And we need to reform { Fox News HDTV media audience, Facebook media audience, Twitter Musk media audience, Newsmax HDTV media audience, Sinclair Media audience, Joe Rogan media audience, Truth Social media audience, Russia Today media audience, Church Bible media audience, Breaking Bad media audience }. Teaching Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman to ALL audiences is a huge part of We The People being rescued from Trumpism mindsets.

Top voted-comment on posting of Reddit front page. Snark, sarcasm, satire. War with NATO given the Elon Musk Tweet-length billionaire Musk twitter-thinking treatment. A short message that prizes Truth Social and Twitter style of "engagement questions" that are so popular. 

The same Reddit audience will claim that reporters and journalists don't ask "hard questions" or assert important topics when also making money engaging the very same audience (We The People, the citizens). There is no public cry for change in direction. No call for honest and sincere leadership. If anything, given how long Trump has lead the nation with snark and mockery, this message is **cal for* more of the same. TEN YEARS AN SEVEN MONTHS, 3,868 days fucking days of social media users treating USA government as the most entertaining jokes and media addiction.

Putin and Trump create { absurd comedy situations, surreal comedy, contradictory Vaudeville, wild and crazy antics, self-harm promises and actions to USA, a joke of USA } and social media audiences are ready at any time to amplify and add to the tone of mocking / mockery / anti-serious / anti-learning / anti-teaching. AND, blame "The Media" for not standing up to Trump -when it is indeed ***We The People** who prize trash commenting "just asking questions" engagement mind-exploitation. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgressiveHQ/comments/1qf240e/sources_confirm_the_us_house_and_senate_now_have/o01sq7y/

3 month Reddit account. Incredibly popular comment. Mocking, question. Reddit is the place where serious people think an ocean of shit commenting is good if they can find 2 or 3 edible corn kernels in the turd pile. The bar of "resisting" on social media is to be snark, which is exactly what MAGA runs the nation with. An attitude that MAGA is in on a secret joke an the out-groups (non-MAGA) don't "get the joke" of how rewarding it is to be stupid, dumb, and hate-filled.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1qf53t3/doctor_claims_trump_79_suffered_serious_medical/o02k0a2/

Yes. The audience of Trump, the fandom of Trump, is all complicity and enabling. Instead of halting all the bullshit social media snark and asserting Dr. Bandy X Lee since October 3, 2017 publication of her book. It is not difficult or time consuming to repeat quotes from a nonfiction book. But people are so addicted to the constant simulation of antics from Trump that they are not only avoiding seriously standing up to take on the media addiction problems of the Fox News HDTV audience... but outright addicted to the billionaire media machines delivering the *breaking news* of every Trump public antic.

Trump is a media addict leading a nation of high-speed information addicts. Engagement, influencer, influencing a population that prizes notification and commenting. Hate messaging Trump is the Reddit audience engagement. The addiction to Trump being on camera and quoted in the media is a bi-directional relationship.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1qf53t3/doctor_claims_trump_79_suffered_serious_medical/o02avf2/

Fandom discusses this all in a casual style. This is a documented PUBLIC figure. This isn't your buddy woo works at the grocery store or gas station. This is a man at the center of attention of thousands of books. But on Reddit, the tone is casual and Twitter-like now. No link to any book, no author name, no call to organize and remove Trump. It is as if sports fans are talking about a injury of one of their entertaining sports stars and how it might impact next moth's playoffs. If anything, sports fandoms can be MORE SERIOUS about citing sources and serious analysis than We The People are about world affairs lead by Trump's White House.

These tiny-short messages on Reddit are incredibly popular. They serve to show that the audience is treating this like a mobster film, like ["The Godfather" year 1972 American gangster fiction storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather). This is what a society of Reality TV addictions prizes as entertainment and audience conversation. Complete detachment from learning nonfiction about Russia's military information warfare against Reddit end-users. Such as: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 story. Avoided in favor of audience peer to peer hyper-banality messaging.

A population of touch-device addicts who can't resist following the Trump leadership, cult of Trump content and language. Media cult.

Elon Musk Twitter fandom (on Reddit) with the Tweet-thinking short-message *trivialization responses* to complex international affairs. Anti-Malala messaging on Reddit, anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-women learning messaging. That children indoctrinated into { Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Book of Mormon, cults, Scientology of L Ron Hubbard } can never ever be reversed. That children convinced Santa is real for Christmas can't ever be taught reason thinking and more sophisticated comprehension. Binary logic mindset. Messaging to the Reddit audience: do not confront Fox News HDTV, do not let women like Jen Senko https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad even think about standing up to Rupert Murdoch and junk billionaire Musk messaging.

This is what the fandom of Trump wants: people to prize low-effort lazy commenting on Reddit that promotes *give up* on education, teaching, FAQ, Wiki systems to organize and teach. Encouraging maximum banality of Tweet-thinking, following Musk media leadership.

It is sickening, I am incredibly sick that people will not assert { MLK Jr, Malala, Carl Sagan, Education for Adults, Teaching, Neil Postman } and stop this. Fox News was a subset of society in year 2012, but Putin's Internet Research Agency made every social media addict behave even WORSE than Fox News since year 2013. People will not turn to nonfiction serious books by Dr. Bandy X Lee and SERIOUSLY discuss Trump **cult mental health problems** of the MAGA nation.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

The deepest most cherished faith is SNL "Weekend Update" comedy, and Stephen Colbert and comedians making all problems disappear with jokes and memes on television.

Surkov students, Kremlin techniques, since March 2013 exploit this bottomless faith that USA population holds. That jokes and humor are ALWAYS the answer. The PERMANENT FAITH, the BLIND FAITH SYSTEM, that USA audiences hold. Laughter is the best Kremlin mind-fuck.

And no White House has EVER had so much media audience. Audience participation, right on Reddit, Bluesky, Twitter, etc. The entire world media systems prize every fiction story out of the White House. We are dealing with a World Wide Web of media addiction to *fiction* crisis. People are in no way self-aware of heir compulsive behavior to avoid nonfiction since the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica mind-fucked everyone starting in late year 2012. ["Operation Matthew 4:19 trolling" of audiences by Kremlin](/Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md). The University of Toronto teachings by Marshall McLuhan are NO LONGER OPTIONAL!!!

Daddy issues. Either love daddy, or hate daddy. Both groups line up to praise or mock daddy figures.  But whatever they do, they don't want to organize an FAQ or Wiki of top issues to stick to. Just chase around daddy father sex domination topic, "Epstein", while making no effort to organize around leaders like Dr. Bandy X Lee on mental health and what people are attracted to. 

Personally, I suggest people focus less on penis ('dong') size of leaders and more on the money spent on advertising, marketing, photographs, live video, media coverage. Media cult self-awareness. Prizing Trump as a source of stimulating media entertainment.

Trump fandom on Reddit thinks dehumanizing people with media systems, dehumanizing like Fox News media does, is a good thing. People need to face the media addiction to comedy antics is the very mechanism of power. Manhattan Professor Neil Postman's work applies to SNL meme-washing Trump. Trump is first and foremost an entertainer and popular as a celebrity. Facing up that his talent is personality and drawing attention is essential self-awareness of what we are dealing with as an education crisis in society. Trump is unstoppable because he turns minds into charmed attraction.

One man with Trump's problems isn't the concern nearly as much as an entire population that can't get behind Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership. We are all just one celebrity away from even worse outcomes in the world if we can't come to terms with the attraction people have to the dangerous self-harm like Putin and Trump.

I've been a social media user since Christmas 1982, age 13, and my media ecology thesis is that this is Trump fandom! Jesus monomyth is Surkovian monomyth by the IRA into Reddit hive mind / mass man (University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan terminology). Compusive addiction FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MOTHS to high-speed media *rush* of mocking DJT / POTUS / Manhattan NYC symbolism. Surkov students won! This (Reddit comment cited) is on of the many deep fans of Donald Trump in one of the many many many fandom venues!

The comment ending on a "/s" satire indicator / sarcasm indicator / shit-posting indicator does in no way dismiss the perspective Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman would highlight. The TIME SPENT, the FREE TIME, the SPARE TIME crating original absurd surreal comedy about Trump. The addiction to medium. For me, personally, this is Hell and it has worsened every single day and night since Bloomsday 2015.

Fandoms hang on Trump's every single word. The symbolism just pours into audience minds. The diplomatic delivery systems, leader to leader, symbolism of the FIFA Peace Prize planted around the Nobel. This type of response is everything "Woke" about James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. Being incredibly superficial and banal and in no way recognizing that the *distinctive style* of Trump is *the medium* that overrides the message. The patterns of language reprogram meme-thinking in the Reddit audience! It is MASS MAN messaging. Because people flock to it, are so driven by Trump's markings and arrangement of language.

The formal business letter is the *medium* that blows Reddit audience minds. "Introibo ad altare Dei"

They’ve talked about the network as an “information silo” and “a filter bubble” and an “echo chamber,” as an “alternate reality” constructed of “alternative facts,” as a virus on the body politic, as an organ of the state. The comparisons are all correct. But they **don’t quite capture** what the elegies for Fox-felled loved ones express so efficiently. Fox, for many of its fans, is an identity shaped by an ever-expanding **lexicon**: mob, PC police, Russiagate, deep state, MSM, MS-13, socialist agenda, Dems, libs, Benghazi, hordes, hoax, dirty, violent, invasion, open borders, anarchy, liberty, Donald Trump.

THIS ENTIRE REDDIT POSTING! The lack of self-awareness of media addiction behaviors. Trump is a compulsive camera addict, and Reddit audience is compulsive viewers of Trump! Putin and Surkov learned that the more antics and unreality there is, the MORE people blow their minds out!!!

Reddit audience is CHASING dumb shit. Prizing dumb shit. Every media empire, every printing press, every website, is cranking out page after page refreshes of Trump's every stupid stunt, dumb statement. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS NONSTOP!

Mocking a Surkovian mockery is not resisting a Surkov students scripted mockery. If anything, since year 2022, Large Language Models (LLM) systems have put the whole fucking Kremlin Surkov monomyth patterns into RUNAWAY. Russia is no longer in control, nobody is in control. Audiences are flocking on every media platform. Everything Professor David Foster Wallace tried to illustrate in in Infinite Jest has now become the mob mentality of each audience. James Joyce's Finnegans Wake story is iterating over and over endlessly since June 16, 2015 via every meme and message pattern... slower at first, but once Elon Musk purchased Twitter April 2022, October 2022, then ChatGPT 2022... it has snowballed into Infinite Jest world wide web feedback looping!!! 

It's all bullshit, people in mobs are turd-chasing, jumping into the toilet as every Trump turd runs through the River Liffey re circulation system! Media machines are blowing minds into predictable patterns, everyone is high as a kite on Trump content / Trump Family Influencers!

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, **READ EVERYTHING Peter Pomerantsev PUBLISHED BETWEEN YEAR 2010 AND YEAR 2015**, BREAK THE FINN CYCLES! Fhiannaíocht runaway! Halt the fucking machines, Halt and Catch Fire, the printing presses are looping Trump content!!! LISTEN TO ANDREW POSTMAN!

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1qho67x/there_are_77m_evil_people_in_america/o0lhf4v/

Donald Trump is incredibly popular. Every photograph and word of Trump gets sent right to the front page of /r/All on Reddit for over a decade. year after year, popularity of hate is proven and demonstrated. People want Trump to be a role model for their age 7 children . People want to work for boss men, employers, who are like Trump. Media addiction to trash content is blindingly on display of /r/All front page every hour of every day and people can't see it is now worse than Fox News media addicts.

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1qho67x/there_are_77m_evil_people_in_america/o0lff4d/

The taste in bad movies, bad films, bad songs, bad religion interpretations, bad television, bad sports. People put terrible learning into their mind. Why has Jen Senko's film since year 2016 not gotten constant discussion? Serious nonfiction films about media problems don't get discussed while people swim in toxic media. Why is. Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book not constantly quoted on Reddit? People do not seek out nonfiction learning about serious problems. Why is Malala's October 8, 2013 nonfiction book not discussed regarding the rise of MAGA and Trump as the center of all USA attention? So much of MAGA behavior is discussed in a book about far-away Pakistan and Taliban. People do not turn to good leaders like Malala and Dr. Lee.

Posting says "mentally ill", comment says "crazy".

Why is. Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book not constantly quoted on Reddit? People do not seek out nonfiction learning about serious problems. Dr. Lee is right on Bluesky and has only 3,000 followers in January 2026. Sports games, gamers, video games... people treat Trump as a source of jokes and humor, mockery. Yer 2017 is a LONG TIME AGO that Trump had obvious problems. The bigger issue is why so many people clearly demonstrate they can comment on the Internet but can't locate a serious nonfiction book on paper that is one click away! It is a CIVIC DUTY to learn about the real world and promote NONFICTION books that are relevant to Donald Trump's mental health and the mob mentality of those attracted to Trump.

Twitter-length comment. The 2nd highest upvoted, popular comment. Short message that says "cult". There are HUNDREDS of nonfiction books about cults. Why is Reddit community so incredibly avoidant of nonfiction professional books and authors? A link to an article, a quote from a book. Why is short commenting at high speeds not seen as the very problem of society? Trump behaves this very same way with social media. Low-effort thinking, no desire to listen to good ideas, charmed by rapid commenting.

Day after day for over 10 year you can witness the stardom power of Trump and Fox News HDTV. The Anti-reality symptoms and behaviors of people being shocked. But there are never enough examples for people. This GitHub i an absurd driven-crazy by the situaiton attempt to demonstrate how FRAGMENTED people are. In filter-bubble mindsets of not seeing the forest for the trees they tune in to.

It is horrific that a clergy leader hasn't made Bible verse "1 John 3:17" a constant reference and topic as Trump parades around with a Bible for photos. Elon Musk in the White House a year ago with D.O.G.E. - why is the clergy not bring up "1 John 3:17" page of the book? Their whole job is to reference that 2,000 year old storybook. It has never been easier to search The Bible now with computers and large language models (LLM). 

There is a tunnel vision, forest for the trees, problem across every level of society. Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman learning is no longer optional. We are living in all the symptoms of not studying McLuhan!

"IRL" - the ignorance of Comparative Mythology is sickening in USA society. Do Reddit meme addicts, touch device addicts, not grasp that the Bible is science fiction storytelling? The Quran and Torah are science fiction! Are the MAGA fandom on Reddit so poorly educated we think a Church and Mosque isn't a science fiction circle-jerk? A fandom of fiction? Do people seriously believe that circle-jerking was only invented when Reddit went online 21 years ago?

The mindsets of people who believe they invented everything.  Ecclesiastes 1:9.  No wonder *We The People* line up to follow Trump. *We People*.. think ... since Trump is age 79, that he invented everything we live in? You can just sense that almost all people in USA can no longer relate or imagine what life was like before the Apple iPhone went on sale in the middle of year 2007.

* "Throughout his time in public office and on the campaign trail, Donald Trump has frequently claimed to have invented or created common, established phrases, ideas, and even words, perhaps most notably telling The Economist in 2017 that he "came up with" the phrase "prime the pump" just a few days prior to the interview, despite the term having been used in economic discourse since the 1930s. Similarly, Trump stated that "fake"—often used as "fake news"—was one of the greatest terms he ever came up with, acknowledging others might have used it before but claiming he had never noticed it. Other examples of phrases or nicknames he claimed to introduce include "Big Luther" for Senator Luther Strange, which was already in use before their meeting, and the phrase "Make America Great Again," which he insisted on trademarking and appeared unaware was used by Ronald Reagan in 1980. In 2017, he also suggested that he invented the concept of "on fleek", and he later declared "equalize" to be a "new word" he "came up with" in May 2025 regarding tariff policy, despite its usage dating back to the 16th century. Additionally, he has taken credit for popularizing terms like "caravan" and "panican", along with the term "groceries" during a 2025 speech." - Google Search summary 2026-01-20

Germany was not manipulated by smartphone and social media addictions, mass manipulation of Cambridge Analytica and the Russian Internet Research Agency. Doctors of mental health deliberately manipulated the population to be attracted to chaos.

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the [Plot to Break America, page 85](https://books.google.com/books?id=8OW2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85&dq=%22serves+as+a+political+uniform.+And+if+you+have+a+uniform,+you+have+an+army.%E2%80%9D&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X). **year 2019**

"Donald Trump shares altered image of map showing Greenland, Canada, Venezuela as U.S. territories" https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-shares-altered-image-of-map-showing-greenland-canada-venezuela-as-us-territories/article70528720.ece "In the image shared by Mr. Trump on Truth Social, Mr. Trump’s own online platform, Mr. Trump was seen showing the altered map to European leaders. The image appears to be an altered version of an actual photograph of the U.S. President discussing the Ukraine war situation with European leaders in August 2025."

"mentally unwell". Reddit audience does everything possible to avoid touching nonfiction public education on the topic of Trump's mental health. Dr. Bandy X Lee had content all over the Internet to link... off-Reddit...

"STFU", wanting to silence any resistance to Trump. Very popular messaging on Reddit in 2026. To deport people, to have ICE silence people, to block people, to burn books, burn magazines, burn messages. Egoism raging to silence people who disagree and don't want Trump normalized. MAGA values normalized for everyone.

It's right there in the Reddit commenting section. The educated Americans, USA population, with free time and spare time is too attracted to Truth Social postings. (This is a True Social posting screenshot and shared on Reddit social). The attraction to the total mockery is extreme. Social media users could rebel by asserting that Trump has lost his mind to Fox News HDTV and no grip on scientific reality. That Trump is a fiction addict. Citing { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman }. Or the entire mental health of the MAGA movement could be called out through the name of Dr. Bandy X Lee and her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book.

Alas, Trump posted an image on Truth Social and that is what is prized. Truth Social content images of Donald Trump. That is where the spare time and free time goes. Not resisting, but engaging the Trump performance art.

* Quote ::: For all the ways one can define fascism (and there are many), one essential trait is its allegiance to no idea of right but its own: it is, in short, ideological narcissism. “Television is a speed-of-light medium, a present-centered medium,” my father wrote. “Its grammar, so to say, permits no access to the past … history can play no significant role in image politics. For history is of value only to someone who takes seriously the notion that there are patterns in the past which may provide the present with nourishing traditions.” ::: - February 3, 2017 https://danutm.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/andrew-postman-my-dad-predicted-trump-in-1985-its-not-orwell-he-warned-its-brave-new-world/

Meme addicts run the nation. The mindset of meme-think fiction has taken over every area of society. We live in mythology now. Carl Sagan's nonfiction teachings / public writings in thee 1990's have all been shit out and avoided. The PLUR1BUS Apple TV+ fandom knew almost nothing of Carl Sagan, even his fiction "Contact" book and film. People are very avoidant of serious nonfiction science learning.

* “We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. 1995

The Great Dictator 1940 film, Charlie Chaplin acting, makes this very point. 

* "Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost… The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people." - https://www.CharlieChaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

Tell me about it. Everything that has gone on since June 16, 2015 from media addicts / media cult behaviors has been disturbing. The self-harm of flocking to the hate leadership signals of Putin to prize MORE HATE! Hate of women, hate of girls, hate of intellectual learning, hate of nonfiction. It is a constant state of disturbing to be in this monster state. So many fucking billionaire media machines running day and night, never resting, signaling hate - and people do not resist hate. They promote you join their team of hate, party of hate, etc.

Attitudes of: On the Internet, it's all OK to lie and deceive and manipulate people and bully them and get them banned. It is *only* Truth Social. It is Only Facebook. It isn't serious. It's only Fox News HDTV. it's only Reddit. It's only the comment section of New Republic. It's only decorated as a meme, doesn't matter what is says. It's only a cult of memes. On and and. That's the attitude expressed through behavior and choices. Like "it's only paper" when a book is published. Anything can be ok on paper. As if the meaning of the memes and meaning of the books do not matter, because 4Chan everywhere is OK.

September 11, 2001 - 9/11 - people at least had a grip that what a specific Mosque educated and taught matter. But on the Internet, people on Reddit avoid nonfiction books at all cost. The labor to avoid nonfiction books and getting on *the same page* is extreme. So much time and labor goes into creating repetitive comments and AVOIDING same-page understandings.

I can show you they do care. Extreme attraction, time devoted to Trump. People care to repeat over and over "orange skin" in a meme stupor. "Diaper poop" over and over and over. We The People are wilding fandom of Trump. People in no way will **admit that hate is bad**. And hate Trump they do. Message after message liked / upvoted prizing hate. **Trump leads**, and We The People follow. Faith in hate.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

The extreme Fandom of Donald Trump has a poop fetish. Super fans. Ultra fans. Constantly messaging to the world their sexual desires for private jet Epstein sex information and fantasy of scat from powerful white men. Somehow they believe { humor, jokes, funny, comedy } justifies their constant concern for the physical body of Donald Trump. 

It's impossible to describe how "bad shit" is the constant outcome of Donald Trump and the attractions people have to Trump. Bad policies, bad thinking systems (reactionary), bad nightmares, bad treatment of people, bad health care for the population of USA.

I graduated high school in year 1988. A public high school in Fort Wayne, Indiana. And when Ronald Reagan was old in his second term in office, people did not have the poop fetish fantasy that they hold for Donald Trump. I never heard a single person express dreams and fantasy bout an old white man and toilet activity like Reddit audiences and other social users constantly express. Yet, Reagan had many "bad shit" policies and attitudes.

* "Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. When you **went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies** and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them." - Rick Roderick, year 1993, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

I also considered Ronald Reagan to be a rather good public speaker. Where with Trump, it is "bad shit" almost all the time. The attraction to "bad shit" seems to be what the Russian Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Aaalytica have induced in the population. Because even the conversation prize shit-talking, shit-posting, shit-thinking on a vast number of topics on Reddit since year 2013. The audience, We The People, the population seems to prize shit, desire shit, want shit, choose shit, and cheer on shit.

I find the population behavior sickening. The attitudes, values, concerns, interest of the Reddit audience is gross, sick, mentally unwell, brain damaging. To be attracted to every move and shake, every airplane flight or golf outing of one single man - over and over and over since June 16, 2015. NEVER ENOUGH for the shit-lording shit-craving audience. Every area of USA life has worsened. Housing is worse, food is worse, health care is worse, information systems are full f bullshit and falsehoods. Why id Dr. Bandy X. Lee's leadership ignored? Why would ANYONE at ANY AGE desire to live under constant bulletining and bullshit? Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book was published back on October 3, 2017 - why oh why do people not stand up and say "NO MORE BULLSHIT"? There was a film called "The Network" where people famously fallowed a bold leader and got out their living rooms and screamed "NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE"


OPERA_A https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=D-VF24H4Xrc 30,347 views May 9, 2025 "Network | I'm Mad as Hell | Full Scene | Warner Classics"


Where I live in the OPPOSITE. Every day people go into public Reddit social media and BEG FOR MORE TRUMP! They discuss diapers and poop constantly and all the shitty ideas and policies. Nobody says: "Let's organized, stand up, and cite Dr. Bandy X. Lee's book and teach cult deprogramming for hundreds of books at the public library". So much bullshit, so much garbage trash desires people have in their hearts and minds. Cravings for more and more shit!!


* Gaslighting    
Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.    
Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”     
Those who embrace Trump’s reality, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”      
That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.

There is no escape from the fandom of Trump and the widespread shit prizing. Every day, people go to create more bullshit and shitty thinking and values. Shitting terrible values and desires everywhere on every information system. It is impossible to stare into the reality being created by humanity in North America. I do not play video games and escape from reality like so many media addicts to Trump do. I don't stuff horror films and comedy fiction into my brain t make the real world go away. I don't have children, but I cry all the time about the children being raised to seek out and desire bullying of a 79 year old man to get shit deliveries into their children's minds and education. Why would anyone possibly think this is a leader to desire? A leader to follow? Why are people not using social media to educate and teach from Dr. Bandy X Lee's books?

The replies to this message, the thread, is full of denial of how much Putin ad Trump are running circles around Reddit audience. Why isn't Reddit staging a social media uprising? Why is Jen Senko and Dr. Bandy X Lee's name not plastered on every comment? When does the addiction to mocking one man over and over and over and over ever end? Is 3,872 days days of ever-expanding bullshit not enough for these meme addicts using all their free time / spare time swimming in Trump MAGA bullshit never enough?

Is it because Dr. Bandy X Lee is a woman? Jen Senko is a woman? The Kampala Harris and Hillary Clinton programming the Russians put into minds via social networks? Can nobody see the banality of the turd commenting all over Reddit? The Twitter-think logic mindsets?

There is NO SOCIAL MEDIA UPRISING. The fandom on Reddit and Bluesky comment and comment about Trump but will not do OBVIOUS things:

1. Promote Dr. Bandy X Lee. Stop making casual comments about "crazy", "insane", "mental health" and quote a god-damn nonfiction book!

2. Halt entertainment. Trump is an entertainer. Stop prizing Trump as a source of memes and jokes and be serious. https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Grim_Blunt/Stop_All_Entertainment.md

3. Come at the issue from different angles. "Fox News is a cult". Make Jen Senko world famous via social media mentions. Far beyond "Epstein" mentions.

4. Organize sustained / ongoing. I have suggested "every 47 hours" social media meetings / movement. https://github.com/GreatSealUSA/Brainrot_Society_47

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers.

Trump provides hate leadership that so many follow.

https://old.reddit.com/r/California/comments/1qj6woz/newsom_barred_from_public_address_in_switzerland/o0ws0vc/

Media of Reddit media is the center of sanewashing Trump. Millions of non-identity people who for over a decade crack jokes, publish memes, screenshot Twitter, share Truth Social, image after image of Donald Trump. People who think mockery is the greatest form of leadership every devised. Entirely avoiding nonfiction serious books. Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 nonfiction book... avoided. Cheering on the wild parade of antics, day after day. Why isn't a link like this https://www.ScientificAmerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/ shared every other comment on Reddit? Why is it so hard to get people *on the same page* and to stay there?

Yes, it is clear to see that Trump is a professional actor. Trump was on a Reality TV show called "The Apprentice". He is acting. And We The People are enamored with mocking how bad the Tony Clifton acts and performances are.... Mocking and heckling a Tony Clifton act is not resisting.

This very fucking GitHub project is for that very god-damn issue. Why did it go this fucking far? Jokes and humor. It's been fucking TORTURE. There is no fun in any area of society, the denial of how fucked up the thinking is. The avoidance of GOOD FREE-THINKING LEADERS like Dr. Bandy X Lee and Jen Senko.

* “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― NYU (Trump home town) Neil Postman, [Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Page 156.](https://books.google.com/books?id=oup6iagfox8C&pg=PA156&dq=%E2%80%9CEverything+in+our+background+has+prepared+us+to+know+and+resist+a+prison+when+the+gates+begin+to+close+around+us%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

I think the thing that turned the tide was not as much Trump's bullshit, but the speech by our neighbors in Canada. It might have woke a few people to see jut how far it had gone on for so fucking long. the PRETENDING it is normal to joke all day and all night about a 79-year old man's acting and Reality TV.

The media, social media systems, comedy-washed sane-washed humor-washed Trump as a great source of memes and entertainment. Trump's acting as President Tony Clifton has blown minds. Nonfiction books have been abandoned with so many minds blown by LOL LOL at Donald J. Trump's performances. The man never gets tired of standing in front of the camera for meme audiences. 

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by tech**nological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

"Hate" and "conquest" are not considered egomania "medial condition" by this Reddit user. Hate is just normal leaders to people on well-loved Reddit machines. **Tech lovers who love technology seem to have a real problem recognizing that hate is bad**. Video gaming / sports game Reddit users who love tech of Elon Musk and owners of Reddit seem to really be troubled on hate not being something to ignore.

* “Shaw once remarked that all professions are conspiracies against the laity. I would go further: in Technopoly, all experts are invested with the charisma of priestliness. Some of our priest-experts are called psychiatrists, some psychologists, some sociologists, some statisticians. The god they serve does not speak of righteousness or goodness or mercy or grace. Their god speaks of efficiency, precision, objectivity. And that is why such concepts as sin and evil disappear in Technopoly. They come from a moral universe that is irrelevant to the theology of expertise. And so the priests of Technopoly call sin “social deviance,” which is a statistical concept, and they call evil “psychopathology,” which is a medical concept. Sin and evil disappear because they cannot be measured and objectified, and therefore cannot be dealt with by experts.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992

* “For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

Twitter-length message. "The media", the Reddit social media. Why is this Reddit comment not quoting a nonfiction book about media? Why is it just low-effort commenting, over and over, and nobody being serious about their use of social media, the medium is the massage? Why is it that every person on Reddit who posts serious content gets badgered, driven away, run off, silenced, banned? How come media commenting creators don't even NOTICE that book quotes have disappeared, and so many disappeared persons? The intimation and silencing of people on media?

* "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using **crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion."** "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that **there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds**, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just **driving discussion away** completely," she adds.

* “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind.

The dumb a fuck memes and mindsets. It has sickened the whole world, the whole world is having to vomit up USA bullshit now.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

ANSWER: Why are We The People (USA population) putting up with this Trump chaos? I've traced it to Bluesky and Reddit. All the educated people do all day and night is make memes and comment in a fandom of Trump. Trump leads with hate and mocking and people with the spare time and free time **follow Trump with hate and mocking**. Neil Postman's 1985 Book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" explains and details this behavior of high-speed media ecology.

Bluesky and Reddit is an audience, a fandom, to Trump. People don't want to shut down the hate-watching of Trump. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching **THIS IS SURKOVIAN GOVERNING**, intentionally exploiting what Neil Postman was describing in year 1985 as an *accidental outcome, unintentional outcome*. Putin and Surkov in 1999 made this a deliberate form of leadership and governing. Russia found that fiction-based leadership, Surkov monomyth, far outsells nonfiction leadership. They out-did Fox News in Russia. September 7, 2014 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/hidden-author-putinism-russia-vladislav-surkov/382489/ a basic short introduction to a vast complex media ecology complex.

Bluesky and Reddit are the educated people who devote their spare time and free time to meme-washing and joke-rinsing Trump clean. Making Trump the center of attention, with the ideal that jokes and "funny" matter more than compassion and love. This is a worship joke-temple of Trump - Reddit commenting section.

Why are people avoiding nonfiction leaders like Jen Senko? Dr. Bandy X Lee? Jane Fonda is fine, but people need to sustain focus and address all the giggles and chuckles and comedy in the audience that is drowning out. The Trump fandom want to smear shit-commenting and shit-posting about Trump, show is face every hour to poo and pee upon, and dance on his grave every day with even more shit-commenting... that nobody listens to serious and sincere leaders. Dunking on Trump, the fandom of Trump, won't clear the room for important and critical topics.

Information overload. It is fucking impossible to find any solid information that isn't buried in Reddit memes and jokes. The skilled technical people of the world are spending all their spare time and free time joke-cleaning Trump, sane-cleaning Trump because they believe in orange-skin jokes far more than they believe in MLK Jr quotes.

Rick Roderick talked about this information overload. Neil Postman 1992 book. But what' the fucking point. Reddit community is a noise joke meme machine of the most technically gifted and talented people who drown out everything serious and important.
