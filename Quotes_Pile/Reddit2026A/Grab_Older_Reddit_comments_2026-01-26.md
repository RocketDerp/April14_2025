*Hate harder* terrorism training programming. Hate vs. Hate. Hate for Hate. Anti-Malala messaging, tech lovers / machine lovers of Reddit being mentally programmed to prize tech (Reddit cloud computing) an hate people. No desire to educate and teach to reform thinking, only logical binary of dead or alive, tech on or off, kill signaling. Mockery-washing with gang-signaling of special symbolic MiXedCaSe lettering/word mocking is gangland signaling of the out-group hate terrorism (street signs and symbols of the subreddit streets).

Nothing progressive in the message, absent any goodness. Just wanting to see killing and death. **Death cult** of Reddit tech lovers. It doesn't matter that the message specifies "PRESIDENT", as it mean *any President*, even corporate President (Luigi 2024-12-04 worship death cult, murder cult gangs). And really, any person outside the cult, **competition** of Murdoch cult for Reddit cult; of murder for murder, hate for hate race to the bottom of the human mind.

* "That is the **meaning of love. In the final analysis, love** is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil systems. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - King, Jr., Martin Luther (1957-11-17)

Parallel comment about the mindsets of the subreddit closed-minded as hell. "this sub is so bloody defensive that it gets nuts." (sub = subreddit, community, fandom, cultists of season 1 vs. season 2). Season 1 was 2 people in a slow-moving area of USA, I called it training wheels. Season 2 was all of Hollywood fast lane and larger group of detectives, way beyond training wheels for audience into the real year 2015 mindset complexity.

RE: "Joseph Campbell was also a weird technocratic" - no.

Joseph Campbell is married to Jean Erdman, a dance creator of James Joyce. "The Coach With The Six Insides" dance. James Joyce married couple is into technocracy? Technical machine minded man? A New York City man who married a woman from Hawaii and retired in nature of Hawaii! I don't think he was big on city over-engineered life.

* "CAMPBELL: The fact that the evil power is not identified with any specific nation on this earth means you’ve got an abstract power, which represents a principle, not a specific historical situation. The story has to do with an operation of principles, not of this nation against that. The monster masks that are put on people in Star Wars represent **the real monster force** in the modern world. When the mask of Darth Vader is removed, you see an unformed man, one who has not developed as a human individual. What you see is a strange and pitiful sort of undifferentiated face. MOYERS: What’s the significance of that? CAMPBELL: Darth Vader has not developed his own humanity. **He’s a robot. He’s a bureaucrat**, living not in terms of himself but in terms of an imposed system."
* CAMPBELL: "The third function is the sociological one — supporting and validating a certain social order. And here’s where the **myths vary enormously from place to place**. You can have a whole mythology for polygamy, a whole mythology for monogamy. Either one’s okay. It depends on where you are. It is this sociological function of myth **that has taken over in our world** — and it is out of date. MOYERS: What do you mean? CAMPBELL: **Ethical laws. The laws of life as it should be in the good society. All of Yahweh’s pages and pages and pages of what kind of clothes to wear, how to behave to each other, and so forth**, in the first millennium B.C. But there is a fourth function of myth, and this is the one that I think everyone must try today to relate to—and that is the pedagogical function, of how to live a human lifetime under any circumstances. Myths can teach you that. MOYERS: So the old story, so long known and transmitted through the generations, isn’t functioning, and we have not yet learned a new one?"
* CAMPBELL: "Now, the biblical tradition is a socially oriented mythology. Nature is condemned. In the nineteenth century, scholars thought of mythology and ritual as an attempt to control nature. But that is magic, not mythology or religion. Nature religions are not attempts to control nature but to help you put yourself in accord with it. But when nature is thought of as evil, you don’t put yourself in accord with it, you control it, or try to, and hence the tension, the anxiety, the **cutting down of forests, the annihilation of native people**. And the accent here separates us from nature."
* "MOYERS: You talk about this peyote culture emerging and becoming dominant among Indians as a consequence of the loss of the buffalo and their earlier way of life. CAMPBELL: Yes. **Ours is one of the worst histories in relation to the native peoples of any civilized nation**. They are nonpersons. They are not even reckoned in the statistics of the voting population of the United States. There was a moment shortly after the American Revolution when there were a number of distinguished Indians who actually participated in American government and life. George Washington said that Indians should be incorporated as members of our culture. But instead, they were turned into vestiges of the past. In the nineteenth century, all the Indians of the southeast were put into wagons and shipped under military guard out to what was then called Indian Territory, **which was given to the Indians in perpetuity as their own world — then a couple of years later was taken away** from them."

"a crazy narrative of Russia exercising mind control over American voters"

1. So Fox News has no "mind control" over American voters, Rupert Murdoch
2. The Kremlin have mind control, intimidation, over Russian voters
3. Does The Kremlin utilize The Church / Christian religion to control and intimidate Russian voters...
4. Is addiction to fiction vs. nonfiction a topic this Reddit user can discuss or study?
5. Does this user believe that the Mosque, Mecca, Quran science fiction theme parks and clergy have any mind control over terrorist? The Taliban in Pakistan in January 2009? The September 11, 2001 attackers who were suicide-bombers / suicide pilots? Does this Reddit user have any ability to discuss the mechanics of childhood indoctrination into Rush Limbaugh, Quran content, Bible content, Fox News (since October 7, 1996).
6. Does this user have any knowledge or learning about cults? Jonestown, Guyana group that started in California USA?
7. Do people confuse science reality with popular culture fiction? Is there more attraction to concepts like "warp drive" and "time travel" (Back To THe Future) than actual science learning of medicine and how that applies to RFK Jr being in the white house? Russian manipulation via education systems of adult teaching on Twitter: https://www.BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

It is as if this user has no comprehension that people who put fighting but fiction stories into their mind are unable to grasp science and factual nonfiction reality.

Great questions. But the questioning itself is insincere. EVERYONE was manipulated. Cambridge Analytica and the IRA didn't jut mentally manipulate Republicans and MAGA. It manipulated the Reddit commenting section.

People are so programmed to say "both sides alert" that they can't face the Middle East patterns for thousands of years. Torah. vs. Bible vs. Quran since year 635. Science fiction vs. science fiction vs. science fiction. Compulsive addiction to fiction vs. compulsive addiction to fiction vs. compulsive addiction to fiction. Surkov won since March 2013.

HOW DO YOU SHOW you are FREE of the Surkov monomyth? You point to Dr Bandy X Lee's SCIENCE TEACHING, no fiction science story storytelling of Quran, Torah, Bible, Book of Mormon, L Ron Hubbard, Rupert Murdoch, etc. You keep repeating and teaching Dr. Bandy X Lee's compilation and research until every person age 12 and above in USA is on the same page of topics. You point to Dr. Carl Sagan, you point to Neil Postman, get you get people on the same page of self-awareness to compulsive science fiction storytelling of The Bible and Fox News! THEN you study Surkov! Starting with October 20, 2011 - FAR BEFORE the November 2016 election! https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

“We are engaged in an information war and we are losing that war,” she said.

MEDIA_ECOLOGY_LESSON Monday October 4, 2021 when Joe Biden / Kamala Harris were in office, it was still clear MAGA_VALUES cults on Reddit were growing. The January 6, 2021 overthrow of government / insurrection was being actively joke-washed humor-washed all over Reddit. The posting content:

1. people don't read the stories

2. Clickbait headlines are to be reacted to. Even when it is the same story, a different variation of the Clickbait headline revives the topic.

3. Even automatic postings now mine and repeat topics. Copying from one subreddit to another or just reposting in some slight variation.

4. Low-effort early, first comments are what it is about. Reset minds every day to start from zero comments, but the topics are the same, and it's just a different set of people making the same low-effort reaction comments.

Training ground for anti-learning, as what is important in the screen video game of Reddit is to grind away on comments and votes over the same repetitive trending topics. Never learning anything of sustained depth and long-term thinking, but to swim in the time repetition of every 12 hours starting over on the same topics with the same low-effort commenting.

It is a media cult, addiction, of low-effort fast-meme fast-food for the brain. It is fast Internet electronic stimulation like /r/MarshallMcLuhan and /r/NeilPostman described in the 1970's and 1980's as so attractive to the human mind. The same commercial advertisement or re-run of the same content, repeated, to comfort. The messages, comments, and memes come in many flavors, but the clock resets the topics to fresh low-effort thinking with the 12 hour reload of new repeating topics.

Like every tourist who travels to famous places who compulsively has to pose and get photographed in front of famous icons.

MEDIA_ECOLOGY_LESSON  

Monday, September 27, 2021   
The posting:  

Reddit cult behavior I think has a lot to do with the disrespect of 1) FAQ organization, 2) Wikipedia, 3) WikiQuote - common understanding. Instead, it is off-the-cuff degenerating repetition of topics

In the earliest days of social media, Internet, it was obvious that people kept re-inventing the wheel when it came to peer to peer discussion.

Strangers would meet on the Internet, and reinvent the wheel on the base concepts of any given topic.

In the 1990's, FAQ was a common concept, Frequently Asked Questions / Topics / and established answers.

It wasn't that you couldn't question the established answers, it is that you had to not flood the world day after day with scrolling off the pile of the same questions. It was the constant repetition of low-level, easily answered, basic learning that would drive down the community into least-common-denominator.

But profit comes from engagement. And the easiest low-effort engagement is to re-hash and re-invent the same topics as a "fresh topic" every day.

Let ignorance and hate win out! Ignore the February 28, 1954 equation from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and prize hate and prize ignorance. Anti-intellectual pro-violence teachings.
