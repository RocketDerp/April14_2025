Regarding the Gravity Falls Twitter comment and USA "Communism". 

Karl Marx and "Communism" did not create the 2,000 year old Bible verse "1 John 3:17".  Helping out poor people who don't worship Fox News billionaire televangelism religion is not "Communism".

Read the fucking god damn Bible. Verse "1 John 3:17" from Middle East.

I think the irony is that what Krik claimed does not work in the real world.

After a few more ICE murders, sooner or later the people probably will take up firearms. But then the National Guard will step in and will crush them. Trump will probably declare a state of emergency and postpone coming elections.

The people are better of with peaceful protests without using violence or firearms themselves.

Social media is not take "the high road" despite later people will claim that the "high road does not work". Look around at all the people spending their free time and spare time commenting and posting, shit-posting on social media. The high road I keep drawing circles around on the map is: Promoting Dr. Band X Lee as a leader to follow. Her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book. Quoting her numerous articles on the Internet, her book, mentioning Dr. Lee's name more than "Epstein" name. That is one example of the pro-education, pro-rescue, pro-goodness "high road" to take.

* “The human brain can protect us from seeing and feeling what it believes may be too uncomfortable for us to tolerate. It can lead us to deny, defend, minimize, or rationalize away something that doesn’t fit our worldview.”

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you.

Donald Trump leads with anti-education anti-Malala values. People follow Trump's lead. Trump leads with hate, people follow Trump's lead. What people on social media are not making headlines for: Promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee on mental health of MAGA. that is NOT following MAGA, that is not joining in with the values of MAGA and Trump's leadership. Putin won. Surkov won since March 2013. Reddit audiences will not seek out nonfiction serious learning and stick to it. Surkov students won "hearts and minds" to avoid nonfiction. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's leaning is advertising free on WikiQuotes today, Sunday, https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. and Reddit users are promoting exactly what Trump leads: follow hate leadership of Trump. Hate for hate, hate harder.

Children are being taught that hate wins. Trump already PROVED, already demonstrated, that Putin's hate wins over Ukraine and USA. This nation sickens me, makes me sick, the USA that desires hate, desires dehumanization for video game systems and commenting about billionaires. It is not enjoyable to murder MAGA people and murder NAZI and murder Russians. The hate itself, the killing, the addiction to "action" and violence is the thing that makes life non-fun and terrible. Being around anti-intellectual people who spend all day and night commenting about Trump with low-effort anti-teaching instead of learning from Dr. Bandy X Lee is a nightmare I live in, it i reality real.

We should be teaching Dr Martin Luther King Jr's lessons fro 1954. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. We should be teaching Malala's book from October 8, 2013 about Taliban and schools for girls. We should be using Reddit to teach Dr. Bandy X. Lee's October 3, 2017 book about mental health dangers. We should halt all entertainment, sport fandoms, video game playing until the whole world starts taking MLK Jr, Malala, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Jen Senko, and others seriously and gets on the same page. Joy and fun in a peaceful world where we help each other understand goodness instead of raising our children to admire billionaires Putin, Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, poison minds with bullshit fiction storytelling.

We The People of the world are who should prize learning and teaching and what Malala wrote in her October 8, 2013 book before she grew up and gave up on her best observations at age 16. The Taliban in Swat Valley Pakistan are addicts to science fiction story. And so are the MAGA in Texas, a Bible science fiction story.

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”

Born on July 12, 1997, she had celebrated her 16th birthday just a few months prior in July 2013.

Everyone needs to stay at home, use social media and focus on nonfiction. Start learning and teaching mental health terminology and language. Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017. Stop letting meme "Celebration of Ignorance" and anti-Malala anti-education anti-nonfiction run the USA. Surkov won since March 2013.

* "the public trust is also violated if the profession fails in its duty to alert the public when a person who holds the power of life and death over us all shows signs of clear, dangerous mental impairment. We should pause if professionals are asked to remain silent when they have seen enough evidence to sound an alarm in every other situation. When it comes to dangerousness, should not the president of a democracy, as First Citizen, be subject to the same standards of practice as the rest of the citizenry?"

Organization names change. Geography changes. This is not 1937 Germany. We speak a different language than 1937 Germany, we are an ocean apart from Germany. The hate is the problem. Stand up against hate EVERYWHERE. All places. Show the USA has learned from mistakes and go back to American teacher, from Atlanta Georgia USA. Stop cheering on hate teams. Hate vs. hate fandoms. Hate for hate reactions. Hate itself needs to be addressed in the human brain, mind, education.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

They can live comfortably anywhere. They can buy legislators in any country. They are the shadow dictators that control your lives while we pretend that our elected officials still have some power to represent us.

As one MAGA supporter put it to me:

> I believe what Trump is doing is trying to terrorise immigrants who are currently here so that they will self deport en masse. Otherwise this country has no hopes of ever going back to being a white country run by whites in a freedom loving manner.

They admit this is a terror campaign and yet they still support it.

White Supremacist Rage is a core tenet of MAGA values. They don't just believe that Whites should be the ruling class, they are filled with fury when ever they see non\-white people. It the non\-whites are poor, they are seen as leeches and beneath contempt, not really fully human. And if the non\-whites are successful, or wealthy, MAGA supporters see them as having taken something from White people \- something that ought to belong solely to Whites.

Trump would relegate non\-whites as permanent second\-class citizens. He is setting up a two\-tier legal system, in which groups of people targeted by Trump are denied access to the legal system used by the rest of the country. This is a common ploy of authoritarians \- because resistance to these attacks on the rule of law is weaker when these changes do not apply to everyone. It is much easier to pretend 'this is fine' when you yourself are not a member of one of the groups being attacked.

[Video discussing two\-tier legal systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99moLo1Hhg#t=15m33s)

Trump's ultimate goal is the same as that of fascists everywhere:

> The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.
> 
> The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.
> 
> They cultivate hate and distrust \[of allies]. They claim to be super\-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. \- Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944\.

Trump would keep all of us working people in eternal subjection \- serving 'the dear leader' and his regime.

[Don't Be A Sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4)

> "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." \- Benjamin Franklin

This is not about immigration \- this is an attack on all non\-Whites, and anyone else who opposes fascism.

Take Trump at his word:

['Homegrowns are next': Trump hopes to deport and jail U.S. citizens abroad (April 16, 2025\)](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador) 

> President Trump says his administration is actively exploring a proposal to detain U.S. citizens and send them to prisons in El Salvador. Speaking Monday, minutes before a press briefing alongside El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, Trump could be heard embracing the concept.
> 
> "The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You've got to build about five more places," Trump said to Bukele, an apparent reference to prison space that would be needed in El Salvador to house U.S. citizens.

This terrorizing of U.S. Citizens is entirely intentional. 

If you fail to defend other people's rights \- that is how you lose your own.

2 month Reddit account. The ANSWERS: Halt sports gaming, video gaming, non-essential entertainment. See here: https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Grim_Blunt/Stop_All_Entertainment.md

Answer 2: Promote Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership and quote her October 3, 2017 book harder than any Epstein assertions you saw on social media in year 2025. Make Dr. Bandy X Lee a topic every 47 hours.

This is unbelievable but this is what the people wanted , it's no longer attacking brown and black it's white people as well .....

What "the people wanted". Addiction of BREAKING NEWS at high speed TCP/IP 5G+ delivery on the latest model Android / Apple iPhone / Apple iPad in hand. Putin / Surkov / Trump lead with antics and BREAKING NEWS stimulation to feed the We The People audience desires. Round after round of stimulating smartphone / iPad notifications. ABSENT: Repeating and quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's mental health teachings and public education about Trumpism since October 3, 2017 (and even earlier in non-book form).

* meme-talk nation. “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a **perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself...” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985.

So they are conducting a campaign to terrorize residents to achieve a political goal.

Is there a word for this?

Twitter "Engagement" technique of social machines. Ask extremely low-effort trivial questions to trivialize a topic.

And there it is. At the end of the day, this is about controlling elections to ensure MAGA remains in office.


:::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
Not, it really isn't. The elections are Hunger Games focus. Democracy is EVERY DAY, Great Seal of the United States of America is EVERY DAY ALL DAY, not just election days. The inability to IMPEACH and REMOVE TRUMP on ANY DAY is a crisis of thinking only in terms of ELECTION DAYS. We already REMOVED TRUMP from OFFICE, Biden was put in for a full term, 4 years. But that did not address the mindrot brainrot anti-Great Seal USA thinking. www.GreatSealUSA.com lessons are urgently needed!

Her words are literally textbook fascism and abuser. We invade your city with a federal militia under the guise of “making it safer from the criminals and undesirables”. When citizens and innocent people are hurt and killed, and there’s chaos and panic everywhere, we make demands of you to give up your rights in order to be left alone. Demands that have nothing to do with the initial premise of the invasion.

Seriously what does voter rolls, Medicaid, and fraud have to do with immigration? It doesn’t. It’s just a way to get Minnesota and, probably more importantly, other states to bend the knee out of fear this could happen to them.

Reddit audience: **"abuser' - "textbook"** - then why are you (We The People) on Reddit not quoting any nonfiction textbooks on Reddit and asking people to follow Dr. Bandy X Lee's lead and pointing out the Reddit audience is avoiding textbooks? Why not get behind a GenX woman who is standing up to Trump / MAGA male-worship worshiping-Putin mindsets? Teach mob mentality mental health topics!!! https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandy_X._Lee - she is New York born like Trump! Why not let her school the old man?

Extortion! They are killing Americansto get the voter data so they knew whom to target to put in jail.

Organized crime. Organized mythology. Serves to give the population, We The People, a topic to focus on later in the year instead of RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW ON REDDIT SUNDAY TODAY: Promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 as an education campaign, peer to peer nonfiction education focus.

Post Title:      White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says “the memes will continue”  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
This is not a "meme". This is disinformation from the official government social media account. They've posted a lot of stupid memes that are clearly altered images. This one was designed to look real, to deceive.


:::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
The Kremlin / White House using Surkov student methods; plucking on the heart-strings of deeply programmed memes in the mind. John 1:1 Sunday mind-plucking with the Surkov MonoMyth patterns.

Why haven't these social media companies (Reddit and Bluesky) pinned educational posts to people and informed their users to see the *forest for the trees* of how these techniques work on the general population (We The People) full of meme addictions:

1. "But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A **ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable** because it is undefinable." - [Adam Curtis, year 2014, BBC](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)

2. "The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it **climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd.**" - [Peter Pomerantsev, 2014](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8035579.Peter_Pomerantsev)
