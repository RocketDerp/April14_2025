I think the irony is that what Krik claimed does not work in the real world.

After a few more ICE murders, sooner or later the people probably will take up firearms. But then the National Guard will step in and will crush them. Trump will probably declare a state of emergency and postpone coming elections.

The people are better of with peaceful protests without using violence or firearms themselves.

Look around at all the people spending their free time and spare time commenting and posting, shit-posting on social media. The high road I keep drawing circles around on the map is: Promoting Dr. Band X Lee as a leader to follow. Her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book. Quoting her numerous articles on the Internet, her book, mentioning Dr. Lee's name more than "Epstein" name. That is one example of the pro-education, pro-rescue, pro-goodness "high road" to take.

Billionaires don't care. They don't care who's in charge. They don't care about any country. They don't care about any people except perhaps the few close to them.

They can live comfortably anywhere. They can buy legislators in any country. They are the shadow dictators that control your lives while we pretend that our elected officials still have some power to represent us.

:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
As one MAGA supporter put it to me:

> I believe what Trump is doing is trying to terrorise immigrants who are currently here so that they will self deport en masse. Otherwise this country has no hopes of ever going back to being a white country run by whites in a freedom loving manner.

They admit this is a terror campaign and yet they still support it.

White Supremacist Rage is a core tenet of MAGA values. They don't just believe that Whites should be the ruling class, they are filled with fury when ever they see non\-white people. It the non\-whites are poor, they are seen as leeches and beneath contempt, not really fully human. And if the non\-whites are successful, or wealthy, MAGA supporters see them as having taken something from White people \- something that ought to belong solely to Whites.

Trump would relegate non\-whites as permanent second\-class citizens. He is setting up a two\-tier legal system, in which groups of people targeted by Trump are denied access to the legal system used by the rest of the country. This is a common ploy of authoritarians \- because resistance to these attacks on the rule of law is weaker when these changes do not apply to everyone. It is much easier to pretend 'this is fine' when you yourself are not a member of one of the groups being attacked.

[Video discussing two\-tier legal systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a99moLo1Hhg#t=15m33s)

Trump's ultimate goal is the same as that of fascists everywhere:

> The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.
> 
> The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.
> 
> They cultivate hate and distrust \[of allies]. They claim to be super\-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. \- Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944\.

Trump would keep all of us working people in eternal subjection \- serving 'the dear leader' and his regime.

[Don't Be A Sucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGAqYNFQdZ4)

> "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." \- Benjamin Franklin

This is not about immigration \- this is an attack on all non\-Whites, and anyone else who opposes fascism.

Take Trump at his word:

['Homegrowns are next': Trump hopes to deport and jail U.S. citizens abroad (April 16, 2025\)](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador) 

> President Trump says his administration is actively exploring a proposal to detain U.S. citizens and send them to prisons in El Salvador. Speaking Monday, minutes before a press briefing alongside El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, Trump could be heard embracing the concept.
> 
> "The homegrowns are next, the homegrowns. You've got to build about five more places," Trump said to Bukele, an apparent reference to prison space that would be needed in El Salvador to house U.S. citizens.

This terrorizing of U.S. Citizens is entirely intentional. 

If you fail to defend other people's rights \- that is how you lose your own.

Her words are literally textbook fascism and abuser. We invade your city with a federal militia under the guise of “making it safer from the criminals and undesirables”. When citizens and innocent people are hurt and killed, and there’s chaos and panic everywhere, we make demands of you to give up your rights in order to be left alone. Demands that have nothing to do with the initial premise of the invasion.

Seriously what does voter rolls, Medicaid, and fraud have to do with immigration? It doesn’t. It’s just a way to get Minnesota and, probably more importantly, other states to bend the knee out of fear this could happen to them.

This. This is how you deploy a force into a civilian city. You don't send in Fallujah\-cosplaying, wannabe pretend soldiers. All masked \& anonymous, carrying automatic rifles slung over their shoulders, putting down the citizens of a US city who are simply exercising their first and second amendment rights.

Maga Republicans may hate us because we're liberal, but we're also 100% tax paying US citizens with exactly the same rights enumerated in the Constitution.

There are a lot of Reddit messages that boil down to: only voting days matter, only 1 single day matters. To fixate so much on voting that dealing with the Kremlin information warfare right not today (Sunday January 25) isn't important... just voting. Putin's military has invaded Internet media systems with manipulation of executive function in the mind. It impacts behavior of society every hour of ever day, on every area of society. Not just voting days, people are conditioned by Russia to hate and self-harm the USA and NATO.
