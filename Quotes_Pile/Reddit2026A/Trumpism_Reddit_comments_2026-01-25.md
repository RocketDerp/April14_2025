Regarding the Gravity Falls Twitter comment and USA "Communism". 

Karl Marx and "Communism" did not create the 2,000 year old Bible verse "1 John 3:17".  Helping out poor people who don't worship Fox News billionaire televangelism religion is not "Communism".

Read the fucking god damn Bible. Verse "1 John 3:17" from Middle East.

Social media is not take "the high road" despite later people will claim that the "high road does not work". Look around at all the people spending their free time and spare time commenting and posting, shit-posting on social media. The high road I keep drawing circles around on the map is: Promoting Dr. Band X Lee as a leader to follow. Her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book. Quoting her numerous articles on the Internet, her book, mentioning Dr. Lee's name more than "Epstein" name. That is one example of the pro-education, pro-rescue, pro-goodness "high road" to take.

* “The human brain can protect us from seeing and feeling what it believes may be too uncomfortable for us to tolerate. It can lead us to deny, defend, minimize, or rationalize away something that doesn’t fit our worldview.”
― Dr. Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. Published **October 3, 2017**. Page 273. Chapter "TRUMP'S DADDY ISSUES"](https://books.google.com/books?id=g0c4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA273&dq=%E2%80%9CThe+human+brain+can+protect+us+from+seeing+and+feeling+what+it+believes+may+be+too+uncomfortable%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image." - The Power of Myth, published year 1988

Donald Trump leads with anti-education anti-Malala values. People follow Trump's lead. Trump leads with hate, people follow Trump's lead. What people on social media are not making headlines for: Promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee on mental health of MAGA. that is NOT following MAGA, that is not joining in with the values of MAGA and Trump's leadership. Putin won. Surkov won since March 2013. Reddit audiences will not seek out nonfiction serious learning and stick to it. Surkov students won "hearts and minds" to avoid nonfiction. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's leaning is advertising free on WikiQuotes today, Sunday, https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. and Reddit users are promoting exactly what Trump leads: follow hate leadership of Trump. Hate for hate, hate harder.

Children are being taught that hate wins. Trump already PROVED, already demonstrated, that Putin's hate wins over Ukraine and USA. This nation sickens me, makes me sick, the USA that desires hate, desires dehumanization for video game systems and commenting about billionaires. It is not enjoyable to murder MAGA people and murder NAZI and murder Russians. The hate itself, the killing, the addiction to "action" and violence is the thing that makes life non-fun and terrible. Being around anti-intellectual people who spend all day and night commenting about Trump with low-effort anti-teaching instead of learning from Dr. Bandy X Lee is a nightmare I live in, it i reality real.

We should be teaching Dr Martin Luther King Jr's lessons fro 1954. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. We should be teaching Malala's book from October 8, 2013 about Taliban and schools for girls. We should be using Reddit to teach Dr. Bandy X. Lee's October 3, 2017 book about mental health dangers. We should halt all entertainment, sport fandoms, video game playing until the whole world starts taking MLK Jr, Malala, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Jen Senko, and others seriously and gets on the same page. Joy and fun in a peaceful world where we help each other understand goodness instead of raising our children to admire billionaires Putin, Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, poison minds with bullshit fiction storytelling.

We The People of the world are who should prize learning and teaching and what Malala wrote in her October 8, 2013 book before she grew up and gave up on her best observations at age 16. The Taliban in Swat Valley Pakistan are addicts to science fiction story. And so are the MAGA in Texas, a Bible science fiction story.

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013. Read, quote, share the god damned book. Born on July 12, 1997, she had celebrated her 16th birthday just a few months prior in July 2013. The WHOLE PLANET of over 8 billion people needs to get on the same page of goodness.Two world wars was more than too much.

OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGlFU3YW_k Today is Sunday as I put this on GitHub. Malala can translate science fiction to science fiction, she is teaching how to translate nonfiction science education to fantasy stories. 375,876 views September 4, 2017

Everyone needs to stay at home, use social media and focus on nonfiction. Start learning and teaching mental health terminology and language. Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017. Stop letting meme "Celebration of Ignorance" and anti-Malala anti-education anti-nonfiction run the USA. Surkov won since March 2013.

* "the public trust is also violated if the profession fails in its duty to alert the public when a person who holds the power of life and death over us all shows signs of clear, dangerous mental impairment. We should pause if professionals are asked to remain silent when they have seen enough evidence to sound an alarm in every other situation. When it comes to dangerousness, should not the president of a democracy, as First Citizen, be subject to the same standards of practice as the rest of the citizenry?"

Organization names change. Geography changes. This is not 1937 Germany. We speak a different language than 1937 Germany, we are an ocean apart from Germany. The hate is the problem. Stand up against hate EVERYWHERE. All places. Show the USA has learned from mistakes and go back to American teacher, from Atlanta Georgia USA. Stop cheering on hate teams. Hate vs. hate fandoms. Hate for hate reactions. Hate itself needs to be addressed in the human brain, mind, education.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Human symptoms of over-saturation of repeating messages. Islamic year 635 onward repeating Quran indoctrination behaviors in adults. A tightly packed set of monomyth patterns in the mind, public dreams, refreshed and altered over the years. Avoidance of information overload via out-group hate. "Old World Order" before year 1776, anti-inclusive. Anti Free Masons thinking. Loudly and softly, spectrum of volumes and tones, but a smaller monomyth patterns. Anti-science. "Enclosed thinking", often fiction-fixated traditions.

* Avoidance: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal

* Smaller public dream / mass mind / mindsets. Avoidance: “How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is **much bigger than** our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a **little god**, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the **Human Future** in Space. November 8, 1994. 429 pages.

What "the people wanted". Addiction of BREAKING NEWS at high speed TCP/IP 5G+ delivery on the latest model Android / Apple iPhone / Apple iPad in hand. Putin / Surkov / Trump lead with antics and BREAKING NEWS stimulation to feed the We The People audience desires. Round after round of stimulating smartphone / iPad notifications.

Not, it really isn't. The elections are Hunger Games focus. Democracy is EVERY DAY, Great Seal of the United States of America is EVERY DAY ALL DAY, not just election days. The inability to IMPEACH and REMOVE TRUMP on ANY DAY is a crisis of thinking only in terms of ELECTION DAYS. We already REMOVED TRUMP from OFFICE, Biden was put in for a full term, 4 years. But that did not address the mindrot brainrot anti-Great Seal USA thinking. www.GreatSealUSA.com lessons are urgently needed!

Reddit audience: **"abuser' - "textbook"** - then why are you (We The People) on Reddit not quoting any nonfiction textbooks on Reddit and asking people to follow Dr. Bandy X Lee's lead and pointing out the Reddit audience is avoiding textbooks?
