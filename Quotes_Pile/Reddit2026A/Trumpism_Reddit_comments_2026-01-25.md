Regarding the Gravity Falls Twitter comment and USA "Communism". 

Karl Marx and "Communism" did not create the 2,000 year old Bible verse "1 John 3:17".  Helping out poor people who don't worship Fox News billionaire televangelism religion is not "Communism".

Read the fucking god damn Bible. Verse "1 John 3:17" from Middle East.

Social media did not take "the high road" despite people later will claim that the "high road does not work". Look around at all the people spending their free time and spare time commenting and posting, shit-posting on social media. The high road I keep drawing circles around on the map is: Promoting Dr. Band X Lee as a leader to follow. Her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book. Quoting her numerous articles on the Internet, her book, mentioning Dr. Lee's name more than "Epstein" name. That is one example of the pro-education, pro-rescue, pro-goodness "high road" to take.

* “The human brain can protect us from seeing and feeling what it believes may be too uncomfortable for us to tolerate. It can lead us to deny, defend, minimize, or rationalize away something that doesn’t fit our worldview.”
― Dr. Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. Published **October 3, 2017**. Page 273. Chapter "TRUMP'S DADDY ISSUES"](https://books.google.com/books?id=g0c4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA273&dq=%E2%80%9CThe+human+brain+can+protect+us+from+seeing+and+feeling+what+it+believes+may+be+too+uncomfortable%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image." - The Power of Myth, published year 1988

Donald Trump leads with anti-education anti-Malala values. People follow Trump's lead. Trump leads with hate, people follow Trump's lead. What people on social media are not making headlines for: Promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee on mental health of MAGA. that is NOT following MAGA, that is not joining in with the values of MAGA and Trump's leadership. Putin won. Surkov won since March 2013. Reddit audiences will not seek out nonfiction serious learning and stick to it. Surkov students won "hearts and minds" to avoid nonfiction. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's leaning is advertising free on WikiQuotes today, Sunday, https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. and Reddit users are promoting exactly what Trump leads: follow hate leadership of Trump. Hate for hate, hate harder.

Children are being taught that hate wins. Trump already PROVED, already demonstrated, that Putin's hate wins over Ukraine and USA. This nation sickens me, makes me sick, the USA that desires hate, desires dehumanization for video game systems and commenting about billionaires. It is not enjoyable to murder MAGA people and murder NAZI and murder Russians. The hate itself, the killing, the addiction to "action" and violence is the thing that makes life non-fun and terrible. Being around anti-intellectual people who spend all day and night commenting about Trump with low-effort anti-teaching instead of learning from Dr. Bandy X Lee is a nightmare I live in, it i reality real.

We should be teaching Dr Martin Luther King Jr's lessons fro 1954. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. We should be teaching Malala's book from October 8, 2013 about Taliban and schools for girls. We should be using Reddit to teach Dr. Bandy X. Lee's October 3, 2017 book about mental health dangers. We should halt all entertainment, sport fandoms, video game playing until the whole world starts taking MLK Jr, Malala, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Jen Senko, and others seriously and gets on the same page. Joy and fun in a peaceful world where we help each other understand goodness instead of raising our children to admire billionaires Putin, Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, poison minds with bullshit fiction storytelling.

We The People of the world are who should prize learning and teaching and what Malala wrote in her October 8, 2013 book before she grew up and gave up on her best observations at age 16. The Taliban in Swat Valley Pakistan are addicts to science fiction story. And so are the MAGA in Texas, a Bible science fiction story.

* “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013. Read, quote, share the god damned book. Born on July 12, 1997, she had celebrated her 16th birthday just a few months prior in July 2013. The WHOLE PLANET of over 8 billion people needs to get on the same page of goodness.Two world wars was more than too much.

Everyone needs to stay at home, use social media and focus on nonfiction. Start learning and teaching mental health terminology and language. Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017. Stop letting meme "Celebration of Ignorance" and anti-Malala anti-education anti-nonfiction run the USA. Surkov won since March 2013.

* "the public trust is also violated if the profession fails in its duty to alert the public when a person who holds the power of life and death over us all shows signs of clear, dangerous mental impairment. We should pause if professionals are asked to remain silent when they have seen enough evidence to sound an alarm in every other situation. When it comes to dangerousness, should not the president of a democracy, as First Citizen, be subject to the same standards of practice as the rest of the citizenry?"

Organization names change. Geography changes. This is not 1937 Germany. We speak a different language than 1937 Germany, we are an ocean apart from Germany. The hate is the problem. Stand up against hate EVERYWHERE. All places. Show the USA has learned from mistakes and go back to American teacher, from Atlanta Georgia USA. Stop cheering on hate teams. Hate vs. hate fandoms. Hate for hate reactions. Hate itself needs to be addressed in the human brain, mind, education.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Human symptoms of over-saturation of repeating messages. Islamic year 635 onward repeating Quran indoctrination behaviors in adults. A tightly packed set of monomyth patterns in the mind, public dreams, refreshed and altered over the years. Avoidance of information overload via out-group hate. "Old World Order" before year 1776, anti-inclusive. Anti Free Masons thinking. Loudly and softly, spectrum of volumes and tones, but a smaller monomyth patterns. Anti-science. "Enclosed thinking", often fiction-fixated traditions.

* Avoidance: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal

* Smaller public dream / mass mind / mindsets. Avoidance: “How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is **much bigger than** our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! My god is a **little god**, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the **Human Future** in Space.

The Kremlin / White House using Surkov student methods; plucking on the heart-strings of deeply programmed memes in the mind. John 1:1 Sunday mind-plucking with the Surkov MonoMyth patterns.

Why haven't these social media companies (Reddit and Bluesky) pinned educational posts to people and informed their users to see the *forest for the trees* of how these techniques work on the general population (We The People) full of meme addictions:

1. "But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A **ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable** because it is undefinable." - [Adam Curtis, year 2014, BBC](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)

2. "The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it **climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd.**" - [Peter Pomerantsev, 2014](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8035579.Peter_Pomerantsev)

Avoidance of nonfiction serious book reading. For example, Dr. Bandy X Lee's book has been almost entirely ignored by the USA fandom of ICE and Trump fandom. Published October 3, 2017 it teaches and educates about the cult, mob mentality, gang thinking patterns, mass psychosis, MAGA mindsets. People need to be asserting Dr. Lee as a leader to follow in the face of Trumpism / MAGA / dangerous aspects of following Donald Trump as role model.

Yes. Memes are John 1:1. Reddit audience has almost zero comprehension of media ecology.

* “The medium **does things to people. And they’re always completely unaware of this. They don’t really notice the new medium that is roughing them up**. They think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium. As movies are tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content—novels used to be the content—of movies.” — Marshall McLuhan. “This is Marshall McLuhan: The Medium is the Massage”, an experimental documentary produced by Ernest Pintoff and Guy Fraumeni, narrated by actor Edward Binnes and broadcasted on NBC TV (19 March 1967). https://youtu.be/cFwVCHkL-JU?t=195

The context of the posting is an image of Stephan Miller, the Reddit Title plays mind-games to be non-specific in the title. There are a lot of Reddit messages that boil down to: only voting days matter, only 1 single day matters. To fixate so much on voting that dealing with the Kremlin information warfare right not today (Sunday January 25) isn't important... just voting. Putin's military has invaded Internet media systems with manipulation of executive function in the mind. It impacts behavior of society every hour of ever day, on every area of society. Not just voting days, people are conditioned by Russia to hate and self-harm the USA and NATO.

What social media messages need to be asserting EVERY DAY, at least every 12 hours of every day, around the clock... is Psychologists like Dr. John Gartner and Dr. Bandy X. Lee discussions of: mental fitness of leaders, education on why such leaders are dangerous, MAGA behaviors, cult behaviors, etc. "Duty To Warn", and We The People need to ask every person in the entire world with WWW access to help promote articles like this one: https://www.Yahoo.com/news/videos/dr-john-gartner-weighed-trump-191628295.html November 23, 2025 - EVERY SINGLE DAY until we rescue the USA from the manipulation deployed by the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg.

Reddit fandom calling for more images. Not calling for We The People to rise up and confront the cult psychological issues of MAGA and Fox News HDTV media cults... just wanting to spread the image of leaders more. Image cult behaviors. What is being AVOIDED: quoting and linking Dr. Bandy X Lee's book since October 3, 2017. Asserting mental health education, nonfiction books, so people stop behaving compulsively obedient to "Daddy", "Father Figure" leaders as conditioned by the IRA since March 2013.

We need to be doing cult deprogramming and education about what Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency has done to society. Entertaining and stimulating images are not addressing the subconscious exploit that the Kremlin information war agents have deployed to harm USA and NATO.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating **mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action."

People have been mentally manipulated by the Russian Internet Research Agency to view all Trumpism / MAGA / Kremlin / White House as a source of entertainment and sports shows above all else since March 2013.

* “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”

NBA topic, I used to work in social media as an expert for team owner of the Portland Trailblazers; Jody Allen and Paul Allen. It is in no way simple and this message downplaying the complexity of media ecology... bad.

* Quote ::: the way people deal with this is interesting. They deal with it as a form of complexity, a word I have used probably too many times. It makes the people caught in this cusp between an old world and an old paradigm that is dying and a new one that cannot really yet be born. And we find ourselves in that space. And it draws us to people like Ross Perot who say “It’s just that simple… it’s just that simple… it’s just that simple”. That’s **the most powerful political rhetoric in a world** with a postmodern trajectory.

The 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, 1980's, 1990's we had two great teachers directly addressing the public media consumers in North America. McLuhan from University of Toronto, Neil Postman from New York University.

"Fox News"; filter-bubble crisis. https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble

* Published more than a decade ago: “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of **alternate universes**, The Fox News cable channel conveys its **version of reality**, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

So many people have no sense that in year 1890 the USA didn't have mobile telephones and ambulance service. The Native Americans / First Peoples had endured loss of lifestyle and death by disease and technology they had never witnessed or imagined. And the invaders never stopped taking more and more and claimed a magical God that was dominating the whole world.

What is mostly new is the organized information systems. So many "knowledge workers" who have learned from experiments on the public: advertising, marketing, commercial graphics, public relations. Emotionally, Reddit is a constant testing of how to get crowds to chase an image or a pattern of words. Machines run day and night measuring and counting upvotes and popularity with human minds.

* “Ours is the first age in which many thousands of the best-trained individual minds have made it a full-time business to get inside the collective public mind. To get inside in order to manipulate, exploit, control is the object now. And to generate heat, not light, is the intention. To keep everybody in the helpless state engendered by prolonged mental rutting is the effect of many ads and much entertainment alike." ― Marshall McLuhan, The Mechanical Bride : Folklore of Industrial Man.

How many Reddit comments do you have to see in front of you to recognize collective group ignorance. That "meme life" is prized. Trivial entertainment information rules the population of USA.

7 days ago was the dawn of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. All week Reddit could have been saying the obvious: Democracy does not work without *love one another*, "love thy neighbor*, "love they enemy*. Yet, people keep saying "empathy" without quoting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. What is the fucking point of being famous for being an articulate good preacher if nobody bothers to go to WikiQuotes because they are so busy commenting on Reddit. https://en.WikiQuote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.

A world in which every person is in a contest to defeat every other person with ridicule and mocking on Reddit is exactly MAGA Trump USA. Most don't even have to make a comment, just like Fox News HDTV audience passively consumes the entertainment of hate-mocking non-conforming individuals. Mob mentality is the drug, a mindset of being in a tribe / club / subreddit.

* “Hitlerism was a mass flight to dogma, to the barbaric dogma that had not been expelled with the Romans, the dogma of the tribe, the dogma that gave **every man importance only in so far as the tribe was important and he was a member** of the tribe.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. Published year 1955.

Hate for hate, hate vs. hate, teaching MAGA to *hate harder* is not standing up for love. Love one another is core to democrat. The Great Seal of the United States of America is not optional. www.GreatSealUSA.com learning is not optional. It has been joked "the Illuminati", ha har, joke joke, meme meme, laugh laugh, a pyramid with an eye, what a joke we are as a nation without love. I do not "believe" in The Bible or Quran or Upanishads as nonfiction science, I believe in the entire public library of rock music lyrics, poetry, science fiction inspiration. Reading a dozen or two poetry books, one does get a sense that love and compassion are not fiction. Democracy does not work without love thy neighbor. World peace does not work without love thy enemy.

The Bible should be watched with The Terminator film robots. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxoowglHU2w (Gun store shopping) Both are science fiction. The Terminator robots don't preach "love thy enemy". Democracy with hate as the "fun joke" becomes what we live in January 2026.

Yes. We all need to get *on the same page* of goodness, asserting goodness itself. Asserting that the entire society as a group (all of us, *We The People*, PLURIBUS) need a new direction. The posting title itself is great. "Amusement As Usual" with normal films and memes is drowning out "The Little Guy" voices. We do not need more pranks, jokes, bamboozle, bullshit. We need to be serious and start getting behind leaders such as Dr. Bandy X Lee on MAGA mental health. Just saying the world "cult" and joking isn't engaging serious nonfiction books on cult deprogramming.

He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

What is wrong with 'these" people? We The People. What changed... ANSWER: The Internet. Reddit. Trump's popularity can be tied directly to the Internet: Twitter. Logic-think. Machine dehumanization mindsets. Trump represents SYSTEMS, processes, Corporate America, Fiction Public Relations. Meme-think shallowness, superficial. Being so shallow that you want to deport people because they speak differently, dress differently, eat food differently, have sex with consenting adults differently, etc. Wanting to build organizations and gated communities / block people / burn books / burn magazines / burn content because of egoism.

Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! **You are not machines!** You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

I see an entire nation that is victim of Rupert Murdoch and Rush Limbaugh media systems. Even if you avoid them directly, the "second hand smoke" of other people. People who believe Fox News fiction is reality. I've lived in 4 Islamic nations and studied Malala's writings and speeches repeat times. And people are victims of bamboozle on massive scales by very gifted and talented clergy storytelling and presentation.

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth.

People elected President Donald Trump because free thinking is rare. There is so much mental programming from toxic religion clergy and billionaires. People on Reddit do not take seriously why the richest man in the world purchased Twitter. People on Reddit do not take seriously learning from Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman. People on Reddit do not take seriously what Putin and Surkov have done with media systems and the Internet Research Agency. People don't take Jen Senko seriously, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad people don't take Rupert Murdoch problem seriously. People don't take Facebook fandom seriously. People don't even fucking take Mecca global media empire seriously. There is no history teaching on media ecology or self-awareness of fiction running nations and science fiction addiction behaviors.

Trump was elected and has a massive USA following because Trump tells fiction storytelling. Truth Social is a fiction media empire. Twitter, Elon Musk, is a fiction storytelling media empire. Mecca, Saudi Arabia's world leadership of Muslims - is a fiction media empire. Disney / Netflix / HBO - are all fiction media empires. Reddit is a fiction addict club.

So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241

* "Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don’t practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us and we risk becoming a nation of suckers" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 38

MAGA is a product of fiction storytelling by Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Internet Research Agency https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md and all the computer tech companies have jumped on the bandwagon of fiction storytelling. Humans have favored fiction for so long, people have taken it for granted. An anti-education, anti-adult learning, anti-women education, anti-Malala, anti-Wikipedia, anti-FAQ. A society that profits from constant low-effort commenting and rectangle sports games. Predictable rectangle square thinking.

The truly serious problems aren't rectangle sports games. The real problems of "love one another" and marriages, and parenting, don't fit into a video game logic of machines.

Elon Musk Twitter is a nation of suckers, Truth Social couldn't be more fucking in your face that the Internet Research Agency has mind-fucked all you fucking *suckers*. Reddit eats it up, no-identity anti-FAQ anti-nonfiction anti-Wiki culture of turning all information into causal non-serious conversations.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Beavis and Butthead. Reddit audience is the very people who **turned the USA into "South Park" to watch on Reddit**. Because Reddit audience can't face your addition to fiction storytelling any more than Mecca Mohammad { Quran Bible Torah, Book of Mormon } science fictions fandom can face their South Park show. A nation of suckers! Donald Trump is an actor, Trump is acting, they are all acting to variations of SNL Tony Clifton character / NYC SNL of *Trump's home town* comedy empire where so many comedian like Donald Trump became world famous. Trump is a god damn performance artist! Bamboozled every one of you in the Reddit audience playing his Tony Clifton character. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTR8Yj5hg4 NYC SNL performer. AGAIN: Trump is an actor from NYC who plays POTUS Tony Clifton. Reddit *eats it up*. Surkov won.

Surkov won. Putin won. Russia won. NATO lost, look around at NATO in January 2026 and wake the fuck up to what Carl Sagan wrote in year 1995. Nation of suckers to Putin and Trump! They met in Alaska last summer, for fuck's sake. Re-read and KEEP re-reading the quotes from Carl Sagan!

*  Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”
