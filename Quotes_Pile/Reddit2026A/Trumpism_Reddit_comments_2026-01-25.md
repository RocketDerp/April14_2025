Regarding the Gravity Falls Twitter comment and USA "Communism". 

Karl Marx and "Communism" did not create the 2,000 year old Bible verse "1 John 3:17".  Helping out poor people who don't worship Fox News billionaire televangelism religion is not "Communism".

Read the fucking god damn Bible. Verse "1 John 3:17" from Middle East.

Social media is not take "the high road" despite later people will claim that the "high road does not work". Look around at all the people spending their free time and spare time commenting and posting, shit-posting on social media. The high road I keep drawing circles around on the map is: Promoting Dr. Band X Lee as a leader to follow. Her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book. Quoting her numerous articles on the Internet, her book, mentioning Dr. Lee's name more than "Epstein" name. That is one example of the pro-education, pro-rescue, pro-goodness "high road" to take.

* “The human brain can protect us from seeing and feeling what it believes may be too uncomfortable for us to tolerate. It can lead us to deny, defend, minimize, or rationalize away something that doesn’t fit our worldview.”
― Dr. Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. Published **October 3, 2017**. Page 273. Chapter "TRUMP'S DADDY ISSUES"](https://books.google.com/books?id=g0c4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA273&dq=%E2%80%9CThe+human+brain+can+protect+us+from+seeing+and+feeling+what+it+believes+may+be+too+uncomfortable%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

* "Shakespeare said that art is a mirror held up to nature. And that’s what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image." - The Power of Myth, published year 1988
