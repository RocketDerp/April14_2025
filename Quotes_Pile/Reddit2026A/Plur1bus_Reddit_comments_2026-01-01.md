Observe the media ecology of Reddit hive mind: No link, no title, no quotes. Just saying low-effort that it was discussed months ago. This is the feedback loop of what Carl Sagan pointed to in 1995, "Dumb and Dumber", a dumb comment idea sets a very low bar of react-commenting to the previous comment. This New Years day of USA 250, it brings to mind a great educating teacher: ... ... ...     

"Force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe. And you do that by love." - November 17, 1957.

And the posting context is anti-immigrant dog-whistle of Reddit machine messaging: Hindi bad. Accents bad.

So many people who come from Apple iPhone and Apple iPad society who don't understand a story about paper book writing, book publishing, book stores, book fandom are incredibly lost!

>  Whats with all the Vince Gillian quotes

Vince Gilligan is the creator / originator of this science fiction show. He is a huge fan of the Twilight Zone, he used to work on the Fox TV show "X-Files" that had a story about an alien pregnant woman.

Are you so lost that this subreddit topic, "Pluribus TV Show" - you don't know the name of the creator / author? The media ecology of the situation? Have you read much nonfiction?

Social media cesspool, Vince Gilligan SPELLED IT OUT February 15, 2025. My reply to this message that ignores grief emotions and booze addictions of Carol:

> Is Carol intelligent? She might have the imagination to write her books, but intelligent?

Yes. But many hive minded people who favor high speed messaging machines can't recognize grief process, that she lost her wife Helen and her thinking is under the influence of chemical dependence and truama.

Many people behave as if they have lived through an event where over 8 billion people changed in one night. They don't seem to understand a mythology / monomyth story  of *extreme depth*.

No TV show has ever been this deep in all history. That is spelled out at Minute 22 of Episode One, the Zero Hour countdown of "00:00:00:00" in the show. Kepler 22 is emphasized to make the 22 Minute mark a focus.

if you listen to the audio track of Minute 22 you will even hear microphone tapping, a symbol for the audience to really listen to the graduate school message Helen has for Carol. https://mymythos.org/archetype/microphone/

Did you hear the message at minute 22 of Episode One?

Which is the very point I'm making. The ENTIRE SHOW of PLUR1BUS is about that behavior of social media users. Tiny iPhone screens.

Helen dies because she is holding a social media device touch screen, wireless, at the zero hour. She falls backwards like Tim Finnegans.

# Minute 22 Episode One

Helen introduces the book "Finnegans Wake".

The most powerful book ever created by all humanity, the world over.

The book is about REDDIT, the website of Reddit, is what Finnegans Wake is about! I can not spell it out more clearly.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1q1hqjd/vince_called_his_viewers_idiots_and_he_was_right/nx5qkpl/

Americans are wrapped in MAGA clothing, MAGA messaging, parroting the Russian Internet Research Agency patterns without being able to discuss media ecology and { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Jean Erdman, Bill Moyers, James Joyce } teachings. Jean Erdman called out the multiple interpretations of Finnegans Wake in her dance. But Reddit audience doesn't want to connect to intelligent university teachers like Postman and McLuhan. Helen talks about graduate school and James Joyce.

This Reddit user thinks the metaphor crisis is only one single person on one single TV show and can't grasp the metaphor of why Pluribus is from the Great Seal of the United States of America in the first place. Why year 1776 values are put into Latin and all the other symbols that are on the Great Seal USA. A person who thinks the metaphor problem is just the fixation on one Reddit user. Nope. They don't offer a link for teaching, any quotes from nonfiction books, just mocking and insulting one person as conditioned by Reddit society (Reddit hive mind culture of anti-book citations). ... ... ...      

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

"Over-thinking" is a thought-ending phrase, a thought-terminating cliché pattern. Hive-mind thought ending Reddit society. Elon Musk Twitter-think meme-think followers. Anti-book. A story about book touring, book authors, book fandoms, seems to not get the book topic across. Which books are in the story? James Joyce, Finnegans Wake. Wake the fuck up, USA. You are bamboozled by Trump and Elon Musk! Putin won, Surkov won!

The anti-intellectual Reddit meme society of MAGA USA 2026. My reply to this comment:

> Vince giligan fans are the worst dude. 

Vince Gilligan has put the Great Seal of the United States front and center against Elon Musk, immigrant from South Africa teaching. And you think Gilligan standing up against Musk D.O.G.E. makes *him the worst* ever.

Have you seen the fandom of StarLink media, Grok media, and Twitter social? You really think Vince Gilligan is the one leading the Celebration of Ignorance, the tiny-short 9 second message "sound bites" of society? Or is Twitter world famous for 3-second "sound bites" thinking?

> Vince giligan fans are the worst 

Measure how many seconds a Twitter message from Elon Musk fandom is. Go ahead, get out a stopwatch.

* &nbsp;

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

&nbsp;

A decade before Carl Sagan:

"Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information -- misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information -- **information that creates the illusion of knowing something** but which in fact leads one away from knowing", "Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

What's the point of your ignorance and asking this question in such a odd way?

Do you even know who George Washington is? Because most people here seem to have the education level of ELI3.

These were, after all, learned men. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment was a world of learned gentlemen. We haven't had men of that quality in politics very much.

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong.

Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good.

You seem incredibly gullible and anti-education. You consume a lot of Reddit and avoid nonfiction books. You really need to learn from better sources than Reddit garbage information.

You can't discuss one single Founding Father, all you do is "get help!" in your weak mind who can't imagine being a free mason / free thinker against Elon Musk hive mind.

But my Reddit profile has "insane" content you can't name. Because you are delusional, you have media psychosis. You can't face up to factual information from Johns Hopkins University. You just call "politics" a threat to the entire world, a world war of Putin and Trump, just as an excuse to live in your psychological denial that people read a BOOK called "Bible" and hear Jesus in their head in outer-space! And you ignore cults, which are media cults like Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump and Elon Musk Twitter cult.

Donald Trump leads a nation in year 2026 with egoism. Egomania USA. And so many in Reddit think every message is an ego contest. World peace and unity is mocked away with banal "you so dumb" messages. Lead by Truth Social Trump and Twitter Musk... Rupert Murdoch too. Reddit is a hive mind of following Trump now.

There is an important passage in the recently discovered Gnostic Gospel According to St. Thomas: “ ‘When will the kingdom come?’ Christ’s disciples ask.” In Mark 13, I think it is, we read that the end of the world is about to come. That is to say, a mythological image—that of the end of the world—is there taken as predicting an actual, physical, historical fact to be. But in Thomas’ version, Jesus replies: “The kingdom of the Father will not come by expectation. The kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not see it”—so I look at you now in that sense, and the radiance of the presence of the divine is known to me through you.

A tight season of 9 episodes people think has "filler". I consider this to be a core thing many billionaires are hoping to do for audiences. Create a profile what sexual desires you want of characters, what egoism considers boring, feed an entire series into artificial intelligence systems (that billionaires have invested in like crazy for years now, huge investment of wealth and power)... people who's ego desires are Carol to be taller or look 4 years younger, etc. Automate for meme audiences: "Topher Grace is famous for creating fan edits, most notably a condensed version of the Star Wars prequel trilogy (often called "Star Wars: Episode I-III in 85 Minutes" or similar) and later re-editing The Hobbit trilogy into a single two-hour film".

Change actors out entirely, because so many meme consumers find dialog, speech patterns, voices tedious. accents, immigrants, etc. People are blocking social messages all the time out of disgust they hold for people outside their filter-bubble hive mindedness. Gated community, HOA programming for dynamic story rewriting. Billionaires have really invested in the compute development for entire film and TV series rewriting for each end-user / meme consumer audience.

From the book that explains the Latin word "PLURIBUS", published in year 1988.

White House former employee, director of communications    
BILL MOYERS: "And yet we all have lived a life that had a purpose. Do you believe that?" ... CAMPBELL: "I don’t believe life has a **purpose. Life is a lot of protoplasm with an urge to reproduce and continue in being.** "

Again, this is the book that teaches the meaning of the Latin word "PLURIBUS" in year 1988. And the meaning of "Plurabelle" in same 1988 book. I  consider Jean Erdman to be one of the greatest on the meaning of "Plurabelle".

My reply comment:

>  Love the "one story fits all" theme.

One huge pile of stories, starting with the one that truly extends The Bible / Quran story beyond year 635:

* "The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that **James Joyce takes over and develops** in Ulysses — the awakening " - [The Power of Myth book, page 144](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA144&dq=%22That+one+thing+is+compassion.+This+is+the+theme+that+James+Joyce+takes+over%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

CONTEXT ASSERTION: Minute 22 Episode One, graduate school Helen about James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book. The show opens with { book store, book tour, book fandom, book publishing }. 

* CONTEXT ASSERTION: "Camp Freedom Falls" where smiling people, "Conversion Therapy". Again, book assertion. A specific set of books from the Levant, imported to USA: { Bible, Torah, Quran, Book of Mormon }. Carol at age 16 was abused by book readers, book fandom.

* "conversion therapy in the United States, including for lesbians, is predominantly rooted in Christian, often evangelical, fundamentalist ideology. Religious leaders and religiously affiliated organizations are the primary providers of these practices." - Google Search Summary 2026-01-03 morning USA

So the metaphor here is addiction and hive mind conformity of book fandoms. That's the opening of the show. Carol being an author introducing / selling a new book to a fandom that she loathes. Minute 22 of Episode One is the "00:00:00:00" countdown where James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book is introduced by Helen as the most important book to measure against for every form of art known to humanity.

People are still not grasping this Pluribus show... getting the USA Government "PLURIBUS" origin, politics metaphors. Minute 37 of Episode Two (which is PAIRED pilots, two episodes released instantly). The only time the word "PLURIBUS" ever appears in the show is on **Air Force One, POTUS Seal**. It is a doctored POTUS Seal image, with the eagle pointing the wrong way (to the right-wing, not left-wing). 

* It's like telling someone "You shouldn't knock **Fox News HDTV fandom** until you try it. Sure, you'll lose all trace of your original personality, let everything you once valued in your life wither away, and definitely climate change denial and harm your children, but you'll love it, it's the best feeling in the world."

People are entirely not grasping the metaphor mythology of the free masons origins of "PLRUIBUS" Latin word. It is at Minute 37 of Episode Two, the **POTUS Seal on Air Force One**. It is *flying* right over the audience / fandom heads like Carol's books are at the book store / book tour.

We have YEARS until Episode Ten. And not one person here wants to discuss the free mason "PLURIBUS" seal of the President of the United States of America on Air Force One at **Minute 37 of Episode Two**, the co-pilot opening of Season One!  Where else in the entire show has the word "PLURIBUS" been shown or spoken other than that scene with the eagle point right-wing instead of left-wing (eagle bird wing free masons symbolism).

Ok, Air Force One bombs away. I published on Reddit comment. Here is my message markdown code:

ELI5: Minute 37 of Episode 2 of Pluribus. The Air Force One eagle image **points right-wing bird wing**, doctored image by the hive mind.

They already did put deep meaning into it. It is a Better Call Saul *Easter Egg*
