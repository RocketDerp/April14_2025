Observe the media ecology of Reddit hive mind: No link, no title, no quotes. Just saying low-effort that it was discussed months ago. This is the feedback loop of what Carl Sagan pointed to in 1995, "Dumb and Dumber", a dumb comment idea sets a very low bar of react-commenting to the previous comment. This New Years day of USA 250, it brings to mind a great educating teacher: ... ... ...     

"Force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe. And you do that by love." - November 17, 1957.

And the posting context is anti-immigrant dog-whistle of Reddit machine messaging: Hindi bad. Accents bad.

So many people who come from Apple iPhone and Apple iPad society who don't understand a story about paper book writing, book publishing, book stores, book fandom are incredibly lost!

>  Whats with all the Vince Gillian quotes

Vince Gilligan is the creator / originator of this science fiction show. He is a huge fan of the Twilight Zone, he used to work on the Fox TV show "X-Files" that had a story about an alien pregnant woman.

Are you so lost that this subreddit topic, "Pluribus TV Show" - you don't know the name of the creator / author? The media ecology of the situation? Have you read much nonfiction?

Social media cesspool, Vince Gilligan SPELLED IT OUT February 15, 2025. My reply to this message that ignores grief emotions and booze addictions of Carol:

> Is Carol intelligent? She might have the imagination to write her books, but intelligent?

Yes. But many hive minded people who favor high speed messaging machines can't recognize grief process, that she lost her wife Helen and her thinking is under the influence of chemical dependence and truama.

Many people behave as if they have lived through an event where over 8 billion people changed in one night. They don't seem to understand a mythology / monomyth story  of *extreme depth*.

No TV show has ever been this deep in all history. That is spelled out at Minute 22 of Episode One, the Zero Hour countdown of "00:00:00:00" in the show. Kepler 22 is emphasized to make the 22 Minute mark a focus.

if you listen to the audio track of Minute 22 you will even hear microphone tapping, a symbol for the audience to really listen to the graduate school message Helen has for Carol. https://mymythos.org/archetype/microphone/

Did you hear the message at minute 22 of Episode One?

Which is the very point I'm making. The ENTIRE SHOW of PLUR1BUS is about that behavior of social media users. Tiny iPhone screens.

Helen dies because she is holding a social media device touch screen, wireless, at the zero hour. She falls backwards like Tim Finnegans.

# Minute 22 Episode One

Helen introduces the book "Finnegans Wake".

The most powerful book ever created by all humanity, the world over.

The book is about REDDIT, the website of Reddit, is what Finnegans Wake is about! I can not spell it out more clearly.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1q1hqjd/vince_called_his_viewers_idiots_and_he_was_right/nx5qkpl/

Americans are wrapped in MAGA clothing, MAGA messaging, parroting the Russian Internet Research Agency patterns without being able to discuss media ecology and { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Jean Erdman, Bill Moyers, James Joyce } teachings. Jean Erdman called out the multiple interpretations of Finnegans Wake in her dance. But Reddit audience doesn't want to connect to intelligent university teachers like Postman and McLuhan. Helen talks about graduate school and James Joyce.

This Reddit user thinks the metaphor crisis is only one single person on one single TV show and can't grasp the metaphor of why Pluribus is from the Great Seal of the United States of America in the first place. Why year 1776 values are put into Latin and all the other symbols that are on the Great Seal USA. A person who thinks the metaphor problem is just the fixation on one Reddit user. Nope. They don't offer a link for teaching, any quotes from nonfiction books, just mocking and insulting one person as conditioned by Reddit society (Reddit hive mind culture of anti-book citations). ... ... ...      

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

"Over-thinking" is a thought-ending phrase, a thought-terminating cliché pattern. Hive-mind thought ending Reddit society. Elon Musk Twitter-think meme-think followers. Anti-book. A story about book touring, book authors, book fandoms, seems to not get the book topic across. Which books are in the story? James Joyce, Finnegans Wake. Wake the fuck up, USA. You are bamboozled by Trump and Elon Musk! Putin won, Surkov won!

The anti-intellectual Reddit meme society of MAGA USA 2026. My reply to this comment:

> Vince giligan fans are the worst dude. 

Vince Gilligan has put the Great Seal of the United States front and center against Elon Musk, immigrant from South Africa teaching. And you think Gilligan standing up against Musk D.O.G.E. makes *him the worst* ever.

Have you seen the fandom of StarLink media, Grok media, and Twitter social? You really think Vince Gilligan is the one leading the Celebration of Ignorance, the tiny-short 9 second message "sound bites" of society? Or is Twitter world famous for 3-second "sound bites" thinking?

> Vince giligan fans are the worst 

Measure how many seconds a Twitter message from Elon Musk fandom is. Go ahead, get out a stopwatch.

* &nbsp;

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

&nbsp;

A decade before Carl Sagan:

"Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information -- misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information -- **information that creates the illusion of knowing something** but which in fact leads one away from knowing", "Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

What's the point of your ignorance and asking this question in such a odd way?

Do you even know who George Washington is? Because most people here seem to have the education level of ELI3.

These were, after all, learned men. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment was a world of learned gentlemen. We haven't had men of that quality in politics very much.

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong.

Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good.

You seem incredibly gullible and anti-education. You consume a lot of Reddit and avoid nonfiction books. You really need to learn from better sources than Reddit garbage information.

You can't discuss one single Founding Father, all you do is "get help!" in your weak mind who can't imagine being a free mason / free thinker against Elon Musk hive mind.

But my Reddit profile has "insane" content you can't name. Because you are delusional, you have media psychosis. You can't face up to factual information from Johns Hopkins University. You just call "politics" a threat to the entire world, a world war of Putin and Trump, just as an excuse to live in your psychological denial that people read a BOOK called "Bible" and hear Jesus in their head in outer-space! And you ignore cults, which are media cults like Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump and Elon Musk Twitter cult.

Donald Trump leads a nation in year 2026 with egoism. Egomania USA. And so many in Reddit think every message is an ego contest. World peace and unity is mocked away with banal "you so dumb" messages. Lead by Truth Social Trump and Twitter Musk... Rupert Murdoch too. Reddit is a hive mind of following Trump now.

There is an important passage in the recently discovered Gnostic Gospel According to St. Thomas: “ ‘When will the kingdom come?’ Christ’s disciples ask.” In Mark 13, I think it is, we read that the end of the world is about to come. That is to say, a mythological image—that of the end of the world—is there taken as predicting an actual, physical, historical fact to be. But in Thomas’ version, Jesus replies: “The kingdom of the Father will not come by expectation. The kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth and men do not see it”—so I look at you now in that sense, and the radiance of the presence of the divine is known to me through you.

A tight season of 9 episodes people think has "filler". I consider this to be a core thing many billionaires are hoping to do for audiences. Create a profile what sexual desires you want of characters, what egoism considers boring, feed an entire series into artificial intelligence systems (that billionaires have invested in like crazy for years now, huge investment of wealth and power)... people who's ego desires are Carol to be taller or look 4 years younger, etc. Automate for meme audiences: "Topher Grace is famous for creating fan edits, most notably a condensed version of the Star Wars prequel trilogy (often called "Star Wars: Episode I-III in 85 Minutes" or similar) and later re-editing The Hobbit trilogy into a single two-hour film".

Change actors out entirely, because so many meme consumers find dialog, speech patterns, voices tedious. accents, immigrants, etc. People are blocking social messages all the time out of disgust they hold for people outside their filter-bubble hive mindedness. Gated community, HOA programming for dynamic story rewriting. Billionaires have really invested in the compute development for entire film and TV series rewriting for each end-user / meme consumer audience.

From the book that explains the Latin word "PLURIBUS", published in year 1988.

White House former employee, director of communications    
BILL MOYERS: "And yet we all have lived a life that had a purpose. Do you believe that?" ... CAMPBELL: "I don’t believe life has a **purpose. Life is a lot of protoplasm with an urge to reproduce and continue in being.** "

Again, this is the book that teaches the meaning of the Latin word "PLURIBUS" in year 1988. And the meaning of "Plurabelle" in same 1988 book. I  consider Jean Erdman to be one of the greatest on the meaning of "Plurabelle".

My reply comment:

>  Love the "one story fits all" theme.

One huge pile of stories, starting with the one that truly extends The Bible / Quran story beyond year 635:

* "The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that **James Joyce takes over and develops** in Ulysses — the awakening " - [The Power of Myth book, page 144](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA144&dq=%22That+one+thing+is+compassion.+This+is+the+theme+that+James+Joyce+takes+over%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1q2n4jq/does_zosias_you_havent_experienced_it_argument/nxe8qxh/

CONTEXT ASSERTION: Minute 22 Episode One, graduate school Helen about James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book. The show opens with { book store, book tour, book fandom, book publishing }. 

* CONTEXT ASSERTION: "Camp Freedom Falls" where smiling people, "Conversion Therapy". Again, book assertion. A specific set of books from the Levant, imported to USA: { Bible, Torah, Quran, Book of Mormon }. Carol at age 16 was abused by book readers, book fandom.

* "conversion therapy in the United States, including for lesbians, is predominantly rooted in Christian, often evangelical, fundamentalist ideology. Religious leaders and religiously affiliated organizations are the primary providers of these practices." - Google Search Summary 2026-01-03 morning USA

So the metaphor here is addiction and hive mind conformity of book fandoms. That's the opening of the show. Carol being an author introducing / selling a new book to a fandom that she loathes. Minute 22 of Episode One is the "00:00:00:00" countdown where James Joyce's Finnegans Wake book is introduced by Helen as the most important book to measure against for every form of art known to humanity.

People are still not grasping this Pluribus show... getting the USA Government "PLURIBUS" origin, politics metaphors. Minute 37 of Episode Two (which is PAIRED pilots, two episodes released instantly). The only time the word "PLURIBUS" ever appears in the show is on **Air Force One, POTUS Seal**. It is a doctored POTUS Seal image, with the eagle pointing the wrong way (to the right-wing, not left-wing). 

* It's like telling someone "You shouldn't knock **Fox News HDTV fandom** until you try it. Sure, you'll lose all trace of your original personality, let everything you once valued in your life wither away, and definitely climate change denial and harm your children, but you'll love it, it's the best feeling in the world."

People are entirely not grasping the metaphor mythology of the free masons origins of "PLRUIBUS" Latin word. It is at Minute 37 of Episode Two, the **POTUS Seal on Air Force One**. It is *flying* right over the audience / fandom heads like Carol's books are at the book store / book tour.

We have YEARS until Episode Ten. And not one person here wants to discuss the free mason "PLURIBUS" seal of the President of the United States of America on Air Force One at **Minute 37 of Episode Two**, the co-pilot opening of Season One!  Where else in the entire show has the word "PLURIBUS" been shown or spoken other than that scene with the eagle point right-wing instead of left-wing (eagle bird wing free masons symbolism).

&nbsp;

"James Joyce refers to the Irish pirate queen primarily through allusions and a pun on her anglicized name, using the phrase "her grace o'malice". 
The historical figure's real native Irish language name is Gráinne Ní Mháille (pronounced approximately as GRAWN-ya Nee VWAIL-ya), commonly known in Irish folklore by the nickname Gráinne Mhaol (pronounced GRAWN-ya VWAIL). This nickname, often anglicized as Granuaile (/ˌɡrɔːnjuˈeɪl/), literally means "Gráinne the Bald" or "Gráinne of Umhall," and comes from a legend that she cropped her hair as a girl to go to sea with her father." - Google Search summary 2026-01-03 afternoon USA

This show is about *hive mind*, mob mentality, group thinking. People fixate on one single person, not the "corporation" behavior. Team sports, hive minded. Fox News audience. My reply comment:

> Carol is a malignant narcissist. A normal person would never be in a relationship with a malignant narcissist. Because their behaviour is unacceptable

An entire nation just elected Donald Trump to office for a second term. Elon Musk has a huge Twitter audience and fandom. Mark Zuckerberg has a huge customer hive mind on Instagram, Facebook, etc.

I see people admire and want their children to grow up like Donald Trump and have all the admiration, respect. This has been going on since June 16, 2015 that parents have raised their children with Rupert Murdoch's Fox News and told their children Donald Trump is going to be the best future for all the world!

&nbsp;

Do people here not realize that "PLURIBUS" is Free Masons from the founding fathers? Vince Gilligan picked this word from the USA government!

The only time IN THE TELEVISION SHOW "Pluribus" that the word appears is at Minute 37 of Episode Two on Air Force One when the POTUS Seal is shown. Carol is standing next o a eagle pointing the wrong direction on the POTUS Seal, to the right-wing that says "PLURIBUS" on the screen. And the eagle is supposed to be pointing to the left-wing (*bird* wing). And 4 out of 13 stars are missing from the POTUS Seal. The hive mind corrupted it!

This show is about politics, Minute 37 of Episode Two.

> a normal person would set boundaries, which a narcissist always loves to cross.

Did the USA just "cross boundaries" of another nation in the past 24 hours?

People can't even tolerate different interpretations of a TV show in a FORUM dedicated to public discussion. They have to go out of their way to block people and make it clear they can't stand / tolerate many voices. Anti-democracy, anti-goodness MAGA USA behaviors of deporting immigrants, etc.

So the ONLY discussions the past 2 hours, are all by this user. WHO now BLOCKED ME! SO they literally are "sucking all the oxygen" out of the room / subreddit!

This means that ANY other person who comments on any of the 3 postings, I can't reply to. The Reddit system blocks entire threads from the account on down. So there are say 25 people, I can't reply to ANY of 3 postings because of 1 single person!

A "doctorate" who can't capitalize any of their English sentences. A doctor that writes "ive" instead of "I've"

The gas-lighting hive mind here is absurd wilding! 

Is this a Jesus freak? Someone who hers God and Jesus in their head and doesn't want to discuss "Cam Freedom Falls" that had a "conversation therapy"  for Carol at age 16 by Jesus freaks (Bible hive mind) in Pluribus fiction story?

> Christianity

"Christ" is the ONLY WORD in the entire Reddit comment message that they capitalized. Look at the whole message. Sounds like Jesus freak!

Well, "OP", me, which they showed shift works, uppercase works Why is "Christ" the ONLY word they get correct out of all the sentences? Smells like a "Jesus" freak, anti-lesbian Pluribus messaging.

1. How much do you know James Joyce's Finnegans Wake?

2. Do you recognize the symbolism issues at minute 37 of Episode Two of Pluribus with the POTUS Seal? The eagle pointing to the "right bird wing" instead of the "left wing"? 4 out of 13 stars missing?

3. Do you have any education on free mason symbolism? Who are your teachers?

4. At minute 22 of Episode One, Helen introduces graduate study of Finnegans Wake.

5. Do you know who Marshall McLuhan is and what he had to say about Finnegans Wake? What he had to say about literacy and schizophrenia? Book reading and schizophrenia?

The USA is a hell hole in 2026. We are in HELL.

Hell is not a place under the earth, it is a mindset.

Wake the fuck up. Minute 22 of Episode One. Finnegans Wake. Stop acting like I am dumb or stupid and actually listen.

I don't think that. That seems like a misunderstanding.

I think misunderstandings are common and caused by major avoidance of Finnegans Wake.

At Minute 22 of Episode one of Pluribus, the James Joyce book "Finnegans Wake" is invoked.

# Finnegan Wake

One word mocking, so fucking easy. One single word. Anti-understanding. Putin won. USA lost. We are super fucked.

The god damn show name is year 1776 meanings, free masons. Russia won. We are mind-fucked idiots.

Yes. Daring to disagree with a thinking pattern and even trying to compare (comparative mythology, comparing government and social systems, even health care systems). Information warfare isn't new, billionaires manipulating people with Twitter isn't new. But we aren't asserting goodness of trying to address this.

I am linking this comment to show the posting itself got downvoted! The downvoting to oppress any love one another and organization. The anti-wiki anti-FAQ values. The hate leadership of Donald Trump in USA, elected for a second term in office, is a real and serious problems. This show is about USA government ideals, morality and love and understanding. It isn't just an entertainment show.

The main paribus sub is even worse! I've logged here how many people got banned. How can you have a TV show bout USA government ideals and say "no politics". The free masons are overrun by Christians who want to make war with Jewish, Muslims, and atheists. It's like having "The West Wing" an not being able to talk about politics! Or a show about a church and not being able to talk religion. The word "Pluribus" is a religious / spiritual ideal! Teaching!

We aren't even being honest that hate is motivating people. When people wont' acknowledge that Trump leads by hate, people are attracted to hate... like, here, join our team-Christian so we can hate all non-Christina. It's entirely discarding authentic compassion and love. Its like a NFL sports game.

Repeating it. it is "MAGA!" chanting messages. One-world anti-goodness. "FIFA peace prize" cheering audience. People so "go touch grass, go off the Internet" that's the problem. Trump is the golf course grass, Trump is the offline. Pluribus is free masons teaching, we have become Trump real estate "FIFA peace prize" sports mentality. One-word "MAGA!!!" cheering on of Elon Musk and all the other billionaires and no equality ideals any more. People can't even recognize Pluribus is a show about shared goodness and quality! The idea of equality offends people, trump entertains people. A world whiteout Trump is considered too boring. Like the hive mind not having / making war in the Pluribus television show. Too boring. Carol has to drive golf balls into building windows to destroy things.

That's the problem with star trek and star wars. People want outer-space ships to have more of the same, wars and weapon systems. that's the religion. "Big God" big war... big weapons. Wreck whole planet weapons, Death Stars, cool. Not boring.

Actually talking and teaching about world peace isn't boring to me. But mocking it with sports mentality and MAGA seems to be a thrill I can not grasp or relate to. The thrill of being in a hate-drive mob just hasn't been fun the time I have been around it. Blocking people I disagree with doesn't make me feel life on Earth just got better.

We don't have to make Trump leader of the USA. He could just be retired golfing with his friends. But we the people insist on having "FIFA peace prize" sports mentality and team-sports of terrible political parties. Love one another, share, Second Bill of Rights share.

In the land of Trump FIFA peace prize sports mentality Super Bowl coming up faith... working out how to get the best of what Pluribus show is depicting seems impossible for people to comprehend. People want to live in billionaire worship even if they claim otherwise. 

i still have such a hard time facing Neil Postman's 1985 book is meaningless to people. People actually desire "out-mocked" "MAGA" messages like the one I'm commenting on.

it isn't just one or two people. We the society elected Trump a second time! "Celebration of Ignorance' isn't just a word in 1995 book, it's beyond what Carl Sagan imagined. And he was great at imagining futures.

One-word "MAGA!" (wins)< ignorance wins, anti-free masons ideals. Not just Neil Postman, dead author 1985 book. But Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 film. that's what these one-world Fox News media means on Reddit media. people actually DESIRE Fox News media, they don't desire preaching against in organized ways of making Jen Senko a household name and sustained focuses.

There is no resistance. Mock vs. mock, mocking vs. mocking, isn't a resistance. It's mocking. Fox News mocking the world becomes the world. Any goodness gets replaced by mocking. Trying to organize Finnegans Wake and Jean Eardman's work into an understanding of a goodness Pluribus USA nation hive mid goes nowhere when people actually think it is great to have no health care and Luigi gun murders, because it creates images and content of gun weapons. Like star Trek and Star Wars, it creates things blowing up. Ignorance provides death and destruction images. That's why people are prizing ignorance.

I don't find Trump entertaining. That's why the religion / spiritual tool of USA, "Pluribus" Great Seal of the United States of America mattered. But there are zero people here. The James Joyce fandom doesn't want to address the Romans 11:32 ignorance of the church, it wan't to measure and taste the language sentences for language itself. Not what the art is pointing to.

People watch Jen Senko's film and then go on to another film. It's just a 1 hour experience. There is no desire to make Jen Senko world famous, "stand up for the little guy" against Rupert Murdoch. MAGA one, celebration of ignorance is a DESIRE people have. The Pluribus subreddits of "no politics" over a free masons government symbol... "no government talk".... MAGA won. Celebration of Ignorance won. Racism and women inequality and worship billionaires whit ignorance chanting... won!

this Trump "department of war" was telegraphed. September 5, 2025 https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/trump-department-of-war-announcements-live-updates/ - and people don't thing that has anything to do with Minute 37 of Episode two of Pluribus show. POTUS Seal being right-wing bird-wing instead of left-wing bird wing symbolism. Nobody even noticed!!!!

I consider this to be *the point* of James Joyce's work. And why University of Toronto media studies of Marshall McLuhan and others is so important. All that McLuhan and Jean Eardman had to say about Joyce. Because it all relates to { Upanishads, L Ron Hubbard, Book of Mormon, Torah, Bible, Quran, Fox News entertainment HDTV, Putin Kremlin, Trump White house, etc } - inkblot books. Finnegans Wake is inkblots. It's purpose is to make you self-aware of The Bible, the Clergy, etc. But not just 1,900 year old Bible and year 380 on Roman Empire use of the Bible, but ALL media. Including the Great Seal of the United States of America meaning as a master-tool of all media.

I consider the Great Seal to be exactly how McLuhan describes Finnegans Wake!

My message, worth repeating as my 2nd to last before being banned:

> I am not even talking about politics

The magic word "politics" that has no specific meaning. Never precise, never accurate, just "anything"

The fucking FOUNDING FATHERS MASONS is the title of Pluribus show.

The USA is a hell hole in 2026. We are in HELL.

Hell is not a place under the earth, it is a mindset.

Wake the fuck up. Minute 22 of Episode One. Finnegans Wake. Stop acting like I am dumb or stupid and actually listen.

The entire world is going into another world war.

That is a RELIGION, FAITH concern. You dismiss it as "politics"

One of my last messages, worth repeating:

>  Again, I am asking why you think iPhone users are bigotted?

I don't think that. That seems like a misunderstanding.

I think misunderstandings are common and caused by major avoidance of Finnegans Wake.

At Minute 22 of Episode One of Pluribus, the James Joyce book "Finnegans Wake" is invoked.

# Finnegan Wake

Am I loud enough?

Woke? Year 1923? WOKE, "Being Woke" over 100 years ago?    

This 1968 book is what I have *settled on*, it bridges the gap to year 1923 "Finn's Hotel" by James Joyce. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village

Concerned trolling. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concern_troll even uses the world "concerning". Epstein **List followers**, paper chasers, are leading the nation, people who prize private jet sex acts and celebrity smut. Can not explain or quote language. Exactly *what* words have I said on Reddit that are so "concerning".... people are so afraid of listening to other people. They shut down at anyone speaking Spanish, or having ideas that are any way critical thinking. 

Just maybe, the problem isn't me the little guy on Reddit, but Rupert Murdoch Fox News that should be the concern. Is that what the person saw on my Reddit profile? A mention of Jen Senko's name?

My concern is people have a smudge on their iPhone screen and that is why they say in a message they are concerned. Or they just read a /r/LeopardsAteMyFace meme to attack Americans, and that is the mindset that is still lingering when they read my comments. Hangover from the constant amusement environment whatever mocking mind programming subreddit people were in minutes earlier.

They block, they burn books, it is a global problem of humanity that the PLURIBUS TV show is the first to associate with the Free Masons Founding Fathers of the USA. "jumping on the anti-individual free-thinking bandwagon" My message:

> You calling me a manipulator based on nothing is pretty beligerent. Where are your quotes or evidence to prove I am a manipulator?

This quote right here. You hate people. I love all people I love you very much. But you can't tolerate that attitude, you badger and seek out "weak" people in your MAGA USA warmongering "Make America USA great" attitudes.

The only crime is free thinking, independence from Reddit hive mind.

# The 1954 Equation

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

The context is "Pluribus_TVshow", the context of the conversation. "We The People", All of Us, Pluribus. And calling out two individuals, two people, that the society is chasing and following and trending - riding the waves of Putin and Trump. And there is no reason to message if there is no key out. But We The People are self-harming on a scale that needs to be bluntly stated and alarmingly written in English short sentences... but there is a greater context, the Greater Sealing of values.

Reddit profile says "East Coast" person, replying at 4am on weekday.

What I don't grasp about a reply like this is the avoidance of Free Mason Founding Fathers ideals. And Christian is mentioned, but the word "Heaven" and "Eden" avoided. Reddit society takes away the most basic of associations. A man who tortures is a "breath of fresh air".. a man who would not have been allowed to get past I.C.E. to Carol's house is overlooked. 

It his a Libertarian promotion? Reddit itself doesn't even allow freedom in the commenting section, people are disappeared and comments removed all the time in front of anyone who looks close.

Context assertion on Reddit is essential. Minute 37 of the co-pilot Episode Two on Air Force One is the ONLY place in the show I have seen visually or heard the word "PLURIBUS", and it is on a doctored damaged POTUS Seal. This is not just any title, and for the title of the show to appear on-screen is held significant in almost any story. Further this show that ends on Christmas Eve Day also appears on the eve of USA year 250... the build-up to July 4, 2026. With six months for people to pause, rewind, take screen shots, video clips, and analyze the meaning of every scene and dialog.

The concept that you can't force housing and can't force food supply on others I think ignores peer pressure. Carol's dramatic message in front of her house for companionship. By this libertarian logic, marriage age shouldn't have men wanting sex with age 11 boys and girls not lead to punishment or re-education? Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell shouldn't have to follow any kind of "hive mind" legal rules, given they feel recreational sex and pregnancy is based on attraction? 

Hunt down tall the pilot pigeons and buffalo to a point of extinction? Cut down all the trees. Displace all the first peoples out of legal paperworks / red tape systems / greed for Carol's golf club sport? Every man a king, ordering around servants and home delivery. Carol is a storyteller like Vince Gilligan, living off the fantasy that is sold to an audience. What if my popularity with audiences isn't even good enough to earn daily bread? Don't want to tax Carol into equality with me as a less-popular author of commenting on peer to peer writing platforms, would we?

Greed and damaging the environment and wildlife isn't considered a crime. Trees that took thousands of years to create a forest can be overrun with machines in a decade or less. History shows that time and time gain, people are motivated to cross oceans and journey like the Radio Shack man. But what has been the result, torturing out-groups who live in peace and are considered "weak" in not violently defending.

I could go a lot of directions in this message. And maybe I will revisit it. Since Christian was mentioned in the reply message, I will toss this quote upon Reddit media system:

* "There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence." -  Western Michigan University (18 December 1963).

> I think much entertainment is rooted in current politics.

I have argued that I don't observe this show to be "entertainment" as much as I'd use { thought-provoking, alarming }. Issues like homeless, food supply, energy usage, passport controls, language barriers, life on other planets, forgotten Latin ideals of free masons, drinking, book fandoms / story fandoms, grief, suburban lifestyle, etc are made more aware in the mind of the audience. Guns / hand-held bombs as a toy to kill a guest in your house, that you consider your enemy.

I think it is entertaining "enough". I think a lot of money and labor goes into making it. I think copyright keeps it from many people in rural areas that need to see it, and the lavish wealth brand behind the show doesn't appeal to that rural population of MAGA that maybe needs to see it most. But a lesbian who never shows a single sign of Christian faith or Church attendance and outright says "Camp Freedom Falls" smiling abusers is an experience... would rural MAGA audiences find this show more enraging than entertaining? Then again, hate and bigotry sure seems popular sport.

Not the note i want to leave this message on, but that is a problem I have. I would rather we all discuss the entire POTUS Seal and Great Seal of the United States of America - because my concern is the prizing of hate. And this is the only show I can find that titles itself after a year 1776 ideal by the free masons founding fathers... and how few people have ever minded the free mason language and metaphors of symbols and words.

Same here. And it is alarming how many people on Reddit ignore Minute 37 of co-pilot Episode Two on Air Force One. The ONLY PLACE in Season One where the word "PLURIBUS" is in dialog or images.... the POTUS Seal. The Air Force One symbolism has been **manipulated by the hive mind** to remove 4 of the 13 stars and the eagle is pointing to the right-wing bird-wing instead of to the left-wing. These two alternates are in plain view on the screen right next to Carol. The hive mind is manipulating Carol, and this being in the first 90 minutes of a 4-season or 5-season story is significant... the ONLY place the word "PLURIBUS" appears in the TV season!

Notices 911 telephone number message on Ambulance in the show. But everyone is ignoring the "PLRUIBUS" manipulated POTUS Seal on Air Force One. The TITLE OF THE SHOW image has been manipulated / doctored.

Reddit audience, fandom. ELI5, ELI4, ELI3, nothing works.

"incurious about the world around her" - exactly like the Reddit audience, Internet fandom! The tings people are curious about surely aren't the topics of { book authoring, book selling, book publishing, book touring, etc }. Minute 22 at the Zero Hour: James Joyce's books!
