Observe the media ecology of Reddit hive mind: No link, no title, no quotes. Just saying low-effort that it was discussed months ago. This is the feedback loop of what Carl Sagan pointed to in 1995, "Dumb and Dumber", a dumb comment idea sets a very low bar of react-commenting to the previous comment. This New Years day of USA 250, it brings to mind a great educating teacher: ... ... ...     

"Force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe. And you do that by love." - November 17, 1957.

Yes. He is calling himself a "son of a bitch", and his *behavior* is indeed that.

* "In American cultures (both North and South), the phrase "son of a bitch" is a severe insult directed at men who display behaviors generally considered to be highly objectionable, untrustworthy, and contemptible.

Yes. And this is emphasized as she returns from the book tour. At the ABQ airport, her spouse Helen has to take away the car keys. Casually drunk driving when another solution was easily handy. And the posting context is anti-immigrant dog-whistle of Reddit machine messaging: Hindi bad. Accents bad.

The immigrant from the Radio Shack / Storage Unit is so terrorized by audiences of media in USA that he is cramming English into his brain and trying to not be rejected by the social society of USA when he gets to Carol's suburban ABQ Mr. White / Betty white hood.

There seems to be a real issue with Apple iPhone users, fandom of Apple TV+ show Pluribus, who can't seem to grasp more than one iPhone screen-size worth of reading. My reply message to this comment:

So many people who come from Apple iPhone and Apple iPad society who don't understand a story about paper book writing, book publishing, book stores, book fandom are incredibly lost!

>  Whats with all the Vince Gillian quotes

Vince Gilligan is the creator / originator of this science fiction show. He is a huge fan of the Twilight Zone, he used to work on the Fox TV show "X-Files" that had a story about an alien pregnant woman.

Are you so lost that this subreddit topic, "Pluribus TV Show" - you don't know the name of the creator / author? The media ecology of the situation? Have you read much nonfiction?

They are anti-goodness across the board here.  Lesbian women on the show seems to really have them motivated here on male-dominated Reddit.

Social media cesspool, Vince Gilligan SPELLED IT OUT February 15, 2025. My reply to this message that ignores grief emotions and booze addictions of Carol:

> Is Carol intelligent? She might have the imagination to write her books, but intelligent?

Yes. But many hive minded people who favor high speed messaging machines can't recognize grief process, that she lost her wife Helen and her thinking is under the influence of chemical dependence and truama.

Many people behave as if they have lived through an event where over 8 billion people changed in one night. They don't seem to understand a mythology / monomyth story  of *extreme depth*.

No TV show has ever been this deep in all history. That is spelled out at Minute 22 of Episode One, the Zero Hour countdown of "00:00:00:00" in the show. Kepler 22 is emphasized to make the 22 Minute mark a focus.

if you listen to the audio track of Minute 22 you will even hear microphone tapping, a symbol for the audience to really listen to the graduate school message Helen has for Carol. https://mymythos.org/archetype/microphone/

&nbsp;

Did you hear the message at minute 22 of Episode One?

* "Finnegans Wake is the **greatest guidebook to media study** ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

Helen falls backwards, like Tim Finnegan, and is holding a wireless phone. And then all the wireless networks go down, and the lady inside the bar on a land-line phone does not fall?  This is all media metaphors of Finnegans Wake book by James Joyce, Helen's graduate school lessons.

You can lead a Reddit end-user to a paper book, but you can't make them read the book. Horse and water, meet thirty! My reply comment:

> I could only read NASA because it was in all caps.

Which is the very point I'm making. The ENTIRE SHOW of PLUR1BUS is about that behavior of social media users. Tiny iPhone screens.

Helen dies because she is holding a social media device touch screen, wireless, at the zero hour. She falls backwards like Tim Finnegans.

# Minute 22 Episode One

Helen introduces the book "Finnegans Wake".

The most powerful book ever created by all humanity, the world over.

The book is about REDDIT, the website of Reddit, is what Finnegans Wake is about! I can not spell it out more clearly.

> Please be clearer so I can understand you.

REPEATING: The entire show is about Reddit commenting and posting. Shit-posting. [Cesspool of social media](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pluribus_TVshow/comments/1q0rwfi/vince_gilligan_year_2025/). Helen does at the "00:00:00:00" countdown reading social media. That's the themes.
