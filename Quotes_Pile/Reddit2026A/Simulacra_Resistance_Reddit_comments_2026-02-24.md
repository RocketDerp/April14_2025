Most popular, most upvoted comment. "It's a nonsensical dissociation from reality that I will never understand." - that's because you spend your free time and spare time commenting on Reddit with reaction comments. Low-information upvoter on Reddit media. https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_information_voter Every hour of every day voting, not just government election days, but adult education and learning EVERY DAY, even HOLIDAYS, even WEEKENDS. Reddit cult of ignorance.

This comment was made today on the SAME Reddit app, to the **Reddit commenting community, that always seems to avoid serious nonfiction books printed on paper**. When there is a serious crisis of people behaving in destructive ways in USA, the Reddit community can be counted on to avoid nonfiction books. FICTION_NONFICTION - as everyone in USA seems to far prefer low-information upvoting systems and sources.

1. [“The truth is, it’s getting harder to describe the extent to which a meaningful percentage of **Americans have dissociated from reality**,” Charlie Warzel wrote “I’m **Running Out of Ways to Explain** How Bad This Is.”](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/19/musk-ackman-election-misinformation) - October 19, 2024 - America’s gullibility crisis, Zachary Basu

2. From September 9, 2014 which is 11 years 5 months and some 2 weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's capure of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. **It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action."
