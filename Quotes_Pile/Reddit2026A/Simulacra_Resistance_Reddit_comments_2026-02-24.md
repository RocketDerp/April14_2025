Most popular, most upvoted comment. "It's a nonsensical dissociation from reality that I will never understand." - that's because you spend your free time and spare time commenting on Reddit with reaction comments. Low-information upvoter on Reddit media. https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_information_voter Every hour of every day voting, not just government election days, but adult education and learning EVERY DAY, even HOLIDAYS, even WEEKENDS. Reddit cult of ignorance.

This comment was made today on the SAME Reddit app, to the **Reddit commenting community, that always seems to avoid serious nonfiction books printed on paper**. When there is a serious crisis of people behaving in destructive ways in USA, the Reddit community can be counted on to avoid nonfiction books. FICTION_NONFICTION - as everyone in USA seems to far prefer low-information upvoting systems and sources.

[“The truth is, it’s getting harder to describe the extent to which a meaningful percentage of **Americans have dissociated from reality**,” Charlie Warzel wrote “I’m **Running Out of Ways to Explain** How Bad This Is.”](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/19/musk-ackman-election-misinformation) - October 19, 2024 - America’s gullibility crisis, Zachary Basu

2. From September 9, 2014 which is 11 years 5 months and some 2 weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's capure of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. **It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action."

This is not resisting. This Reddit comment, the top most-upvoted popular comment, is normalizing. This is **commenting on MAGA**, this is not RESISTING MAGA. Reddit in February 2026 is a FANDOM of MAGA that grades and comments upon MAGA media. No call to intellectual arms, no remedial morality lessons, just commenting about the Reddit vibes fandom of Twitter billionaire Elon Musk MAGA media systems. Why is Reddit commenting community not quoting and repeating Dr. Bandy X Lee, because she is a woman? Because she isn't a white woman? Why is Reddit not repeating Dr. Lee?

Reddit community (these comments) isn't resisting anything. Reddit fandom is gulping down the Elon Musk Twitter simulation of resisting. **3 small words** "This you dipshit?", junk media, Trumpism. Back and forth tiny messages inside the comment box thinking. Avoiding nonfiction. All 3 of these replies assert nothing good. We are in extreme crisis of Twitter-thinking Tweet-mindsets. CIVIC_DUTY_WE_PEOPLE to share nonfiction relevant urgent topics, such as Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 people published October 3, 2017 to the general public about the danger of Donald Trump. Instead, free time and spare time people spend on Reddit commenting about the situation in a passive, matter of fact, way with no call to intellectual action. This has gone on year after year after year in USA, people commenting about others calling people "dumb-shit". Study the screen shot: Donald Trump leads with "dumb-shit" and people reply commenting in a way that follows the Trump anti-intellectual leadership.

This entire posting on /r/All front page is the Reddit community celebrating the ignorance of Tweet-thinking society 2026.

This entire Reddit posting is a simulation of resisting. People making low-effort patterns of questions and blaming only figureheads. The ENTIRE SOCIETY, including Reddit comment community, has largely abandoned nonfiction book reading since year 2013 in favor of low-information social upvoting and filter bubbles.

EXPLAIN AND PONDER EXPLAIN_AND_PONDER_AND_CONTEMPLATE_FOREST_FOR_TREES why do you not see Rupert Murdoch not being blamed constantly in every comment? Many White House employees are from Fox News HDTV! That is where they were trained and educated on media practitioners of what AUDIENCES desire. Reddit users are doing exactly what Fox News audiences do: mocking, avoiding nonfiction serious books on paper! Mocking and mockery against out-groups. That's the simulation. Feedback looping, game looping. Media vs. media. Mocking vs. Mocking. MOCK_MOCK_MOCKERY hate vs. hate. Out-group hate vs. out-group hate.

Framing this as "clever", it isn't. It's celebration of ignorance. It is prizing ignorant content off another platform (Twitter screen shot?) and setting an extremely low bar of measure for "clever" and really it's anti-intellectual programming.

This content on Reddit isn't resisting, it's engaging, it's garbage-in garbage-out, feeding adults on Reddit ignorance. This has been ongoing with the cults of ignorance since year 2013. Surkov won since March 2013. Note the prized screen shot image says keyword: "Leftist" simulation back and forth simple-think mindsets. Left-right brain-rot mindsets. BRAIN_ROT_LEFT_RIGHT_LIB_CON_NAME_AVOIDANCE - as this wildcard meaning can be played with to say "pro-cancer", as in this Trump Kremlin media messaging method.
