A tiny-short Tweet-think message. No link, no author name, no book titles, no quotes. The most up-voted comment on the top of front page of Reddit.

What is avoided in this Reddit society is facing up to the pattern. The medical doctors who work for Trump are not all age 79 dementia and senile. They are age 45 men with medical degrees. And many of them. But Reddit society and Bluesky society fixate on just the President Tony Clifton performances from the leaders.

This is a "seeing the forest for the trees" problem. An inability to organize and see media systems like Fox News HDTV audience and others as thriving off falsehoods. Taking on in an organized sustained way, not one tree at a time, but teaching how people behave in groups. Mob mentality of entire audiences, Reddit audiences, Fox News HDTV audiences.

“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! **My god is a little god**, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, [Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space.
