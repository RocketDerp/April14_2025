A tiny-short Tweet-think message. No link, no author name, no book titles, no quotes. The most up-voted comment on the top of front page of Reddit.

What is avoided in this Reddit society is facing up to the pattern. The medical doctors who work for Trump are not all age 79 dementia and senile. They are age 45 men with medical degrees. And many of them. But Reddit society and Bluesky society fixate on just the President Tony Clifton performances from the leaders.

This is a "seeing the forest for the trees" problem. An inability to organize and see media systems like Fox News HDTV audience and others as thriving off falsehoods. Taking on in an organized sustained way, not one tree at a time, but teaching how people behave in groups. Mob mentality of entire audiences, Reddit audiences, Fox News HDTV audiences.

Trump is a master of crating conflicting paradox information. Surkov students. People get attracted to monomyth paradox story patterns and abandon science thinking in favor of mythology monomyth patterns.

“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! **My god is a little god**, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, [Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space.

Everything is Trump entertainment. Nothing can stop people from putting entertainment of harming others and dominating others above all else. Weapon systems to remove people, natives, existing population. Conquest of of the planet as Campbell wrote in 1988 book. 

All this USA anti-goodness went too far in year 2015 for me. I've never recovered. What people prize, prizing hate, prizing racism, prizing women being slaves to billionaires and play-toys.

I've not been able to get over people putting so much desire for Epstein and not bottom-up reformation of morality. Malala being so ignored. I can't go 24 hours without seeing a need for people to grasp that love and peace is enjoyable. But I guess people want war movies, star wars laser battles and Call of Duty and whatever Steam combat games. Repetitive warfare / fighting things.

But it is so anti-wiki, anti-FAQ, anti-goodness following Trump's lead of just removing history by high-speed media content. By doing antics like this flag event, or addressing drug abuse issues with military weapons. Rich people still get recreational drugs, this is about dominating poor nations and poor drug users. It's about luxuries (drugs and entertainment) for the rich and prison for the poor.

yes. "Stand up for the Little Guy" is exactly the value that has been discarded. Today is Sunday: the "least of these" Christian values. Competition to "win" sports values on map lines and concentrate with as a high score for out of control men...

It is like cheering on a sports star to win. It doesn't benefit your life, but the human mind can witness it. A rectangle basketball or football field isn't creating housing or health care for perplex. It's just exploiting some pattern in the brain. And people cheer on MAGA billionaires in USA like they are sports players winning a high score of more wealth than anyone else. More military kills or whatever negative terrible values people are cheering on.

The "FIFA sports peace prize"... I mean it's what is happening! 

Like Palestine attacking Israel for a god they imagine in outer space, willing to murder and die and create constant fear of another attack. And the amount of labor put into begging or something better (supporting Malala's year 2013 writings and ideas) 

I can see cheering on a team taking a space ship to mars or beyond, but cheering on a rich man's sports players in a rectangle while others are homeless and without health care. "FIFA pica prize". 

Neil postman's 1985 book and people not seeing that *watching* FIFA and *watching billionaires*,some sickness of amusement / entertainment. It isn't enjoyable.

"be wary of the… overquick reduction of complexity. If some of this lecture has seemed a little weird or to go a little too far, it’s because I don’t want to reduce quite all of this to slogans. On the other hand, I don’t want it to not be funny, because part of the postmodern trajectory itself is a rather humorous joke on the human race which laboured for millennia to reduce working hours in order to produce leisure so we could enjoy this very leisure that then turns in a kind of vengeful act against us absorbing our leisure time, which was to be our living time, into **time now spent in the service of what can only be called this inhuman spectacle**. I mean, it’s a very bizarre and twisted fate to which postmodernity has led us. So I would be wary of simple answers to this." - Rick Roderick, 1993

The phrase "alternative facts" originated on January 22, 2017, when Kellyanne Conway, then Counselor to President Trump, used it on NBC's Meet the Press to defend White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's false claims about the attendance numbers at Donald Trump's inauguration. Chuck Todd, the interviewer, challenged this, stating, "Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods," highlighting the moment as a pivotal instance of political rhetoric"

This discussion parallels my horror with Pluribus TV show audience since the series started. People *choose* the worst possible interpretation of the Great Seal of the United States. Banality. Star Wars fans and teachers have all ignored Joseph Campbell's two books from 1987 and 1988. People have no desire to read nonfiction of what motivates people after September 11, 2001 terrorism attacks. Even Howard Bloom's books get ignored. The avoidance of books on serious meanings.

Even the avoidance of learning Bible verses in the face of horrific misunderstandings of The Bible in USA.

Always these suggestions on Reddit. The answer to ChatGPT and Grok AI filling the Internet with fiction, the answer to Rupert Murdoch fiction entertainment news network: **Add more fiction**! Always more fiction. That is the meme addiction of Reddit audience, cravings for more fiction storytelling. [This desire and attitude is cheering it on, it is "Celebration of Ignorance" as defined in year 1995 by Carl Sagan. Quote from Carl Sagan on this link](../Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md). Since June 16, 2015 it has been endlessly expanding more and more faith that additional fiction and adding more tragedy to the information commons is a good thing.

Top voted comment, top of page. Tiny-short twiter-length blueksy-length message. Promotes *hate harder* as is very popular on Reddit. That the answer to MAGA hate is always add more hate. Sunday today, this is the Church of fiction (Bible also fiction) that people go to: *hate hate hate, mock mock mock* tracks. This is an audience laugh-track message of *fuck humans, hate harder*. Exactly what Putin's IRA conditioned in Reddit minds since March 2013. More hate, more war, more dehumanization, more mental attitudes and messages to consume on how great "fuck you" is.

Simplistic comparisons "like Hitler", "Epstein List" over and over. That do not point to any book title, author name, etc. People do not fundamentally grasp morality. We have to educate and teach morality. We have to mace the case for a peaceful loving Pluribus world. People have made the case for billionaires ruling with advertising and marketing, and people can't promote The Little Gal Jen Senko on Reddit comments. Hitler is dead, there is no need to promote Hitler's name over and over. Everyone knows Hitler. What people do not know is Jen Senko's name and her film.

The world won't remember that Bluesky and Reddit people protested day and night and halted all entertainment. Because people were so amused mocking and laughing and insulting the orange skin of Donald Trump that they didn't want to remove him from the center of attention! The world will have images of all the memes and nobody will remember what never happened: treating a serious problem seriously. Calling for emergency measures... no more entertainment.

People will not use social media to LEAD the nation towards goodness, instead Twitter social (Musk) and Truth Social and Fox News HDTV lead the nation to self-harm with the programming of Russia's mindsets. Social media users will call you sick and say you need mental treatment for being alarmed / disturbed about Donald Trump leading the nation and what he is dong / and what RFK Jr is doing, etc.

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

People will not discuss Russian information warfare on Reddit. How Russia attacked the citizens of the nation. The population. The smartphone users, social media users, news media Internet users. Reddit user is saying they are shocked, surprised, mind blown what happened with Trump popularity. But popularity itself has become toxic.

* "we get for the first time a phenomenon never known in polling which is the phenomenon of not liking a person, but of liking liking a person. This is a sign you are dealing with the hyperreal. Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. When you went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them. What was popular was his popularity. And I don’t think that Reagan’s alone in this. Show business figures had this same thing go on for years." - Rick Roderick, Duke University, year 1993 https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

New Reddit account in /r/Politics - note that absence of book titles, links, author names, quotes from a book. 

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

[Read page: Donald Trump is so Obviously Bad](/Grim_Blunt/Donald_Trump_is_so_Obvious.md). It is in no way difficult to see Trump is a "city slicker", a "New York Playboy" who lives off golden spoon desires and does sex shows, showing women off in beauty pageants, to get attention. Standing next to lavish things and beautiful women gets Trump attention for what he stands next to! This is not difficult to demonstrate across his entire life.

But do you witness people addressing the problem like that? That Donald Trump flashes cash, lives "bling life", with private jets and women he pays to be in television shows on November 8, 2013 in Moscow? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe_2013 Nope. And how November 2013 is [right before February 2014 Ukraine war, normalizing Russia](/Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md) on the Miss Universe attention stage? I see low-effort Reddit comments that don't actually discuss that the audience itself has a problem.

The entire nation needs to face up to the avoidance of Bible verse "1 John 3:17" - it doesn't matter if you believe in science fiction stories. You can learn a quote and apply it to MAGA voters and Trump / Musk values. Is it difficult? no. Is it outside the thinking people are locked into on social sites? yes. Promoting Bible verse "1 John 3:17" is authentic goodness. Which people find repulsive and unattractive since year 2013.

In all the talk about Epstein List, why aren't people discussing January 2009 onward blogging by Malala in Swat Valley, Pakistan and her labor to give girls voices ALL OVER EARTH - and teach girls to network with each other, become stronger, and face up to abusive old men like Taliban leaders? Supporting Malala is addressing the roots of the Epstein List behavior. How much more abuse do you need to see than a girl on a school bus having her and friends shot, in the head, for blogging against old men? How can you possibly not see the need to mention Malala's name as often as people mention Epstein name? Don't let men run all around the world abusing women. It is not a NATIONAL issue, it is a human species evolution of society issue! It is an EDUCATION issue to see this is a problem with girls / women being abused systemically everywhere on Earth!

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1q4zxsn/trump_admin_says_its_cutting_welfare_funds_to/nxwow3r/

Reddit users can't stand up to Russia's invading Reddit. Can't even name the Internet Research Agency and timeline leading up to Trump's election.

Reddit society will find any way to avoid nonfiction books. Blue vs. Red brainrot is all people desire. Simplistic screen games that can fit on tiny-short Reddit comment messages. Trump plays checkers of "Blue bad" and Reddit eats it up with "Red" in the name. The less words, like "outplurbed", the more powerful.

Anything to avoid learning and education of nonfiction. Rick Roderick, Duke University:

"::: the way people deal with this is interesting. They deal with it as a form of complexity, a word I have used probably too many times. It makes the people caught in this cusp between an old world and an old paradigm that is dying and a new one that cannot really yet be born. And we find ourselves in that space. And it draws us to people like Ross Perot who say “It’s just that simple… it’s just that simple… it’s just that simple”. That’s **the most powerful political rhetoric in a world** with a postmodern trajectory. God, how we would love it if someone could tell us anything was “just that simple” :::" - https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

The issue isn't ONE person, it's all the people who think it is funny and amusing and thrilling entertainment. People follow the hate leadership of Trump. Trump leads a nation of mocking. Joe Biden was far too unattractive as a source of humor and jokes for Reddit audiences.

It is impossible to convince Reddit media addicts that the entire nation is media addicts. Nonfiction learning about Surkov information warfare methods is repulsive to addicts. we aren't the only nation in the world. These comparisons of behavior of "high energy Fox News leadership" can be made to previous Presidents like Obama or world leaders in Canada. But Reddit meme consumers will not face that MAGA is driven by mockery and hate, just now as anti-MAGA is motivated.

https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1q56g86/mark_kellys_official_response_to_hegseths_threats/nxxwn26/

Over 10 years and 6 months of never-ending Donald Trump antics politics. Russian information warfare since March 2013 based on Surkov techniques. And the same problem is wrong with the supposed "opposition to Trump" that Trump supporters have. Entertainment addition. Wanting Trump and MAGA and everyone to provide meme behaviors. Neil Postman's 1985 book, Carl Sagan's 1995 book, Rick Roderick's 1993 lectures describe the possibility of this society.

Let me say it again repeating: this isn't a joke. These are actual serious messages from Reddit audience wishing that every single hour of every single day is amusement and entertainment. A Fox News Pentagon leader who triggers responses like this, is the sports mentality the audience is calling for. Never-ending dumb as fuck satire and sarcasm running society into the ground. Meme drunks in never-ending state of chuckles and giggles all the time. That's the unstoppable situaiton we are in, audiences who come to Reddit to give their wealth, power, energy over for more bad-ass copypasta memes.

https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1q56g86/mark_kellys_official_response_to_hegseths_threats/nxy1bwt/

RFK Jr threatens real people. Putin threatens Ukraine. Fox News threatens blue states. Real killers do make threats. Even animals bark and threaten before they kill. Donald Trump has been threatening people for decades and harming real people. It is as if people in USA year 2026 don't grasp how billionaires (Putin, Trump, Murdoch all cited in this paragraph) kill people and use communications right to their face.

These Reddit values of "celebrating violence"... don't teach why. There is no education of morality as to why violence is bad. On Pluribus subreddit, people celebrate mocking intelligent people with "outplurbed" and similar street-gangs of celebrating ignorance. The pro-ignorance Fox News society far dominates the world now. Malala's pro-education didn't win. Only a tiny fraction, say 3 or 5%, of people think intelligent nonfiction learning is desirable. Others want to drown the world in ignorance that leads to violence and health care system diseases and death (another form of violence, economic violence, red tape health insurance papers violence).

Vince Gilligan in his February 15, 2025 speech was spot on.  Social media is a diseased cesspool spreading vector of creating pro-war pro-power MAGA values. Being a pro-Putin Russian to some may seem like just a political choice (Vince Gilligan said in his speech he had two family members die, one pro-Trump pro-Putin killing of Ukraine people)... but that's the problem.

Having family members who drive their car drunk, or elderly people who drive their cars when their body and mind can't keep up... is a REAL WORLD danger. Yet, the attitude of cutting off dialog (which Gilligan is criticizing, I think) doesn't address it. The drunk drivers still drive drunk even if their family members cut them off from their life. News reports of accidents show this! Drug abusers, Walter White meth, don't get addressed. There are people, predators, selling and making these drugs. Walter White lives his normal predatory teaching life. Running education camps on killing and hate.

Not standing up against actual drunk drivers, actual Putin lovers who murder in Ukraine, actual terrorists in Algeria who butcher families... isn't a good thing. It's worshiping meme sites and touch Apple iPhone and iPad devices to a point that you don't grasp how a military boot camp and chain of command military values actually work. Human beings can be raised to be military murders and follow killing orders. Putin has proven that with Ukraine since February 20, 2014. And Putin is FAR FROM the only military organized teacher and killer in the world.

But people can't be bothered to quote nonfiction books and nonfiction articles and learning about real-world terrorism, war, pro-diseases that a cesspool spreads. WikiQuote is one click away.

* "The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind.

Reddit users would never know about Epstein if it were not for media. Did any of the people in Reddit comment section fly on Epstein's jet and witness the girls being abused? I really doubt there are few if any people. What people are reacting to is social media Reddit postings. Photographs of Epstein.

Meme addicts on Reddit are very concerned and care a whole lot about the latest movie memes, sports memes, comic memes, White House memes, Elon Musk memes, Trump golf memes, TV memes, video game memes. The attraction to tiny-short patterns of thinking is short-term short-think.

High speed messaging systems, super fast Reddit comment delivery, instant notification of a reply is what has created Donald Trump fandoms. A celebrity Reality TV star has created a Reality TV White House that people { worship, praise, desire, crave, demand, want, are married to, are loyal to } because it's high speed entertainment. It's meme White House, meme Pentagon, meme military ideals.

Reddit users, Reddit audience, does not want to face reality: Saudi Arabia Mecca isn't nonfiction, it isn't science. It's memes. Mohammad's Quran story is a book of memes. Meme poetry. Popularity of nonfiction. Same with the Roman Empire since year 380, the Christian meme book of Jesus storytelling and Bible. Fiction outsells nonfiction. **The very same attraction Reddit earns money from, meme attraction, is the very same attraction Donald Trump White House / Trump President profits from.** The very same mind / brain / attraction to Reddit memes is the same high-speed content Trump provides. The 5G and 6G promise of high-speed memes. That's the United States of America year 2026. Reality and real is **5G meme delivery** that Trump leads with.

I call it the "Surkov Shuffle" media technique. Adam Curtis, BBC broadcast: NYE year 2014. About Surkov. "Everything we're told by journalists and politicians is confusing and contradictory. Of course, there is no Mr. Surkov in charge, but it is an odd, non-linear world that plays into the hands of those in power."

"title of this course has been “The Self Under Siege”. If I didn’t think it was a real, virulent technological siege and just some thought up philosopher’s dream, which would not have interested me. I mean, I have no interest in that." - Texan Roderick, Duke University, 1993

“That unique Moscow mix of tackiness and menace. One time I see a poster advertising a new property development that captures the tone nicely. Got up in the style of Nazi propaganda, it shows two Germanic-looking youths against a glorious alpine mountain over the slogan "Life is Getting Better". It would be wrong to say the ad is humorous, but it's not quite serious either. It's sort of both. It's saying this is the society we live in (a dictatorship), but we're just playing at it (we can make jokes about it), but playing in a serious way (we're making money playing it and won't let anyone subvert its rules).”

Reddit has been online for over two decades. The Media is Reddit. And these short low-quality messages that can't quote Neil Postman on media ecology, Marshall McLuhan on media ecology... are cover-file for Trumpism junk information addicts.

Downplaying the war against reality, that it's trivial, trivializing the situaiton of Putin's information warfare defeating USA since March 2013.

Yes. The entire population that won't confront media addiction. Neil Postman's 1985 book rotting on the shelf. Last year, year 2025, was the 40th year since a book was published on this crisis of the ENTIRE NATION of image addicts. Time Magazine, a long established news source in USA before Reddit was ever created. Before Twitter was able to be purchased by Elon Musk! Before fiction addictions took over nonfiction learning.
