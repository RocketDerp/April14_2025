A tiny-short Tweet-think message. No link, no author name, no book titles, no quotes. The most up-voted comment on the top of front page of Reddit.

What is avoided in this Reddit society is facing up to the pattern. The medical doctors who work for Trump are not all age 79 dementia and senile. They are age 45 men with medical degrees. And many of them. But Reddit society and Bluesky society fixate on just the President Tony Clifton performances from the leaders.

This is a "seeing the forest for the trees" problem. An inability to organize and see media systems like Fox News HDTV audience and others as thriving off falsehoods. Taking on in an organized sustained way, not one tree at a time, but teaching how people behave in groups. Mob mentality of entire audiences, Reddit audiences, Fox News HDTV audiences.

Trump is a master of crating conflicting paradox information. Surkov students. People get attracted to monomyth paradox story patterns and abandon science thinking in favor of mythology monomyth patterns.

“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! **My god is a little god**, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, [Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space.

People block neighbors on Reddit at the drop of a hat. I get blocked for discussing a television show with peers. Downvoting to silence people. Toxic popularity. People can't even name the Internet Research Agency or Cambridge Analytica on Reddit. People can't name Jen Senko or her film since year 2015 / 2016. But every dumb joke and meme people stuff their minds with while consuming Russian messaging.

The top-voted comment, the most popular message. A laugh-track for Reddit audiences, observe the "LOL" message. Chuckehead mindsets, reset audience brains into meme stupor, amusement-washing serious problems of cults with LOL cult behaviors. Surkov students defeated USA since March 2013 using these techniques.

Conservative vs. liberal is brain-rot. The anti-mythological pro-logic one-bit bi-polar competitive brain programming that everyone parrots on media systems.

Brainwashing, via touch devices, media devices. But these Reddit messages can't quote a nonfiction book or film or name any authors or teachers on "brainwashing". Just low-effort commenting, no concern to organize or stand up and rally around Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 film and book.  Just extremely low-effort commenting is all people desire in their concern to actually address the problem, civic duty.

“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985 book

Look at age of Reddit account. But they have adopted the new Reddit feature. "allowing users to hide posts and comments, in a major update rolled out starting June 3, 2025, giving users fine-grained control over what appears on their profiles". A feature of anti-transparency. Even Twitter last year OPENED account creation visibility https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/rightwing-influencers-outside-us-x-twitter-tool and revealed how many insincere accounts there are. People let rich and powerful and famous actors use real names on social media, but amusement seekers drown everything with no-identity no-citation jokes and memes. ["Celebration of Ignorance"](../Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md), stuffed minds with amusements and jokes.
