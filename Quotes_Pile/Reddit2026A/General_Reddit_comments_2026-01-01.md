A tiny-short Tweet-think message. No link, no author name, no book titles, no quotes. The most up-voted comment on the top of front page of Reddit.

What is avoided in this Reddit society is facing up to the pattern. The medical doctors who work for Trump are not all age 79 dementia and senile. They are age 45 men with medical degrees. And many of them. But Reddit society and Bluesky society fixate on just the President Tony Clifton performances from the leaders.

This is a "seeing the forest for the trees" problem. An inability to organize and see media systems like Fox News HDTV audience and others as thriving off falsehoods. Taking on in an organized sustained way, not one tree at a time, but teaching how people behave in groups. Mob mentality of entire audiences, Reddit audiences, Fox News HDTV audiences.

Trump is a master of crating conflicting paradox information. Surkov students. People get attracted to monomyth paradox story patterns and abandon science thinking in favor of mythology monomyth patterns.

Elon Musk is following the October 7, 1996 onward Rupert Murdoch lead. By creating small mindset patterns that shrink the world away from the over 8 billion minds. By focusing on Elon Musk South Africa white supremacy values, Rupert Murdoch *wealth televangelism, praise the rich* - a combined "Stand Up For the BIG GUY" programming... it makes people seem smarter. It's a small mindset. ... ... ...     

“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say, “No, no, no! **My god is a little god**, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.” ― Carl Sagan, [Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space. Published November 8, 1994. Page 50.](https://books.google.com/books?id=rTCr0H6sRSoC&pg=PA50&dq=%22that+hardly+any+major+religion+has+looked+at+science+and+concluded%22+inauthor:sagan&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

Left vs. right has become brainrot. People can't grasp the Great Seal USA Pluribus meaning, that it requires mythological thinking. Not binary logic of left vs. right, one-bit polarity, bi-polar. ... ... ...     

"What explains the relationship between these symbols and the Masons, and the fact that so many of these founding fathers belonged to the Masonic order? Is the Masonic order an expression somehow of **mythological thinking**?" - Bill Moyers, [The Power of Myth, year 1988 book, page 37](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA37&dq=%22Is+the+Masonic+order+an+expression+somehow+of+mythological+thinking%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

Asserting hate, always hate harder messaging. [Year 2015 book by Ted Koppel spells out the trending situation](../Quotes_Pile/Ted_Koppel.md). Reddit news is trash now since year 2014. People prize and won't create custom headlines that Reddit allows, people stick to the clickbait headlines.

Putin. Just like Reddit has been since March 2013 when the IRA started ramping up. Reddit owners admitted it https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 - but end-users won't organize Wiki or FAQ on serious topics.
