No evidence required!

This is the message that got me banned for "harassment" Glad I preserved it, because the new Reddit owner technique is that even the login of the account can not be shown evidence of the message that caused the ban. Yes, you got that right, the secret police of Reddit ban you from replying to anyone who messages you and does not even provide evidence of your "crime". The message is removed from Reddit to even your own self, the author of the comment. Terrible policy. 

Lucky I pasted a copy here when it was instantly censored by the automated A.I. of Reddit.. You can see the timestamp of saving at time of comment. Before I was band and I can no longer get a copy off Reddit now.

I could see they were trying to corner me, so I put those keywords into the previous message. Because making insulting claims in the name of "this is for your own good" to shut down conversation.

"I'm just a commenter." - that's the loaded gun that they are going report me to Reddit as a harassment. And they reported the message you see below. Calling a person ignorant isn't a hate message. Especially when you back it up with comment about television show audiences from Carl Sagan. 

In the age of RFK Jr and Donald Trump, calling someone "ignorant" is no longer safe. Willful ignorance. It isn't calling someone { stupid, dumb, idiot } - because *Ignorance* can be fixed with learning and education. That's what I always emphasize about Donald Trump. I don't think he is stupid, I think he swims in Fox News HDTV. And I don't think Rupert Murdoch is stupid, Murdoch has found that a certain hate-filled television programming draws very loyal audiences. Jen Senko's film is about that topic. Terrorist mosques and anti-equality clergy find people are very loyal.

IF ANYTHING, people are anti-loyal, repulsed, by the very ideals of "Love All People", the February 28, 1954 equation from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. People have every incentive with Donald trump and Elon Musk on constant attention for the last decade plus to say... hey that quote by MLK Jr what we need now before world war three! And we should be putting that in front of every person in Russia vs. Ukraine! Alas, that is exactly what people avoid doing. Instead, citing the excitement of hate upon Donald Trump and hate upon Twitter audiences, and hate upon people.

* "This simply means that there is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. When we look beneath the surface, beneath the impulsive evil deed, we see within our enemy-neighbor a measure of goodness and know that the viciousness and evilness of his acts are not quite representative of all that he is. We see him in a new light. We recognize that his hate grows out of fear, pride, **ignorance, prejudice, and misunderstanding**" - Martin Luther King Jr.

It is exactly this aggressive misunderstanding and prizing of Trump as a symbol of Ignorance, the thrill people have using Trump as a punching bag - their attract to  throw insults over and over and over every day as a form of entertainment and amusement-washing of Trump. But MAGA society doesn't just do it to Trump, MAGA USA society does it to ANYONE who is suffering. /r/LeopardsAteMyFace social movement of mocking and insulting those injured and mind-fucked by Russia. And I am one of the most mind-fucked by Russia.

But people would rather deny the Internet Research Agency impact on White House, Twitter, Musk, Trump than face up to the patterns of out-group hate in our religions, television networks (Fox News vs. MSNBC), newspapers, and social media cesspools (Vince Gilligan's term).

* "There is little hope for us until we become toughminded enough to break loose from the shackles of prejudice, half-truths, and downright ignorance." - Martin Luther King Jr. this Sunday January 4, 2026.

> I'm just a commenter.

1. A causal dehumanizer

2. Ignorant? Uneducated?

>  I am concerned about you as a fellow human being

You sound very ignorant. A television show and Reddit app has your mind going wild. You seem to think you are playing a video game on a computer machine, Reddit cloud computing, and seem very ignorant of "***"Media Ecology Studies"*** by Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, among others.  You sound pro-ignorance

This is about a television show named "PLURIBUS". Do you know Marshall McLuhan's teachings about television shows and audiences?

You sound like a bully who is anti-diversity, wants to police people who don't follow your rules of messaging in a free democratic society. That you want to cage up and imprison people who dissent or deviate from the hive minded thinking of USA January 2026.

&nbsp;

> your own lil reality 

You seem detached from evidence, facts, truth, science thinking. You present no evidence, facts, you just imagine reality.

You are Jesus believer? Hear god in your magical prayers? Hear voices of Jesus praising you in USA MAGA land January 2026? Trump voices of Jesus?

# Celebration of Ignorance

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, **clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish** between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

# Nation of Suckers

"Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don’t practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us and we risk becoming a nation of suckers" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 38 (page 82?)
