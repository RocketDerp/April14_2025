1. A causal dehumanizer

2. Ignorant? Uneducated?

You sound very ignorant. A television show and Reddit app has your mind going wild. You seem to think you are playing a video game on a computer machine, Reddit cloud computing, and seem very ignorant of "***"Media Ecology Studies"*** by Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, among others.  You sound pro-ignorance

This is about a television show named "PLURIBUS". Do you know Marshall McLuhan's teachings about television shows and audiences?

You sound like a bully who is anti-diversity, wants to police people who don't follow your rules of messaging in a free democratic society. That you want to cage up and imprison people who dissent or deviate from the hive minded thinking of USA January 2026.

&nbsp;

> your own lil reality 

You seem detached from evidence, facts, truth, science thinking. You present no evidence, facts, you just imagine reality.

You are Jesus believer? Hear god in your magical prayers? Hear voices of Jesus praising you in USA MAGA land January 2026? Trump voices of Jesus?

# Celebration of Ignorance

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, **clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish** between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.”

# Nation of Suckers

"Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don’t practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us and we risk becoming a nation of suckers" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 38 (page 82?)
