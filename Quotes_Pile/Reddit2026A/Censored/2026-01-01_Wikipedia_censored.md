I understand that you mocked a Wikipedia link. That you are anti-learning anti-Wikipedia.

You have a **FIXATION** on Reddit users and won't escape Reddit.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States

It is a very common problem with meme addicts here on Reddit. Who won't read paper books, won't look at Wikipedia, etc.

You said it earlier "Sending Wikipedia links", mocking "Checkmate!" at Wikipedia.
