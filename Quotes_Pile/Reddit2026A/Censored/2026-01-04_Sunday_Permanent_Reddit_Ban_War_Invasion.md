Reddit REMOVES my own message even from me, so even I can not be informed exactly what I said that was "harassing".

Clearly this user keeps playing the "go get help", "reddit cares" against me for discussing Pluribus TV show.

Hive mind Reddit mob mentality against the free thinking.

The time of this 11 hours ago from 9:00 am Sunday morning, now... 

* "The news of the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which captured President Nicolás Maduro, broke approximately 19 hours ago."

19 hours minus 11 hours = 8 hours.

The USA Mass Mind / Pluribus mindset of wild war against neighbors was cooking for 8 hours. Reddit hive mind was screaming at everything against unity, Pluribus "We The People" meaning.

I stood my ground.

It isn't considered "bad behavior" on Reddit to call someone mentally sick, a retard, a libtard, mentally ill for discussing a TV show in a way that offers intepretatons from James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan.

It is RFK Jr Mob Mentality. Even people who DISLIKE Trump and RFK Jr do not see what Marshall McLuhan is saying about WHY Elon Musk and Trump are leading the world with Twitter and Truth Social and all the Jimmy Kimell / Stephen Colbert / 60 minutes canceling.

It's a game people play: "Go get help, go see a doctor" you talked about a TV show in a spiritual and religions way! Just like people do with Bible book and Quran book which are also science fiction story.

All religions are bad when you can't translate religion to religion.

I am not anti-Bible or anti-Quran, I'm anti clergy and the way they TEACH it. As superior to any other science fiction story.

Yes, some stories are better, but convincing people that it is nonfiction is a crime. And nobody is confused about Pluriubs and Carol being nonfiction. But that's the whole attraction to the show. The Fiction within the Fiction. The Play within the Play. The Pirate story within the 8 billion people virus story. Fiction within Fiction.

These people who use Reddit to hang out and instantly comment reply about Pluribus show... don't want me to see a doctor, they want me silenced. It's mob mentality. And they block you, mock you, tell you to go see a doctor

# Drinking yesterday, Saturday holiday weekned

A show about boozer Carol, and Reddit users never once suggest: are you drinking beer on a holiday wekeend, New Years 4 day holdiay?

They tell you to go seek emergency doctors.

Here's the pattern, typical:

I tend to make even MORE typos and mistakes (copy/paste wrong things, etc) when drinking / under the influence of computer alcohol... 

So I do see an edit indicator within 1 hour of the 12 hour ago comment. Does Reddit give exact time on edits?

>  a mental health crisis and you should seek assistance.

> without the intervention of a medical professional.

Why are you on a television show subreddit saying shit like this?

You sound ignorant, anti-American, anti Free Masons, anti Free Thinkers.

What is the basis of your message?

I think you hate **Free Speech** and are here to manipulate people into silence. Chilling effect.
