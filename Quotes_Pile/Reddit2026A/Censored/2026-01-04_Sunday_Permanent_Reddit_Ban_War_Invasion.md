The war invasion.

Reddit REMOVES my own message even from me, so even I can not be informed exactly what I said that was "harassing".

Clearly this user keeps playing the "go get help", "reddit cares" against me for discussing Pluribus TV show.

Hive mind Reddit mob mentality against the free thinking.

The time of this 11 hours ago from 9:00 am Sunday morning, now... 

* "The news of the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which captured President Nicolás Maduro, broke approximately 19 hours ago."

19 hours minus 11 hours = 8 hours.

The USA Mass Mind / Pluribus mindset of wild war against neighbors was cooking for 8 hours. Reddit hive mind was screaming at everything against unity, Pluribus "We The People" meaning.

I stood my ground.

It isn't considered "bad behavior" on Reddit to call someone mentally sick, a retard, a libtard, mentally ill for discussing a TV show in a way that offers intepretatons from James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan.

It is RFK Jr Mob Mentality. Even people who DISLIKE Trump and RFK Jr do not see what Marshall McLuhan is saying about WHY Elon Musk and Trump are leading the world with Twitter and Truth Social and all the Jimmy Kimell / Stephen Colbert / 60 minutes canceling.

It's a game people play: "Go get help, go see a doctor" you talked about a TV show in a spiritual and religions way! Just like people do with Bible book and Quran book which are also science fiction story.

All religions are bad when you can't translate religion to religion.

I am not anti-Bible or anti-Quran, I'm anti clergy and the way they TEACH it. As superior to any other science fiction story.

Yes, some stories are better, but convincing people that it is nonfiction is a crime. And nobody is confused about Pluriubs and Carol being nonfiction. But that's the whole attraction to the show. The Fiction within the Fiction. The Play within the Play. The Pirate story within the 8 billion people virus story. Fiction within Fiction.

These people who use Reddit to hang out and instantly comment reply about Pluribus show... don't want me to see a doctor, they want me silenced. It's mob mentality. And they block you, mock you, tell you to go see a doctor

I am the only honest fucking person here that trump is driving ME CRAZY. I have known since i telephoned the pentagon!

Look at the god damn dates!

1. June 16, 2015 Trump

2. August 17, 2015 I called the pentagon, first time in my entire life

# Drinking yesterday, Saturday holiday weekned

A show about boozer Carol, and Reddit users never once suggest: are you drinking beer on a holiday wekeend, New Years 4 day holdiay?

They tell you to go seek emergency doctors.

Here's the pattern, typical:

I tend to make even MORE typos and mistakes (copy/paste wrong things, etc) when drinking / under the influence of computer alcohol... 

So I do see an edit indicator within 1 hour of the 12 hour ago comment. Does Reddit give exact time on edits?

>  a mental health crisis and you should seek assistance.

> without the intervention of a medical professional.

Why are you on a television show subreddit saying shit like this?

You sound ignorant, anti-American, anti Free Masons, anti Free Thinkers.

What is the basis of your message?

I think you hate **Free Speech** and are here to manipulate people into silence. Chilling effect.

this is the way the information warfare game plays.

1. You ask for exact quotes of what disturbs the person so badly

2. They do not provide any quotes or specific, vague and non-specific gaslight of what is so alarming and disturbing.

In my experience and witness and study: This is often how Muslims Christians behave towards homosexual. Some implied "crime" that they won't describe. Some alarming disturbing thing that a person has done t that they won't articulate. You can see this in the fandom of shows, like Pluribus, with lesbians.

> Yeah, OP, this is just an observable fact.

Exactly WHAT? Quote it, be precise, stop gaslighting me because you are in Reddit hive mind!

That you appear to be exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis and you should seek assistance.

It's okay! There's nothing wrong with having a crisis any more than there's something wrong with stepping on a nail. It's just that it's a problem that is unlikely to get better without the intervention of a medical professional.

* that's the game. "it is fact", "i can see fact" - I can see into your brain "fact" in a TV show community about a hive mind seeing into each other's brain.

* Is anyone being threatened? Is self-harm threatened? no. Just disturbing world peace ideas and concepts being discuss. The idea of equality, universal love, compassion for all mankind. That's what disturbs competitive people who live in Donald Trump 2026 egoism / egomania Musk internet culture. To question egoism, to BE attracted to the show because of the Great Seal of the United States of America progressive 13 step thinking system - seems insane to people who thin a war 7 hours earlier is not impacting the minds of the entire planet via news reporting systems! World war is being sparked by people who prize greed and power, oil and attention seeking. Anti-goodness, anti-health care

* This person very well knows the medical system in USA is a insurance money nightmare. And it is a holiday weekend when services are taxed. By invoking "medical" they are trying to shove you into Donald Trump RFK Jr help plan. It is all non-specific stress attacks, to try to find your weak points as an American and manipulate them. I even called out manipulated, which you can see the word repeated in the reply.

* there is no **medical treatment from a doctor because Donald Trump is invading Venezuela** and causing anxiety! The fact so many people are avoiding the spiritual topics of the TV show, the spiritual meaning of "Pluribus" just adds t the MAGA USA 2026 reality. USA wasn't like this at all in 2013, nor was Reddit society like this in conversations.

* "very silly" that I protest that I am feeling that the direct cause of my emotional distress is being manipulated and gaslight by a Reddit user. **"very silly"** that I say they are manipulating and fixating on me. And indeed, they got me banned! They manipulated the owners of Reddit into banning me, and I said they were manipulating the situation! I've been in social media since 1983, I know when manipulation is intending to incite a riot against an individual on the day a nation is waging a senseless invasion against Venezuela and how this impacts group-think / Marshall McLuhan "Mass Man"

      * "The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own." - [Marshall McLuhan. This is the VERY TOPIC of PLUR1BUS](/June10_2025/The_Egoism_Walls_Ego_Barriers.md). Not being predatory towards those you sense are weak and "very silly" them into a corner for being *deviants* sexually or intellectually! thinking outside the bog disturbing the group mindset of war fandom, cheering on an invasion of a nation on that day!

* "There's nothing wrong with having a crisis any more than there's something wrong with stepping on a nail." Oh, what a message, **normalize anything** with that 1-bit logic. Step on nails, is' ok. Donald Trump is invading Venezuela and putting people in the hospital for no good reason, that's just something we should all not have any emotions or reaction to! ""There's nothing wrong with having a crisis" o October 7, 2023 Muslims who can't read the Quran, a science fiction story, properly and people who are MAGA who can't read Fox News HDTV as fiction properly.... yha "There's nothing wrong with having a crisis" with the celebration of Jinadi invasion of Israel on October 7 morning and killing 1,200 people! Or world leaders invading other nations with no serious effort of diplomacy or even interest in anything *goodness*. Don't be disturbed with how USA people are prizing war and on a warpath and doing everything they can to not grasp teaching of the Great Seal of the United States of America ideals of world peace and unity. No, wage war, cheer it on, don't be upset / disturbed / alarmed / or behave in any way with desires for the Founding Fathers symbolism to be understood as they were intended!

* If Reddit society wouldn't shut me down with false reports even more for being "crazy" because Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch and Putin are driving EVERYONE crazy, I'm just more open and honest about the situaiton! I would post this on EVERY comment in Pluribus of mine. But they would call it spam or something else to AVOID the context of where I am coming from and how serious I am about this show's topic of Latin word Pluribus borrowed from the Founding Fathers of the USA.
     *  ::::=== "the entire philosophy the early republic was based upon. And how utterly deplorable and regrettable and terrible it is that all of this has been virtually totally forgotten by our days. And that we have held, The American People, have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others... One of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away. And how incredibly unfortunate and terrible this is." https://youtu.be/08R1kPdfrHA?t=4427 - Dr. Stephan A. Hoeller (immigrant to USA), 1987 ===:::

There is no audience. Neil Postman's books rot on the shelf. And when people do read them, they describe the book like a movie rating. They do not connect Neil Postman's writing with the very force of MAGA USA, Rupert Murdoch Fox News audience, Elon Musk Twitter audience, etc.

People do not call to "make the USA think like Carl Sagan 1995 book again"... I do! But I do not see it. I see hate for hate, mock for mock, hate vs. hate, mock vs. mock, a contest of *race to the bottom* of more hate, mocking, and machine dehumanization (blocking, banning), more deport-others, self-deport, chilling effect. I even mentioned chilling effect as my last message before being silenced on Reddit.
