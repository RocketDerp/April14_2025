# 2026-01-04 Sunday Permanent Ban from Reddit

The war invasion. 

This message got me banned

<img width="1766" height="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f308ea31-23bd-4955-ac76-c16c861be1e7" />

Reddit REMOVES my own message even from me, so even I can not be informed exactly what I said that was "harassing".

Clearly this user keeps playing the "go get help", "reddit cares" against me for discussing Pluribus TV show.

Hive mind Reddit mob mentality against the free thinking.

The time of this 11 hours ago from 9:00 am Sunday morning, now... 

* "The news of the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which captured President Nicolás Maduro, broke approximately 19 hours ago."

19 hours minus 11 hours = 8 hours.

The USA Mass Mind / Pluribus mindset of wild war against neighbors was cooking for 8 hours. Reddit hive mind was screaming at everything against unity, Pluribus "We The People" meaning.

I stood my ground.

It isn't considered "bad behavior" on Reddit to call someone mentally sick, a retard, a libtard, mentally ill for discussing a TV show in a way that offers intepretatons from James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan.

It is RFK Jr Mob Mentality. Even people who DISLIKE Trump and RFK Jr do not see what Marshall McLuhan is saying about WHY Elon Musk and Trump are leading the world with Twitter and Truth Social and all the Jimmy Kimell / Stephen Colbert / 60 minutes canceling.

It's a game people play: "Go get help, go see a doctor" you talked about a TV show in a spiritual and religions way! Just like people do with Bible book and Quran book which are also science fiction story.

All religions are bad when you can't translate religion to religion.

I am not anti-Bible or anti-Quran, I'm anti clergy and the way they TEACH it. As superior to any other science fiction story.

Yes, some stories are better, but convincing people that it is nonfiction is a crime. And nobody is confused about Pluriubs and Carol being nonfiction. But that's the whole attraction to the show. The Fiction within the Fiction. The Play within the Play. The Pirate story within the 8 billion people virus story. Fiction within Fiction.

These people who use Reddit to hang out and instantly comment reply about Pluribus show... don't want me to see a doctor, they want me silenced. It's mob mentality. And they block you, mock you, tell you to go see a doctor

I am the only honest fucking person here that trump is driving ME CRAZY. I have known since i telephoned the pentagon!

Look at the god damn dates!

1. June 16, 2015 Trump

2. August 17, 2015 I called the pentagon, first time in my entire life

# Drinking yesterday, Saturday holiday weekned

A show about boozer Carol, and Reddit users never once suggest: are you drinking beer on a holiday wekeend, New Years 4 day holdiay?

They tell you to go seek emergency doctors.

Here's the pattern, typical:

<img width="1744" height="1494" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/835672f7-8830-4bc4-92be-7c32e9efed34" />

I tend to make even MORE typos and mistakes (copy/paste wrong things, etc) when drinking / under the influence of computer alcohol... 

So I do see an edit indicator within 1 hour of the 12 hour ago comment. Does Reddit give exact time on edits?

>  a mental health crisis and you should seek assistance.

> without the intervention of a medical professional.

Why are you on a television show subreddit saying shit like this?

You sound ignorant, anti-American, anti Free Masons, anti Free Thinkers.

What is the basis of your message?

I think you hate **Free Speech** and are here to manipulate people into silence. Chilling effect.

this is the way the information warfare game plays.

1. You ask for exact quotes of what disturbs the person so badly

2. They do not provide any quotes or specific, vague and non-specific gaslight of what is so alarming and disturbing.

In my experience and witness and study: This is often how Muslims Christians behave towards homosexual. Some implied "crime" that they won't describe. Some alarming disturbing thing that a person has done t that they won't articulate. You can see this in the fandom of shows, like Pluribus, with lesbians.

> Yeah, OP, this is just an observable fact.

Exactly WHAT? Quote it, be precise, stop gaslighting me because you are in Reddit hive mind!

That you appear to be exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis and you should seek assistance.

It's okay! There's nothing wrong with having a crisis any more than there's something wrong with stepping on a nail. It's just that it's a problem that is unlikely to get better without the intervention of a medical professional.

* that's the game. "it is fact", "i can see fact" - I can see into your brain "fact" in a TV show community about a hive mind seeing into each other's brain.

* Is anyone being threatened? Is self-harm threatened? no. Just disturbing world peace ideas and concepts being discuss. The idea of equality, universal love, compassion for all mankind. That's what disturbs competitive people who live in Donald Trump 2026 egoism / egomania Musk internet culture. To question egoism, to BE attracted to the show because of the Great Seal of the United States of America progressive 13 step thinking system - seems insane to people who thin a war 7 hours earlier is not impacting the minds of the entire planet via news reporting systems! World war is being sparked by people who prize greed and power, oil and attention seeking. Anti-goodness, anti-health care

* This person very well knows the medical system in USA is a insurance money nightmare. And it is a holiday weekend when services are taxed. By invoking "medical" they are trying to shove you into Donald Trump RFK Jr help plan. It is all non-specific stress attacks, to try to find your weak points as an American and manipulate them. I even called out manipulated, which you can see the word repeated in the reply.

* there is no **medical treatment from a doctor because Donald Trump is invading Venezuela** and causing anxiety! The fact so many people are avoiding the spiritual topics of the TV show, the spiritual meaning of "Pluribus" just adds t the MAGA USA 2026 reality. USA wasn't like this at all in 2013, nor was Reddit society like this in conversations.

* "very silly" that I protest that I am feeling that the direct cause of my emotional distress is being manipulated and gaslight by a Reddit user. **"very silly"** that I say they are manipulating and fixating on me. And indeed, they got me banned! They manipulated the owners of Reddit into banning me, and I said they were manipulating the situation! I've been in social media since 1983, I know when manipulation is intending to incite a riot against an individual on the day a nation is waging a senseless invasion against Venezuela and how this impacts group-think / Marshall McLuhan "Mass Man"
    * "The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own." - [Marshall McLuhan. This is the VERY TOPIC of PLUR1BUS](/June10_2025/The_Egoism_Walls_Ego_Barriers.md). Not being predatory towards those you sense are weak and "very silly" them into a corner for being *deviants* sexually or intellectually! thinking outside the bog disturbing the group mindset of war fandom, cheering on an invasion of a nation on that day!

* "There's nothing wrong with having a crisis any more than there's something wrong with stepping on a nail." Oh, what a message, **normalize anything** with that 1-bit logic. Step on nails, is' ok. Donald Trump is invading Venezuela and putting people in the hospital for no good reason, that's just something we should all not have any emotions or reaction to! ""There's nothing wrong with having a crisis" o October 7, 2023 Muslims who can't read the Quran, a science fiction story, properly and people who are MAGA who can't read Fox News HDTV as fiction properly.... yha "There's nothing wrong with having a crisis" with the celebration of Jinadi invasion of Israel on October 7 morning and killing 1,200 people! Or world leaders invading other nations with no serious effort of diplomacy or even interest in anything *goodness*. Don't be disturbed with how USA people are prizing war and on a warpath and doing everything they can to not grasp teaching of the Great Seal of the United States of America ideals of world peace and unity. No, wage war, cheer it on, don't be upset / disturbed / alarmed / or behave in any way with desires for the Founding Fathers symbolism to be understood as they were intended!

* If Reddit society wouldn't shut me down with false reports even more for being "crazy" because Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch and Putin are driving EVERYONE crazy, I'm just more open and honest about the situaiton! I would post this on EVERY comment in Pluribus of mine. But they would call it spam or something else to AVOID the context of where I am coming from and how serious I am about this show's topic of Latin word Pluribus borrowed from the Founding Fathers of the USA.
     *  ::::=== "the entire philosophy the early republic was based upon. And how utterly deplorable and regrettable and terrible it is that all of this has been virtually totally forgotten by our days. And that we have held, The American People, have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others... One of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away. And how incredibly unfortunate and terrible this is." https://youtu.be/08R1kPdfrHA?t=4427 - Dr. Stephan A. Hoeller (immigrant to USA), 1987 ===:::

There is no audience. Neil Postman's books rot on the shelf. And when people do read them, they describe the book like a movie rating. They do not connect Neil Postman's writing with the very force of MAGA USA, Rupert Murdoch Fox News audience, Elon Musk Twitter audience, etc.

People do not call to "make the USA think like Carl Sagan 1995 book again"... I do! But I do not see it. I see hate for hate, mock for mock, hate vs. hate, mock vs. mock, a contest of *race to the bottom* of more hate, mocking, and machine dehumanization (blocking, banning), more deport-others, self-deport, chilling effect. I even mentioned chilling effect as my last message before being silenced on Reddit.

# Reddit cesspool

You are not allowed to be "unwell"     
The Reddit media enviornment is toxic, and act like toxic is normal    
The Reddit media environment is dehumanizing, and act like that's OK and "well"    

Vince Gilligan February 15, 2025 called social media a cesspoool. And Reddit is part of the worst of it, so is Twitter and Facebook. 

Being unwell on the day Trump is waging war on a nation because of his toxic mindsets and Fox News HDTV consumption...

Seems like incoherent rambling... think he is speaking about overstressed moderators. I'm not exactly sure.

Edited spelling 

...

They say my writing is "incoherent" without citing one single word or quote of what they need help with understanding. Typical gaslighting and bullying tactic. "Your mom buys you ugly clothes", "you shirt isn't new and the latest fashion", "you are age 56 and you don't speak Fox News Language property", "you don't write in cool exiting ways like Donald Trump thrills us on social media", it is all *corner the little guy who is showing weakness* mob mentality.

> Seems like incoherent rambling

Can you be specific and precise what you don't comprehend, grasp, understand? Is English your first language? Do you regularly have understanding issues?

Edited spelling

Language difficulties?

* what if I am incoherently rambling. What if that is all the language I can do with brain damage? Why are you bullying me for it?
* The dog whistle of "send him to a RFK Jr autism camp" is all over Reddit towards me.
* "Wellness farms" https://nursingclio.org/2025/05/08/rfks-ideas-about-wellness-farms-for-young-people-are-eugenic-and-unconstitutional/ - that is year 2025, that is the world I live in, of Reddit society values. USA California Reddit. USA ABQ Pluribus TV show with Carol! that is the hive mind pressure I am under! That is REALITY. Not denial of reality. It has been **trending** since year 2013. Mass dehumanization and **worship billionaires**, anti-individual (poor people),  values.

What people want is what they get. To silence outsiders, deviants, homosexuals, women, to drive people crazy enough they just leave Reddit.  They are non-specific...

# Everyday People Programmed

On every media site, programmed since year 2014 to bully, seek out "libtard" weaknes messages, any kind of emotions, financial, weakness and corner people and gang up with mob mentality.

To silence non-believers in Putin and Trump. In 2014, Putin was the richest man in the entire world who made is own laws, no restrictions on his domestic power! And he invaded Reddit, and altered behaviors to turn people into predators. even if they vote against Trump, hate Trump, hate itself distorts their mind. They Attack AMERICANS, they attack MAGA people with /r/LeopardsAteMyFace - and on Pluribus show, the idea of free  masons or founding fathers origins gets driven off.

* "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion." "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds. "Those kinds of tactics are meant to stop democratic debate, and they work." - **year 2014** https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/

# On topic of the show

People are talking about me, but when I bring up the "hive mind" metaphors of the show and apply it to Reddit, they don't get the connection of the show being about the real USA nation values, concepts, ideas.

This is in the thread about me being "unwell", that this person replied to. I didn't just message them out of the blue, they were in the "unwell" tree of messages.

<img width="1503" height="1404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b5e65a9-5af6-46b7-a55d-6e53abbf0472" />

* "Wake up man, free thinking, free society, free masons is what USA is about. Stop seeking Reddit hive mind permission!"

The Reddit hive mind is telling me to use USA medical system because I am "unwell" because RFK Jr and Donald Trump are the most popular people. Hate of Trump is popular. His every power is hate.

Hate itself has made me unwell since June 15, 2015 (Trump became center of society attention and people marveled at the entertainment and anti-goodness Trump originates) and I called the Pentagon in August 17, 2015. All hate is bad, and my hyper-empathy has been pummeled by the mob mentality of people thinking team sports, find a weak person, defeat them with banning / blocking / deportation. Instead of helping immigrants with the legal paperwork in USA, it's an aggressive mocking and "treatment" system. And people on Reddit can't see that gong to RFK Jr controlled "mental health" is just as toxic. I do not get a thrill from MAGA USA nation. Not just MAGA, but the people who *seek* hate on Reddit to mock and hate MAGA. All hate is toxic to me, swimming in a toxic cesspool of social media like Vince Gilligan described February 15, 2025 at his writers guild speech. 

I don't want to hate MAGA, I don't want to hate Putin, I don't want to hate Trump, I don't want to hate my self as a human on planet Earth. I want Pale Blue Dot Pride and I believe, it is my faith, that we the people must address hate itself and end hate. Not waiting of a magical Kepler 22B signal or Eden signal of science fiction story to *fix it for us* from outside Earth. We The People, All of Us, Pluribus - must work hard and hammer past the egoism to recognize the programming since year 2014 [Year 2014 description: Our Programmable Minds](/Art/ScreenPlay/Our_Programmable_Minds/Year_2014_Description.md) that has wrecked the USA and beyond. The poisoning of the Great Seal of the Untied States of America messages, including Latin word "PLURIBUS".

# One person took stress seriously

I was standing up to the hive mind, like Carol. And one person actually responded and didn't pile on with the mob mentality.

My message was pretty clear about how cesspool and toxic Reddit social media was:    

> Okkkk I'm a little confused as to what you're saying. 

I'm getting all these "medical doctors" on Reddit who keep badgering me when I talk about Carol, Helen, Vince Gilligan, ABQ, Pirate Lady, a fiction television show meaning and ideas.

I posted a message of a **medical doctor"* message I got on Reddit. Is this what people do on 4-day holiday weekends, Saturday Nigh in USA 2026?
