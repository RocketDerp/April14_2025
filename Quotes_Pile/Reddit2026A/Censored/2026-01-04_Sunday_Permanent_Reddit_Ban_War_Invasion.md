# 2026-01-04 Sunday Permanent Ban from Reddit

The war invasion. 

This message got me banned

<img width="1766" height="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f308ea31-23bd-4955-ac76-c16c861be1e7" />

Reddit REMOVES my own message even from me, so even I can not be informed exactly what I said that was "harassing".

Clearly this user keeps playing the "go get help", "reddit cares" against me for discussing Pluribus TV show.

Hive mind Reddit mob mentality against the free thinking.

The time of this 11 hours ago from 9:00 am Sunday morning, now... 

* "The news of the U.S. military operation in Venezuela, which captured President Nicolás Maduro, broke approximately 19 hours ago."

19 hours minus 11 hours = 8 hours.

The USA Mass Mind / Pluribus mindset of wild war against neighbors was cooking for 8 hours. Reddit hive mind was screaming at everything against unity, Pluribus "We The People" meaning.

I stood my ground.

It isn't considered "bad behavior" on Reddit to call someone mentally sick, a retard, a libtard, mentally ill for discussing a TV show in a way that offers intepretatons from James Joyce, Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan.

It is RFK Jr Mob Mentality. Even people who DISLIKE Trump and RFK Jr do not see what Marshall McLuhan is saying about WHY Elon Musk and Trump are leading the world with Twitter and Truth Social and all the Jimmy Kimell / Stephen Colbert / 60 minutes canceling.

It's a game people play: "Go get help, go see a doctor" you talked about a TV show in a spiritual and religions way! Just like people do with Bible book and Quran book which are also science fiction story.

All religions are bad when you can't translate religion to religion.

I am not anti-Bible or anti-Quran, I'm anti clergy and the way they TEACH it. As superior to any other science fiction story.

Yes, some stories are better, but convincing people that it is nonfiction is a crime. And nobody is confused about Pluriubs and Carol being nonfiction. But that's the whole attraction to the show. The Fiction within the Fiction. The Play within the Play. The Pirate story within the 8 billion people virus story. Fiction within Fiction.

These people who use Reddit to hang out and instantly comment reply about Pluribus show... don't want me to see a doctor, they want me silenced. It's mob mentality. And they block you, mock you, tell you to go see a doctor

I am the only honest fucking person here that trump is driving ME CRAZY. I have known since i telephoned the pentagon!

Look at the god damn dates!

1. June 16, 2015 Trump

2. August 17, 2015 I called the pentagon, first time in my entire life

# Drinking yesterday, Saturday holiday weekned

A show about boozer Carol, and Reddit users never once suggest: are you drinking beer on a holiday wekeend, New Years 4 day holdiay?

They tell you to go seek emergency doctors.

Here's the pattern, typical:

<img width="1744" height="1494" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/835672f7-8830-4bc4-92be-7c32e9efed34" />

I tend to make even MORE typos and mistakes (copy/paste wrong things, etc) when drinking / under the influence of computer alcohol... 

So I do see an edit indicator within 1 hour of the 12 hour ago comment. Does Reddit give exact time on edits?

Why are you on a television show subreddit saying shit like this?

You sound ignorant, anti-American, anti Free Masons, anti Free Thinkers.

What is the basis of your message?

I think you hate **Free Speech** and are here to manipulate people into silence. Chilling effect.

1. You ask for exact quotes of what disturbs the person so badly

2. They do not provide any quotes or specific, vague and non-specific gaslight of what is so alarming and disturbing.

In my experience and witness and study: This is often how Muslims Christians behave towards homosexual. Some implied "crime" that they won't describe. Some alarming disturbing thing that a person has done t that they won't articulate. You can see this in the fandom of shows, like Pluribus, with lesbians.

That you appear to be exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis and you should seek assistance.

It's okay! There's nothing wrong with having a crisis any more than there's something wrong with stepping on a nail. It's just that it's a problem that is unlikely to get better without the intervention of a medical professional.

* that's the game. "it is fact", "i can see fact" - I can see into your brain "fact" in a TV show community about a hive mind seeing into each other's brain.

* Is anyone being threatened? Is self-harm threatened? no. Just disturbing world peace ideas and concepts being discuss. The idea of equality, universal love, compassion for all mankind. That's what disturbs competitive people who live in Donald Trump 2026 egoism / egomania Musk internet culture. To question egoism, to BE attracted to the show because of the Great Seal of the United States of America progressive 13 step thinking system - seems insane to people who thin a war 7 hours earlier is not impacting the minds of the entire planet via news reporting systems! World war is being sparked by people who prize greed and power, oil and attention seeking. Anti-goodness, anti-health care

* This person very well knows the medical system in USA is a insurance money nightmare. And it is a holiday weekend when services are taxed. By invoking "medical" they are trying to shove you into Donald Trump RFK Jr help plan. It is all non-specific stress attacks, to try to find your weak points as an American and manipulate them. I even called out manipulated, which you can see the word repeated in the reply.

* there is no **medical treatment from a doctor because Donald Trump is invading Venezuela** and causing anxiety! The fact so many people are avoiding the spiritual topics of the TV show, the spiritual meaning of "Pluribus" just adds t the MAGA USA 2026 reality. USA wasn't like this at all in 2013, nor was Reddit society like this in conversations.

* "very silly" that I protest that I am feeling that the direct cause of my emotional distress is being manipulated and gaslight by a Reddit user. **"very silly"** that I say they are manipulating and fixating on me. And indeed, they got me banned! They manipulated the owners of Reddit into banning me, and I said they were manipulating the situation! I've been in social media since 1983, I know when manipulation is intending to incite a riot against an individual on the day a nation is waging a senseless invasion against Venezuela and how this impacts group-think / Marshall McLuhan "Mass Man"
    * "The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own." - [Marshall McLuhan. This is the VERY TOPIC of PLUR1BUS](/June10_2025/The_Egoism_Walls_Ego_Barriers.md). Not being predatory towards those you sense are weak and "very silly" them into a corner for being *deviants* sexually or intellectually! thinking outside the bog disturbing the group mindset of war fandom, cheering on an invasion of a nation on that day!

* "There's nothing wrong with having a crisis any more than there's something wrong with stepping on a nail." Oh, what a message, **normalize anything** with that 1-bit logic. Step on nails, is' ok. Donald Trump is invading Venezuela and putting people in the hospital for no good reason, that's just something we should all not have any emotions or reaction to! ""There's nothing wrong with having a crisis" o October 7, 2023 Muslims who can't read the Quran, a science fiction story, properly and people who are MAGA who can't read Fox News HDTV as fiction properly.... yha "There's nothing wrong with having a crisis" with the celebration of Jinadi invasion of Israel on October 7 morning and killing 1,200 people! Or world leaders invading other nations with no serious effort of diplomacy or even interest in anything *goodness*. Don't be disturbed with how USA people are prizing war and on a warpath and doing everything they can to not grasp teaching of the Great Seal of the United States of America ideals of world peace and unity. No, wage war, cheer it on, don't be upset / disturbed / alarmed / or behave in any way with desires for the Founding Fathers symbolism to be understood as they were intended!

* If Reddit society wouldn't shut me down with false reports even more for being "crazy" because Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch and Putin are driving EVERYONE crazy, I'm just more open and honest about the situaiton! I would post this on EVERY comment in Pluribus of mine. But they would call it spam or something else to AVOID the context of where I am coming from and how serious I am about this show's topic of Latin word Pluribus borrowed from the Founding Fathers of the USA.
     *  ::::=== "the entire philosophy the early republic was based upon. And how utterly deplorable and regrettable and terrible it is that all of this has been virtually totally forgotten by our days. And that we have held, The American People, have held in their very hands, handed to them by people like Franklin and Jefferson and all kinds of others... One of the most splendid treasures of spiritual philosophy - applicable to all manner of human purposes. And we have discarded it. And we are running around like beggars, the world over, picking up crumbs from every kind of anarchists, Marxists, this thing, fascists, this thing that thing, all over the world. All of which, put together, could never come close to the psychological spiritual wisdom that was given to us to begin with... and that we have simply forgotten about and thrown away.

There is no audience. Neil Postman's books rot on the shelf. And when people do read them, they describe the book like a movie rating. They do not connect Neil Postman's writing with the very force of MAGA USA, Rupert Murdoch Fox News audience, Elon Musk Twitter audience, etc.

People do not call to "make the USA think like Carl Sagan 1995 book again"... I do! But I do not see it. I see hate for hate, mock for mock, hate vs. hate, mock vs. mock, a contest of *race to the bottom* of more hate, mocking, and machine dehumanization (blocking, banning), more deport-others, self-deport, chilling effect. I even mentioned chilling effect as my last message before being silenced on Reddit.

# Reddit cesspool

You are not allowed to be "unwell"     
The Reddit media enviornment is toxic, and act like toxic is normal    
The Reddit media environment is dehumanizing, and act like that's OK and "well"    

Vince Gilligan February 15, 2025 called social media a cesspoool. And Reddit is part of the worst of it, so is Twitter and Facebook. 

Being unwell on the day Trump is waging war on a nation because of his toxic mindsets and Fox News HDTV consumption...

Seems like incoherent rambling... think he is speaking about overstressed moderators. I'm not exactly sure.

Edited spelling 

...

They say my writing is "incoherent" without citing one single word or quote of what they need help with understanding. Typical gaslighting and bullying tactic. "Your mom buys you ugly clothes", "you shirt isn't new and the latest fashion", "you are age 56 and you don't speak Fox News Language property", "you don't write in cool exiting ways like Donald Trump thrills us on social media", it is all *corner the little guy who is showing weakness* mob mentality.

* what if I am incoherently rambling. What if that is all the language I can do with brain damage? Why are you bullying me for it?
* The dog whistle of "send him to a RFK Jr autism camp" is all over Reddit towards me.
* "Wellness farms" https://nursingclio.org/2025/05/08/rfks-ideas-about-wellness-farms-for-young-people-are-eugenic-and-unconstitutional/ - that is year 2025, that is the world I live in, of Reddit society values. USA California Reddit. USA ABQ Pluribus TV show with Carol! that is the hive mind pressure I am under! That is REALITY. Not denial of reality. It has been **trending** since year 2013. Mass dehumanization and **worship billionaires**, anti-individual (poor people),  values.

What people want is what they get. To silence outsiders, deviants, homosexuals, women, to drive people crazy enough they just leave Reddit.  They are non-specific...

# Everyday People Programmed

On every media site, programmed since year 2014 to bully, seek out "libtard" weaknes messages, any kind of emotions, financial, weakness and corner people and gang up with mob mentality.

To silence non-believers in Putin and Trump. In 2014, Putin was the richest man in the entire world who made is own laws, no restrictions on his domestic power! And he invaded Reddit, and altered behaviors to turn people into predators. even if they vote against Trump, hate Trump, hate itself distorts their mind. They Attack AMERICANS, they attack MAGA people with /r/LeopardsAteMyFace - and on Pluribus show, the idea of free  masons or founding fathers origins gets driven off.

* "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion." "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds. "Those kinds of tactics are meant to stop democratic debate, and they work." - **year 2014** https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/

# On topic of the show

People are talking about me, but when I bring up the "hive mind" metaphors of the show and apply it to Reddit, they don't get the connection of the show being about the real USA nation values, concepts, ideas.

This is in the thread about me being "unwell", that this person replied to. I didn't just message them out of the blue, they were in the "unwell" tree of messages.

<img width="1503" height="1404" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b5e65a9-5af6-46b7-a55d-6e53abbf0472" />

* "Wake up man, free thinking, free society, free masons is what USA is about. Stop seeking Reddit hive mind permission!"

The Reddit hive mind is telling me to use USA medical system because I am "unwell" because RFK Jr and Donald Trump are the most popular people. Hate of Trump is popular. His every power is hate.

Hate itself has made me unwell since June 15, 2015 (Trump became center of society attention and people marveled at the entertainment and anti-goodness Trump originates) and I called the Pentagon in August 17, 2015. All hate is bad, and my hyper-empathy has been pummeled by the mob mentality of people thinking team sports, find a weak person, defeat them with banning / blocking / deportation. Instead of helping immigrants with the legal paperwork in USA, it's an aggressive mocking and "treatment" system. And people on Reddit can't see that gong to RFK Jr controlled "mental health" is just as toxic. I do not get a thrill from MAGA USA nation. Not just MAGA, but the people who *seek* hate on Reddit to mock and hate MAGA. All hate is toxic to me, swimming in a toxic cesspool of social media like Vince Gilligan described February 15, 2025 at his writers guild speech. 

I don't want to hate MAGA, I don't want to hate Putin, I don't want to hate Trump, I don't want to hate my self as a human on planet Earth. I want Pale Blue Dot Pride and I believe, it is my faith, that we the people must address hate itself and end hate. Not waiting of a magical Kepler 22B signal or Eden signal of science fiction story to *fix it for us* from outside Earth. We The People, All of Us, Pluribus - must work hard and hammer past the egoism to recognize the programming since year 2014 [Year 2014 description: Our Programmable Minds](/Art/ScreenPlay/Our_Programmable_Minds/Year_2014_Description.md) that has wrecked the USA and beyond. The poisoning of the Great Seal of the Untied States of America messages, including Latin word "PLURIBUS".

# One person took stress seriously

I was standing up to the hive mind, like Carol. And one person actually responded and didn't pile on with the mob mentality.

My message was pretty clear about how cesspool and toxic Reddit social media was:    

> Okkkk I'm a little confused as to what you're saying. 

I'm getting all these "medical doctors" on Reddit who keep badgering me when I talk about Carol, Helen, Vince Gilligan, ABQ, Pirate Lady, a fiction television show meaning and ideas.

I posted a message of a **medical doctor"* message I got on Reddit. Is this what people do on 4-day holiday weekends, Saturday Nigh in USA 2026?

Why won't you talk about the TV show that is the community topic, why are you badgering me?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* Of course, Reddit censored this reply instantly, never published it.
* The Reddit desire is to have I.C.E. secret police remove trouble-makers silently in the night. Masked people who "enforce" the removal of users. No-identity Reddit throw-away accounts, no-identity policing force. A nightmare of people disappeared in front f you every day. Millions of accounts, then people go create new ones. People have no sense of history, that long-distance communication allows people to be disappeared, body-less minds. Marshall McLuhan was teaching about this in the 1970's openly to the public. Now, people have no concept of the power they have handed and how being deport-happy USA is a result of TV channel blocking, social media blocking, book blocking, book censoring, book burning. James Joyce's books were banned in USA... not allowed.

Ultimately everyone is copying the massive financial and power success of Donald Trump. Do crazy insane things, drive people crazy. If you are trying to compete with Trump, YOU ARE CONSTANTLY FORCED TO DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN WHAT (accidentally hit caps lock) Trump is doing! It forces you to constantly engage Crazy. As Michael Moore had on his 11/9 Trump film, eye of the hurricane metaphor.  Trump sits calm in the middle and stirs everyone around into a frenzy. That is his social power. People are attracted to the self-harm of going near, like a dare. Reddit is constantly streaming photos and words of Trump for mocking stimulation. Hate stimulation.

Nerds and autistic people build the internet, but now the "you need help" discussion of a TV show and a real-world Founding Fathers Free Masons symbolism system gets people mocking and insulting you. Even TRYING to stand up for your convictions is mocked. The mental anguish of living under Donald Trump and not finding hate amusing and funny all the time... is horrific.  "Hurts like heck" 

* "1:11:04 thirdly, there is the individual who rises above these and becomes the conscious choice maker. Less you think this kind of person has a wonderful time all the time. 1:11:27 and to be conscious hurts. [it hurts like heck. it hurts like hell. Because, to make those decisions, that's worse than anything."](../../Stephan_A_Hoeller_Quotes.md)

&nbsp;

* Reddit ban message: "We don't tolerate any behaviors that discourage others from participating in communities, conversations, or the Reddit platform through harassment, bullying, intimidation, sexualizing someone without their consent, or abuse. Any communities or people that incite or engage in harassment or abuse towards an individual or group will be banned."

The constant messages of "ok buddy cinema", "circle jerk" are all about doing exactly that. The lack of desire and respect for what a Wiki and FAQ brings to the table is why cesspools are so common. People actively do not want to get *on the same page* of books or FAQ or Wiki.

But apparently ceiling people "schizophrenic" in public and "go seek medical doctors" messages is allowed. You aren't allowed to call someone a cyber-bully. The deeper problem is people won't engage quotes from books that explain themes of the show. They just downvote or ignore them completely. They start talking about the person who shares comments instead of actually discussing the show themes and concepts. And you are supposed to just ignore the anti-intellectual behavior of avoiding the show discussion.

I don't report people for personal insults. Because I don't think it should be swept under the rug. My entire point is describing the cesspool so people actually understand the problem. I think the behaviors should be discussed openly and people face up to the very issues of "Pluribus" world peace. 

Bullies and warmongers end up in power because people prize hate. I can't find anyone wanting to prize MLK Jr's teachings from February 28, 1954. And people don't even want to discuss the ideas.

Vince Gilligan is doing what everyone desires. Go spend millions of dollars per episode and create a 9 hour presentation that takes 3 years to create. And send your message in a nice wrapped package. But people entirely do not get the point. Nor do people find Joseph Campbell's two books attractive. Goodness itself is not attractive.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Trump Values Reddit

The Trump Values, what people prize have become what Reddit prizes. Hate messages. Seeking out things to block, deport, ridicule, mock. The front page of /r/All is a celebration of hate. Celebration of mocking.

People do not see it as a world war breeding ground of raising children to hate and disrespect other races and nations and Spanish language. What attracts the Reddit audience is that "Trump bad" so he is an easy target to bully and mock. And endless June 16, 2015 onward practice of mocking, dehumanize thy enemy Trump, hate thy enemy, hate thy neighbor Trump, has made it all like military training of the entire audience.

On this GitHub will find me raise again and again last year "cult" keyword. People say brainwashing and cult, but won't assert Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 independent film efforts! Rally around a book, film, goodness! Assert goodness. But instead... people copycat the huge success of Trump.

People can not see that they will not admit that Trump is a success. You see so many messages calling people { losers, failures, drunks at the Pentagon, etc } but that isn't cult deprogramming. That's actually just teaching every person in the nation to mock every other out-group. Every person AGREES to mocking and hate.

The 1954 Equation from February 28, 1954 by MLK jr on Hate. People want mutually assured destruction, to keep promoting hate. Vince Gilligan spoke up about the cesspool of social media February 16, 2025... but people in the audience of the show didn't bring that up. I was the only one remembering 10 or 11 months earlier. Everyone lives like Trump in the *now* of *past goodness does not matter*. In fact, "great again" is all about bring past *badness*. Hate, racism, rock music stars getting girls age 12 and girls age 13. 

Campbell told me: "The momentum of history behind it is too great for anything really significant to evolve from that kind of action."

The momentum of what Neil Postman described in year 1985: USA Today newspaper, CNN news... local TV news... became 11 years later Fox News 1996... and now Reddit is super super super Fox News. And the trend never stopped. The momentum of cravings for decorated President in meme packages...

During the government shutdown food concerns in November 2025, every person knows of The Bible, yet nobody wants to bother with being the repeater and reminder all the time "Epstein List" of Bible Verse "1 John 3:17".  Instead, repeating and asserting 'Epstein List" has only made the legend of sexual power of Trump even bigger. Fundamentals of WHY you don't bully people with food and housing and diseases / bad health care system in "1 John 3:17" seems is not understood. Like Leo B said, osmosis isn't working!

"You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis. We'll it's not working by osmosis!"
