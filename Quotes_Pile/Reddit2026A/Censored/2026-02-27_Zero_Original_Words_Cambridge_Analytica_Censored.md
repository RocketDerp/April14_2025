https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy.
