But my Reddit profile has "insane" content you can't name. Because you are delusional, you have media psychosis. You can't face up to factual information from Johns Hopkins University. You just call "politics" a threat to the entire world, a world war of Putin and Trump, just as an excuse to live in your psychological denial that people read a BOOK called "Bible" and hear Jesus in their head in outer-space! And you ignore cults, which are media cults like Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump and Elon Musk Twitter cult. This  isn't about politics, it's about your inability to state any fact of what is "insane" about my Reddit profile with evidence of the drug pushers. You can't READ my profile and name any specifics. That's a literacy issue.

Reference: September 9, 2014 - Johns Hopkins University information expert is author of this article: By Peter Pomerantsev  

* "At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations" - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

A video is on my REDDIT PROFILE from Peter Pomerantsev, which you say a Johns Hopkins University expert is "insane" on my profile. You can't be specific what exactly is non-factual and untrue! You just toss around words like an ignorant person who can't quote and be precise! You are anti-Woke, not Woke to information warfare.
