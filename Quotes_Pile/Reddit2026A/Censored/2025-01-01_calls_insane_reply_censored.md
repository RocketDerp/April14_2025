What's insane is the Artificial Intelligence that prevents your reply messages from being published. That magically disappears your reply. People get "the last word" by triggering the Reddit Artificial Intelligence censorship.

You seem confused about morality and lots of issues. You call others insane because you are shallow, superficial, banal.

> Clearly you're passionate but won't give any proof or anything

You are ignorant that Reddit will ban me if I "brigade" posts with links. LOOK at my profile. You BLIND? Or just ignorant?

> Whole account is insane

EXACTLY what is "insane"? Are you a doctor? Or are you a bullshitter who can't quote anything off my profile, because you are just here to cover up the take-drug messages on my profile?
