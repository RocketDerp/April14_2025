There is a massive street gang here that are intimidating anyone who is serious and thoughtful. It is a hate-filled pro-MAGA anti-literacy anti-book anti-education fandom of RFK Jr and Secretary Linda McMahon. https://www.aclu.org/news/racial-justice/trumps-attack-on-the-department-of-education-explained

>  so much annoyed reactions

They are anti-goodness across the board here.  Lesbian women on the show seems to really have them motivated here on male-dominated Reddit. If they even get the slightest whiff that you don't bow to  Linda McMahon mindsets and hive mind thinking... you will get all kinds of low-effort reply comments and attempts at gatekeeping their gang turf of this Latin language Great Seal of the United States of America teaching show.
