My god *man* / verse Galatians 3:28 gender-person. It's like what i saw on /r/All today when a cop pulled someone over and asked: why are you so far from home? What's the purpose of an automobile, stay in your driveway?

The show is "PLURIBUS", it is a Free Mason message encoded in Latin language. It is on the DOLLAR BILL! It cost $1.00 for a paper copy of the teaching!!!

> Nobody gaf about the free masons.

You don't want "freedom". You want hive mind slavery to Musk and "free masons" with "free thinking" you don't give a fuck about on your Apple devices touch screen hugging.

You give a fuck about following South African immigrant Elon Musk StarLink signals who is telling you to speak in Twitter-length tiny-shirt extremely banal message of Twitter.

Fucking Reddit has a long form message legacy going back over TWENTY YEARS. This isn't the land of your tiny-shirt messaging that banalizes everything into dumb jokes and memes. Wake the fuck up, people!
