Front page of Reddit posting. Twitter screen shots, Elon Musk Twitter content on Reddit. Simulacra of "resisting" the promotion of Charlie Kirk and Erika.

Reddit audience is deeply attracted to the Bible mocking leadership that Turning Point Faith provides. Mocking Reddit audience follows Twitter mocking leadership signals, MAGA mocking leadership, Turning Point mocking leadership. It is all a pattern of following signals of mocking and dehumanization.

There is no demonstration on Reddit of self-awareness of being lead by the nose / leash lead, by Elon Musk Twitter media systems. All signs and behaviors indicate a mob mentality of thinking they have out-smarted the out-groups ( Twitter, Turning Point, Internet Research Agency seeding since March 2013 }... no invocation of { Media Ecology, Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan }. Despite the long-established Time Magazine just months ago re-asserting Neil Postman's 1985 media ecology about addict self-awareness (Reddit high speed electric media audience). September 10, 2025: https://time.com/7313999/neil-postman-trump-prediction/ only 113 days ago! The "Mass Man" (group think, term from University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan) keeps jumping from mockery leading signal to the next signal without any self-awareness of compulsive following. Tree after tree can't recognize the forest patterns of being lead by Putin's Kremlin since March 2013 into total *friendly-fire* of Americans mocking Americans in feedback loops.

Note the Reddit account bio for this end-user. They claim to be against MAGA values, yet still fall right into the [5,000 simulacra patterns originating in November 2012](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md#november-12-2016). Americans mocking Americans, not calling for Bible literacy reforming (non-believer isn't relevant, believer isn't relevant, literacy of "1 John 3:17" and verse "1 John 4:20" intelligent reading is the concern). Not calling for Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 nonfiction film to address Fox News and Newsmax addictions. Not calling for organized rally points and prioritizing forest-level changes.

Instead, it is bark at Americans, bark within the simulacra systems as conditioned by Putin. Tree after tree, simulation of Twitter message after Twitter message in the Reddit audience. Following the hive mind flocking, not standing up for change towards goodness, following right into MAGA values / Putinism media ecology mindsets.

https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/1q1clj4/to_not_admit_to_human_trafficking/nx4mcyn/

This whole posting is simulacra of resistance. Comments like this think they are out-smarting the name-calling of [Trump "low I.Q." "horce-face" (non-person) and other dog-whistle dehumanization](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-long-history-calling-women-crazy-attacking-appearances/story?id=48348956)... but they have all *adopted* it. It's the most powerful system of control. Surkov student techniques have defeated the nation. All people are truly deeply concerned about is their attraction to insulting and mocking. They have no desire to end the mocking because it is the stimulation that Putin has fed the nation since March 2013 and they find it thrilling. It's constantly exhausting translating all the nicknames and in-jokes and morphing Trump-speak MAGA-speak that Reddit society flocks to.

Top popular comment. Tiny-short think Tweet-length Musk messaging values. "She" choose to pick deporting people who she dislikes. Egoism, anti-Pluribus values. Now the hive mind of Reddit and fandom have adopted the Putin programmed / immigrant Elon Musk "woke mind virus" programming of praising and cheering on deportation, block-happy, deport-happy USA. 

It's all MAGA values all the time now. People hand-wave "both sides", but do not in any way articulate Russian Information Warfare methods "Internet Research Agency" programming and Rupert Murdoch programming of audiences. Fiction vs. fiction is not "both sides", it's simulations of resistance. There is 99.999999999% in fiction addiction, there is no "two sides" ("bothsides-ism") logic here, there is an abandonment of goodness in favor of punishing with deportation. Punishing with deportation is March 2013 onward MAGA values. Going after women is MAGA values.

Prizing deport as punishment is Putinsim since year 2013. "a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult—to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo. We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone’s protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years—and if you’re going on for your Ph. D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection." - 1988, Power of Myth

This isn't just *any* simulation here. Twitter messages are programming the Reddit audience to prize hate. That's hard-core MAGA year 2013 programming for the Internet Research Agency that keeps echoing / repeating / retweeting over and over in loops! People are behaving just like MAGA in January 2026, programmed to prize hate and find joy in the suffering of other people. This is hard-core mind-fuck programming, the deepest year renewal symbolism to *hate harder* USA.

Machine message programming of audiences on Reddit touch devices. That's the ARG here, hate humans, love Twitter power to express hate at high speed instant light-speeds. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuObGsB0No 91,862,547 views August 29, 2013

I honestly just can't take this any more. Front page of Reddit. People are humor-washing, entertainment-washing, artificial intelligence praising, dreaming they could tweak him fatter in the AI video. 

The experience of being media awake to Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and the rise of MAGA. People are so attracted to MAGA images. The 2025 South Park entertainment of MAGA, this video. It isn't even just one person, Trump.

Neil Postman already wrote the book, and I did everything speaking in the streets that this was Trump's power. And Time magazine published it last fall too, and people just keep feeding the desires for more and more fiction content. Fiction of watching White House dance. Trump shares these fiction videos himself. Because he knows mobs of Reddit and Twitter will rush to it and drown out Neil Postman.

What really bothers me now is that the bar is so low, the slightest non-Trump leader will be ruled. And the Pluribus hive mind concept will never have taken off. Carl Sagan's 1995 book really was right. And my hopes (the Elvis song in Pluribus trailer of hope) is gone. Social media addictions, what Neil Postman described, created this Trump invading nations. People prize mocking at him as fat. that's it. Like they prize mocking people as dumb and stupid. It's not teaching. And when you promote teaching, as Malala did back in year 2012 and year 2013, it gets ignored.

* [Timeline of Donald Trump being center of attention vs. Malala's girls, young people (millions, not just one Malala) being center of attention year 2012 onward](/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md)

* "The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

This was correct in year 1995, and we are living in the outcomes of that. And Carl Sagan people listened to, but *still*... the Apple iPhone in year 2007 set prizing of tiny-short dancing Trump, or dancing whoever is next, entertainment.

Tiny-shirt Twitter-length thinking. Twitter-bird repeating, parroting, of Russian information warfare talking points. Blame millions of USA people, do everything and anything to not blame Kremlin information warfare. Never ever ever mention this book author's name on Reddit, and his 3 books since year 2014.

* “The display, which was called **'Can Democracy Survive the Internet?'** was dedicated to a 'global election management' company called Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica claimed to have gathered 5,000 data points on every American voter online: what you liked and what you shared on social media; how and where you shopped; who your friends were... They claimed to be able to take this imprint of your online self, use it to understand your deepest drives and desires, and then draw on that analysis to change your voting behaviour. The boast seemed to be backed up by success: Cambridge Analytica had worked on the victorious American presidential campaign of Donald Trump; it had also run successful campaigns for US Senator Ted Cruz (twice); and others all across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

Russia has gotten deep into the minds with entertainment. Not just voting days, but every upvote and retweet.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1q3yjp2/his_past_has_shown_exactly_that/nxoy7n2/

Reddit audiences will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING but turn to Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and focus on it every day (every 6 hours) until it is memorized or whatnot. And LOOK AT REDDIT through the Neil Postman 1985 perspective and Brave New World 1930's perspective. And sober up from the meme-think garbage learning. Anti-learning. People are not resisting it, they are incredibly attracted to Fox News HDTV and White House Antics to mock and talk about. It is exactly what Postman was saying about second term President in year 1985!!!

2. Dumb shit vs. dumb shit

3. Reddit audience eats this shit up. EVERY TIME from MAGA shit.

4. Thrilled at how amusing it is to watch their nation be dumb and stupid

5. Reddit meme fandom (Twitter message fandom too) of how glorious it is that the White House provides such mockery. "associated with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) is Linda McMahon, who became the U.S. Secretary of Education in March 2025 under President Trump, bringing her business background (including leading WWE) into the role, aligning with a focus on school choice and parental rights in education."

&nbsp;

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

Front page of Reddit. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, a real estate investor, property investor. This is propaganda on Reddit to cheer on the wealthy 1% who own everything in USA and to imprison people who need a bed to sleep in in USA so that more Trump golf courses and Trump hotels and Trump need to take over Canada and Greenland because real estate profits are more important than human beings needing food. Stealing food from homeless people, poisoning their home life, intimidating them with guns and weapons. MAGA NRA values, Russian NRA values. Reddit users / Reddit audience cheers on the lords of property owners that all vote for and worship Rupert Murdoch, Trump, Bill Gates landowner.  

This is what the Internet Research Agency has done to the mindsets of the nation since March 2013. Praising kings of land, like Putin taking over Ukraine land because Russia's vast amounts of land are never enough! All housing and land must pay taxes to Trump and Putin in the world. Reddit thinks this is awesome because it's clever, and Trump is clever and Putin is clever.

A police-cop or I.C.E. or landlord-raider of the homeless is cheered on by Reddit audiences. ICE raids are cool awesome content for meme addicts on their intimate touch iPhone and iPad to cheer on the wealth lords of USA year 2026! Poor troubled people, *fuck the poor*, cheer on the super-rich people who own thousands of houses for money-making off people they pay to raid like ICE raids. Because this guy is so clever with the eating of all the food, "hate thy neighbor" like Trump is organizing hate mobs against Canada.  Reddit users prize video and clever over all else. Just like was described in year 1951, not very long after year 1944. Second Bill of Rights January 1944, mocked, because that isn't clever live video for meme addicts on Reddit!

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

It happened one time before, with a second-term POTUS year 1985:

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Low-effort tiny-short Reddit commenting to call leaders { dumb, stupid, idiot, moron }. Over and over for more than 11 years and 6 months. Every day, calling people stupid. No book quotes, no education or teaching, just simulating a resistance by insulting and mocking. Followers of Trump's lead of social media: turn all commenting and ideas into stupid-prizing. Surkov won.

The simulacra right in the face of Reddit. And people program it into their mind and act like this is just another day of memes and amusement. When billionaires use Elon Musk richest person in the world media systems, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook / Meta media empire, Truth Social media empire, Reddit media empire... to NOT challenge the addictions to media... the induced hive mind behaviors of media cultists.

Because this is what appeals to Reddit audiences. Simulation of resistance. A cartoon image, a X / Twitter screen shot. A low-effort mockery back and fort, feedback looping of mock for mock. A game loop. Gamers, sports gaming in rectangle predictable images on a screen, screen gaming, video gaming. Chidlren raised since 1979 with Atari systems, Nintendo, Playstation from Sony. Everything is simulation and cartoon images and logic prized above all else. Simple-think, Twitter is the richest man in the entire world feeding insincere content to Reddit audience. Fiction outselling nonfiction.

The branding of this as "MURDER!!!!! By WORDS!!!!" is the very falsehoods and lies Reddit audiences flock to. Elon Musk Twitter, Truth Social (fiction content), Fox News, memes and junk information is what people seek out to give low-effort commenting. The population using free time, spare time, spent **avoiding progressive use of information systems** repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev, Bill Moyers }. This is the top of the commenting page, the most prized comment! Low-effort Tweet-length anti-learning. Marshall McLuhan understanding is lost in memeland society. This is Trump's extreme power, to make people prize low bar of measure, television and meme entertainment above all else in leadership systems.

Mocking people as "nuts", exactly what Trump does. Insulting, name-calling, dismissing the problem. Instead of promoting and quoting nonfiction learning from Dr. Bandy X Lee, this is the top-prized low-effort mocking the out-group conditioned popularity.

A laugh-track message for Reddit audiences to find it entertaining and amusing that they are being manipulated. Comedy-wrapping, Comedy-washing, sane-washing via humor mind-blowing. Meme addicts eating out of the hands of the meme providers. This isn't resisting, this is cheering on how "dumb" the others are when democracy does not work when everyone just calls others dumb and ignores seriously deep education from Marshall McLuhan since the 1950's.

* "the nature of American politics as a permanent campaign has become deeply rooted. Worse, the campaign is not only permanent but also increasingly polarized along partisan lines, and that polarization extends to nearly every aspect of governance. Much of the blame for this state of affairs resides with Newt Gingrich, 33 the mastermind of the 1994 Republican Revolution. Prior to Gingrich's ascent, the Republican minority leader, Robert H.

In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. **We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth**. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a **perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.

Using comedy television show to meme-wrap MAGA and Trump as impossible to defeat. Abandon impeachment efforts, use social media to promote for-profit television entertainment! ANYTHING and EVERYTHING on Reddit to avoid asserting Dr. Bandy X Lee and her nonfiction serious books about the problems. Just meme away and don't stand up for serious intelligent people who write important books on the crisis!

* "There is no question but that Hitler belongs in the category of the truly mystic medicine man. As somebody commented about him at the last Nürnberg party congress, since the time of Mohammed nothing like it has been seen in this world. His body does not suggest strength. The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer. This markedly mystic characteristic of Hitler's is what makes him do things which seem to us illogical, inexplicable, and unreasonable. ... So you see, Hitler is a medicine man, a spiritual vessel, a demi-deity or, even better, a myth." - Doctor Carl G Jung. During an interview with H. R. Knickerbocker, first published in Hearst's International Cosmopolitan (**January 1939**), in which Jung was asked to diagnose Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin

People are in denial that Trump is first and foremost a media icon, a symbol of media content, and people blow their minds out on media messages! Fox News HDTV audience crisis, the purchase of Twitter media by Elon Musk, Facebook alternate realities, etc. Since March 2013, Russia has been waging an information war against NATO and USA!

A dozen subreddits all proclaim this as the important topic to rally around! In no way is this resisting Trump, this is Trump playing the bad guy and audiences reacting. This is President Tony Clifton performing for his fandoms. Hate leadership / readership fandom, deep symbol gumbo of American POTUS + FORD + shit-talking keys.

Fox News HDTV problem isn't taken seriously, Jen Senko's nonfiction film not cited nearly enough. Dr. Bandy X Lee since early 2017 barely given any pubic attention. While sex monster Epstein is given nonstop repeating as important name, not even for change or arrest, just for "information list", Q Drop / QAnon style information pursuit.

The adult men who admire and follow and consume Joe Rogan as a product and "experience" are far more concern than Joe Rogan himself. That people consider his content as something to follow and learn from. There are so many topics to study and analyze in this world, and Joe Rogan is an attraction to religion-like clergy for billionaires. Like Rupert Murdoch's fandom / audiences.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qcn9ga/that_will_show_them/nzjb78q/

They aren't "offended", they are aggressively blocking the media. Social media blocking, deporting, self-deporting, bullying away people they disagree with. It is information war, the film itself, the message egoism and egomania. It is a symptom of **information overload**, diversity, and incredibly popular on Bluesky and Reddit to **announce you are burning books, burning films, deleting film, blocking a human person with ICE**. Just like wrecking other animals or plant life on Earth, destruction. Anti-diversity, anti-goodness.

Screen shot of Musk Twitter on Reddit, this is simulation of resistance. The comments are Twitter-length tweet-think binary logic. The saddest think is Reddit audience thinks it is *winning*... by repeating MAGA phrase "snowflake" throughout the comment section. That's MAGA year 2015 behavior that is now everyone USA behavior year 2026. Anti-education, anti-teaching. Just bonfire of the Tweet-think mind patterns that the IRA conditioned since March 2013. (Bonfire of education, teaching, goodness). 

* German-Jewish poet Heinrich Heine: "Where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people also" (or "Where they burn books, they will, in the end, burn human beings too"). Originally from his **year 1821** play *Almansor*.. because of the Bible book driven *Spanish Inquisition*. People who believe there is one and only one perfect book in the entire public library: The Bible science fiction book with magical outer-space pregnancy of a virgin woman. Gullibility to confuse fiction with nonfiction. Film burning on Apple TV+ may not require flame and paper, but it is book burning. They did not have films in Germany in year 1821 for people to burn as physical media.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qcn9ga/that_will_show_them/nzjeln7/

Reddit tells anti-MAGA how to think. Fiction vs. fiction. Avengers is fiction storytelling. Bible is fiction storytelling. clergy vs. clergy. 

Following what other people tell you to think isn't a problem if it is goodness. All getting on the same page f a good ideas is not a threat. All commenting on different trees of messages on Reddit and avoiding Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and leadership since year 2017 is a terrible behavior and terrible thinking.

Because billionaires advertise on Reddit media and people do not want to confront media ecology. Marshall McLuhan education and teaching from University of Toronto has been abandoned to the general public. Billionaires have ensured that Marshall McLuhan's 1970' public education is not applied to Rupert Murdoch's public education systems since October 7, 1996. Media ecology is the absent education in a working healthy democracy. Reddit user is calling out the problem but not offering education and teaching and learning **for adults** as a solution. We can rescue USA from Putin's Internet Research Agency... if we stop commenting all on different pages of Reddit and get on serious important topics, *the same page*.

This is over 10 years old, why is it not well know as subreddit vs. subreddit, filter-bubble education of self-awareness? 

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

THRILLED audience member of Reddit to have images / video of hate messaging delivered to intimate touch device. Eating out of Putin's hands. Eating out of Twitter owner Elon Musk hands in his HQ of Austin, Texas. Eating out of Rupert Murdoch hands. It's scripted Reality TV fiction in the public streets. Mock vs. mock. Reddit audience eats it up, an enemy to hate upon! Would not want to use Reddit to promote Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction book on paper to stand up to the media crisis of people parroting Fox News and mind-fucked by Putin. Also note **this is not a 79 year old man with dementia** saying the same lines MAGA is saying all over the nation. This is the outcome of mass mind manipulation.

* "Ours is the first age in which many thousands of the best-trained individual minds have made it a full-time business to get inside the collective public mind. To get inside in order to manipulate, exploit, control is the object now. And to generate heat, not light, is the intention. To keep everybody in the helpless state engendered by prolonged mental rutting" - [University of Toronto; Marshall McLuhan](/Art/ScreenPlay/Mental_Rutting/Public_Helplessness.md)

This is what has gone on for over 10 years. Social media audiences avoiding standing up and asserting goodness. Mocking MAGA is not resisting MAGA, the MAGA person MOCKED FIRST! Total Mockery is what the audience is engaging, a society where mocking itself is wrecking goodness. Lead by the Reality TV star that mocks nonfiction science and book reading.

* "elaborated in a follow-up interview, “Trump creates his own **extreme manipulation of reality**. He insists that his spokesmen defend his false reality **as normal**. He then expects the rest of society to accept it — despite the lack of any evidence.” This leads to what Lifton calls “malignant normality” — in other words, the **gradual acceptance by a public inundated with toxic untruths** of those untruths until they pass for normal.”
