Front page of Reddit posting. Twitter screen shots, Elon Musk Twitter content on Reddit. Simulacra of "resisting" the promotion of Charlie Kirk and Erika.

Reddit audience is deeply attracted to the Bible mocking leadership that Turning Point Faith provides. Mocking Reddit audience follows Twitter mocking leadership signals, MAGA mocking leadership, Turning Point mocking leadership. It is all a pattern of following signals of mocking and dehumanization.

There is no demonstration on Reddit of self-awareness of being lead by the nose / leash lead, by Elon Musk Twitter media systems. All signs and behaviors indicate a mob mentality of thinking they have out-smarted the out-groups ( Twitter, Turning Point, Internet Research Agency seeding since March 2013 }... no invocation of { Media Ecology, Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan }. Despite the long-established Time Magazine just months ago re-asserting Neil Postman's 1985 media ecology about addict self-awareness (Reddit high speed electric media audience). September 10, 2025: https://time.com/7313999/neil-postman-trump-prediction/ only 113 days ago! The "Mass Man" (group think, term from University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan) keeps jumping from mockery leading signal to the next signal without any self-awareness of compulsive following. Tree after tree can't recognize the forest patterns of being lead by Putin's Kremlin since March 2013 into total *friendly-fire* of Americans mocking Americans in feedback loops.

Note the Reddit account bio for this end-user. They claim to be against MAGA values, yet still fall right into the [5,000 simulacra patterns originating in November 2012](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md#november-12-2016). Americans mocking Americans, not calling for Bible literacy reforming (non-believer isn't relevant, believer isn't relevant, literacy of "1 John 3:17" and verse "1 John 4:20" intelligent reading is the concern). Not calling for Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 nonfiction film to address Fox News and Newsmax addictions. Not calling for organized rally points and prioritizing forest-level changes.

Instead, it is bark at Americans, bark within the simulacra systems as conditioned by Putin. Tree after tree, simulation of Twitter message after Twitter message in the Reddit audience. Following the hive mind flocking, not standing up for change towards goodness, following right into MAGA values / Putinism media ecology mindsets.

https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/1q1clj4/to_not_admit_to_human_trafficking/nx4mcyn/

This whole posting is simulacra of resistance. Comments like this think they are out-smarting the name-calling of [Trump "low I.Q." "horce-face" (non-person) and other dog-whistle dehumanization](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-long-history-calling-women-crazy-attacking-appearances/story?id=48348956)... but they have all *adopted* it. It's the most powerful system of control. Surkov student techniques have defeated the nation. All people are truly deeply concerned about is their attraction to insulting and mocking. They have no desire to end the mocking because it is the stimulation that Putin has fed the nation since March 2013 and they find it thrilling. It's constantly exhausting translating all the nicknames and in-jokes and morphing Trump-speak MAGA-speak that Reddit society flocks to.

Top popular comment. Tiny-short think Tweet-length Musk messaging values. "She" choose to pick deporting people who she dislikes. Egoism, anti-Pluribus values. Now the hive mind of Reddit and fandom have adopted the Putin programmed / immigrant Elon Musk "woke mind virus" programming of praising and cheering on deportation, block-happy, deport-happy USA. 

It's all MAGA values all the time now. People hand-wave "both sides", but do not in any way articulate Russian Information Warfare methods "Internet Research Agency" programming and Rupert Murdoch programming of audiences. Fiction vs. fiction is not "both sides", it's simulations of resistance. There is 99.999999999% in fiction addiction, there is no "two sides" ("bothsides-ism") logic here, there is an abandonment of goodness in favor of punishing with deportation. Punishing with deportation is March 2013 onward MAGA values. Going after women is MAGA values.

Prizing deport as punishment is Putinsim since year 2013. "a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult—to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo. We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone’s protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years—and if you’re going on for your Ph. D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection." - 1988, Power of Myth

This isn't just *any* simulation here. Twitter messages are programming the Reddit audience to prize hate. That's hard-core MAGA year 2013 programming for the Internet Research Agency that keeps echoing / repeating / retweeting over and over in loops! People are behaving just like MAGA in January 2026, programmed to prize hate and find joy in the suffering of other people. This is hard-core mind-fuck programming, the deepest year renewal symbolism to *hate harder* USA.

Machine message programming of audiences on Reddit touch devices. That's the ARG here, hate humans, love Twitter power to express hate at high speed instant light-speeds. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuObGsB0No 91,862,547 views August 29, 2013

I honestly just can't take this any more. Front page of Reddit. People are humor-washing, entertainment-washing, artificial intelligence praising, dreaming they could tweak him fatter in the AI video. 

The experience of being media awake to Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and the rise of MAGA. People are so attracted to MAGA images. The 2025 South Park entertainment of MAGA, this video. It isn't even just one person, Trump.

Neil Postman already wrote the book, and I did everything speaking in the streets that this was Trump's power. And Time magazine published it last fall too, and people just keep feeding the desires for more and more fiction content. Fiction of watching White House dance. Trump shares these fiction videos himself. Because he knows mobs of Reddit and Twitter will rush to it and drown out Neil Postman.

What really bothers me now is that the bar is so low, the slightest non-Trump leader will be ruled. And the Pluribus hive mind concept will never have taken off. Carl Sagan's 1995 book really was right. And my hopes (the Elvis song in Pluribus trailer of hope) is gone. Social media addictions, what Neil Postman described, created this Trump invading nations. People prize mocking at him as fat. that's it. Like they prize mocking people as dumb and stupid. It's not teaching. And when you promote teaching, as Malala did back in year 2012 and year 2013, it gets ignored.

* [Timeline of Donald Trump being center of attention vs. Malala's girls, young people (millions, not just one Malala) being center of attention year 2012 onward](/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md)

* "The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

This was correct in year 1995, and we are living in the outcomes of that. And Carl Sagan people listened to, but *still*... the Apple iPhone in year 2007 set prizing of tiny-short dancing Trump, or dancing whoever is next, entertainment.

Tiny-shirt Twitter-length thinking. Twitter-bird repeating, parroting, of Russian information warfare talking points. Blame millions of USA people, do everything and anything to not blame Kremlin information warfare. Never ever ever mention this book author's name on Reddit, and his 3 books since year 2014.

* “The display, which was called **'Can Democracy Survive the Internet?'** was dedicated to a 'global election management' company called Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica claimed to have gathered 5,000 data points on every American voter online: what you liked and what you shared on social media; how and where you shopped; who your friends were... They claimed to be able to take this imprint of your online self, use it to understand your deepest drives and desires, and then draw on that analysis to change your voting behaviour. The boast seemed to be backed up by success: Cambridge Analytica had worked on the victorious American presidential campaign of Donald Trump; it had also run successful campaigns for US Senator Ted Cruz (twice); and others all across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

Russia has gotten deep into the minds with entertainment. Not just voting days, but every upvote and retweet.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1q3yjp2/his_past_has_shown_exactly_that/nxoy7n2/

Reddit audiences will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING but turn to Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and focus on it every day (every 6 hours) until it is memorized or whatnot. And LOOK AT REDDIT through the Neil Postman 1985 perspective and Brave New World 1930's perspective. And sober up from the meme-think garbage learning. Anti-learning. People are not resisting it, they are incredibly attracted to Fox News HDTV and White House Antics to mock and talk about. It is exactly what Postman was saying about second term President in year 1985!!!

2. Dumb shit vs. dumb shit

3. Reddit audience eats this shit up. EVERY TIME from MAGA shit.

4. Thrilled at how amusing it is to watch their nation be dumb and stupid

5. Reddit meme fandom (Twitter message fandom too) of how glorious it is that the White House provides such mockery. "associated with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) is Linda McMahon, who became the U.S. Secretary of Education in March 2025 under President Trump, bringing her business background (including leading WWE) into the role, aligning with a focus on school choice and parental rights in education."

&nbsp;

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

Front page of Reddit. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, a real estate investor, property investor. This is propaganda on Reddit to cheer on the wealthy 1% who own everything in USA and to imprison people who need a bed to sleep in in USA so that more Trump golf courses and Trump hotels and Trump need to take over Canada and Greenland because real estate profits are more important than human beings needing food. Stealing food from homeless people, poisoning their home life, intimidating them with guns and weapons. MAGA NRA values, Russian NRA values. Reddit users / Reddit audience cheers on the lords of property owners that all vote for and worship Rupert Murdoch, Trump, Bill Gates landowner.  

This is what the Internet Research Agency has done to the mindsets of the nation since March 2013. Praising kings of land, like Putin taking over Ukraine land because Russia's vast amounts of land are never enough! All housing and land must pay taxes to Trump and Putin in the world. Reddit thinks this is awesome because it's clever, and Trump is clever and Putin is clever.

A police-cop or I.C.E. or landlord-raider of the homeless is cheered on by Reddit audiences. ICE raids are cool awesome content for meme addicts on their intimate touch iPhone and iPad to cheer on the wealth lords of USA year 2026! Poor troubled people, *fuck the poor*, cheer on the super-rich people who own thousands of houses for money-making off people they pay to raid like ICE raids. Because this guy is so clever with the eating of all the food, "hate thy neighbor" like Trump is organizing hate mobs against Canada.  Reddit users prize video and clever over all else. Just like was described in year 1951, not very long after year 1944. Second Bill of Rights January 1944, mocked, because that isn't clever live video for meme addicts on Reddit!

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

It happened one time before, with a second-term POTUS year 1985:

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Low-effort tiny-short Reddit commenting to call leaders { dumb, stupid, idiot, moron }. Over and over for more than 11 years and 6 months. Every day, calling people stupid. No book quotes, no education or teaching, just simulating a resistance by insulting and mocking. Followers of Trump's lead of social media: turn all commenting and ideas into stupid-prizing. Surkov won.

The simulacra right in the face of Reddit. And people program it into their mind and act like this is just another day of memes and amusement. When billionaires use Elon Musk richest person in the world media systems, Mark Zuckerberg Facebook / Meta media empire, Truth Social media empire, Reddit media empire... to NOT challenge the addictions to media... the induced hive mind behaviors of media cultists. Avoiding repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev, Bill Moyers }

Attacking women, tech / technology lovers. Meme audiences so thrilled to have constant stimulation of White House entertainment. Super, shallow, banal society USA California Reddit. Free time, spare time, spent avoiding repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev, Bill Moyers }

https://old.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/1qaef2u/oh_hell_yeah_id_even_go_ppv/nz2c78u/

Front page of Reddit. Fiction images to talk bout "White skin color Twitter" defeating the amusement providers / entertainers. Simulation of resistance, fake images, fiction storytelling. The population using free time, spare time, spent **avoiding progressive use of information systems** repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev, Bill Moyers }.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1qbofub/its_always_the_ones_who_call_themselves_christians/nzc2y52/

Because this is what appeals to Reddit audiences. Simulation of resistance. A cartoon image, a X / Twitter screen shot. A low-effort mockery back and fort, feedback looping of mock for mock. A game loop. Gamers, sports gaming in rectangle predictable images on a screen, screen gaming, video gaming. Chidlren raised since 1979 with Atari systems, Nintendo, Playstation from Sony. Everything is simulation and cartoon images and logic prized above all else. Simple-think, Twitter is the richest man in the entire world feeding insincere content to Reddit audience. Fiction outselling nonfiction.

The branding of this as "MURDER!!!!! By WORDS!!!!" is the very falsehoods and lies Reddit audiences flock to. Elon Musk Twitter, Truth Social (fiction content), Fox News, memes and junk information is what people seek out to give low-effort commenting. The population using free time, spare time, spent **avoiding progressive use of information systems** repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev, Bill Moyers }. This is the top of the commenting page, the most prized comment! Low-effort Tweet-length anti-learning. Marshall McLuhan understanding is lost in memeland society. This is Trump's extreme power, to make people prize low bar of measure, television and meme entertainment above all else in leadership systems.

https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/1qbpw43/to_get_what_they_for_some_insane_reason_paid_for/nzcau61/

Mocking people as "nuts", exactly what Trump does. Insulting, name-calling, dismissing the problem. Instead of promoting and quoting nonfiction learning from Dr. Bandy X Lee, this is the top-prized low-effort mocking the out-group conditioned popularity.

https://old.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/1qbpdjc/wow_hows_that_peace_treating_us/nzc6oac/

Front-page of Reddit. Simulation of "resisting". Eating the shit fed by billionaire media empires to call it funny. A laugh-track message for Reddit audiences to find it entertaining and amusing that they are being manipulated. Comedy-wrapping, Comedy-washing, sane-washing via humor mind-blowing. Meme addicts eating out of the hands of the meme providers. This isn't resisting, this is cheering on how "dumb" the others are when democracy does not work when everyone just calls others dumb and ignores seriously deep education from Marshall McLuhan since the 1950's.

April 13, 2015 social posting. Dust off:

* “Politics will eventually be replaced by imagery.
The politician will be only too happy to abdicate
in favor of his image, because the image will
be much more powerful than he could ever be.”
― Marshall McLuhan. Repeated March 27, 2012 https://McluhanGalaxy.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/marshall-mcluhan-on-politician-image-projection/

This means meme images. And Russia started it, with the Internet Research Agency in Saint Pete, March 2013 started to ramp up. And Reddit audience cheered it on /r/The_Donald and more.

How We the People Have Become the Problem. By Kirby Goidel · 2013" ... 232 pages. December 12, 2013

* "These changes were not without consequence. Where presidents once communicated at college reading levels, today they communicate at an eighth-grade reading level and in more conversational tones." - commenting junk. Page 27 / page 28. December 2013.. Trump on Twitter rising and rising.
* "Television did not create but rather cemented these trends, adding an even more compelling and personalized visual component. With television, John F. Kennedy could lose a presidential debate based on spoken words" - page 28
* "the nature of American politics as a permanent campaign has become deeply rooted. Worse, the campaign is not only permanent but also increasingly polarized along partisan lines, and that polarization extends to nearly every aspect of governance. Much of the blame for this state of affairs resides with Newt Gingrich, 33 the mastermind of the 1994 Republican Revolution. Prior to Gingrich's ascent, the Republican minority leader, Robert H. Michel, operated under the quaint idea that the minority party had a responsibility to work with the majority to solve problems and to forge compromises ( where possible ) to further" - page 30 / page 31

Stand up to the problem sincerely with nonfiction and citations... 1 single review since December 2013, no quotes. We were ready in year 2013 to be exploited by Cambridge Analytica and Russia's Internet Research agency techniques.

* "Cambridge Analytica was founded in 2013. But the company's ability to microtarget traces back to a 2010 Facebook rollout of open graph" https://bipartisanpolicy.org/article/cambridge-analytica-controversy/

* “We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to **cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do**. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to **exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition**? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 12 "Revelations", page 235, year 2019

President Tony Clifton acting on stage, comedy entertainment. Sane-washing with comedy-washing. Late night chuckles and jokes, meme amusement. Surkov students weaponized this since year 2012 and Reddit audiences eat it up! Prizing jokes and comedy performances above all other. That's the faith: humor-seasoning all serious topics, that's why Trump has all the media power and social power that he has.

* “What Huxley teaches is that in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate. In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. **We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth**. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a **perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility. In America, Orwell's prophecies are of small relevance, but Huxley's are well under way toward being realized.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

This is not resisting at all. This is cheering on the sex lives, private jet Epstein behaviors, of world leaders. This is addicts to images of world leaders and their hot wives. Talking about couch sex day in day out. This isn't resisting, this is video gaming mentality, sports gaming fandom thinking, sports mentality that women are booty to show / parade, and trade for powerful men. Reddit audiences line up and flock to these Trickle Down images and storytelling of sexual conquests by powerful men.
