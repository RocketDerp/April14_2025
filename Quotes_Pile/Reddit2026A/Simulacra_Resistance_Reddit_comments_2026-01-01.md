Front page of Reddit posting. Twitter screen shots, Elon Musk Twitter content on Reddit. Simulacra of "resisting" the promotion of Charlie Kirk and Erika.

Reddit audience is deeply attracted to the Bible mocking leadership that Turning Point Faith provides. Mocking Reddit audience follows Twitter mocking leadership signals, MAGA mocking leadership, Turning Point mocking leadership. It is all a pattern of following signals of mocking and dehumanization.

There is no demonstration on Reddit of self-awareness of being lead by the nose / leash lead, by Elon Musk Twitter media systems. All signs and behaviors indicate a mob mentality of thinking they have out-smarted the out-groups ( Twitter, Turning Point, Internet Research Agency seeding since March 2013 }... no invocation of { Media Ecology, Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan }. Despite the long-established Time Magazine just months ago re-asserting Neil Postman's 1985 media ecology about addict self-awareness (Reddit high speed electric media audience). September 10, 2025: https://time.com/7313999/neil-postman-trump-prediction/ only 113 days ago! The "Mass Man" (group think, term from University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan) keeps jumping from mockery leading signal to the next signal without any self-awareness of compulsive following. Tree after tree can't recognize the forest patterns of being lead by Putin's Kremlin since March 2013 into total *friendly-fire* of Americans mocking Americans in feedback loops.

Note the Reddit account bio for this end-user. They claim to be against MAGA values, yet still fall right into the [5,000 simulacra patterns originating in November 2012](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md#november-12-2016). Americans mocking Americans, not calling for Bible literacy reforming (non-believer isn't relevant, believer isn't relevant, literacy of "1 John 3:17" and verse "1 John 4:20" intelligent reading is the concern). Not calling for Jen Senko's 2015 / 2016 nonfiction film to address Fox News and Newsmax addictions. Not calling for organized rally points and prioritizing forest-level changes.

Instead, it is bark at Americans, bark within the simulacra systems as conditioned by Putin. Tree after tree, simulation of Twitter message after Twitter message in the Reddit audience. Following the hive mind flocking, not standing up for change towards goodness, following right into MAGA values / Putinism media ecology mindsets.

https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/1q1clj4/to_not_admit_to_human_trafficking/nx4mcyn/

This whole posting is simulacra of resistance. Comments like this think they are out-smarting the name-calling of [Trump "low I.Q." "horce-face" (non-person) and other dog-whistle dehumanization](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-long-history-calling-women-crazy-attacking-appearances/story?id=48348956)... but they have all *adopted* it. It's the most powerful system of control. Surkov student techniques have defeated the nation. All people are truly deeply concerned about is their attraction to insulting and mocking. They have no desire to end the mocking because it is the stimulation that Putin has fed the nation since March 2013 and they find it thrilling. It's constantly exhausting translating all the nicknames and in-jokes and morphing Trump-speak MAGA-speak that Reddit society flocks to.

Top popular comment. Tiny-short think Tweet-length Musk messaging values. "She" choose to pick deporting people who she dislikes. Egoism, anti-Pluribus values. Now the hive mind of Reddit and fandom have adopted the Putin programmed / immigrant Elon Musk "woke mind virus" programming of praising and cheering on deportation, block-happy, deport-happy USA. 

It's all MAGA values all the time now. People hand-wave "both sides", but do not in any way articulate Russian Information Warfare methods "Internet Research Agency" programming and Rupert Murdoch programming of audiences. Fiction vs. fiction is not "both sides", it's simulations of resistance. There is 99.999999999% in fiction addiction, there is no "two sides" ("bothsides-ism") logic here, there is an abandonment of goodness in favor of punishing with deportation. Punishing with deportation is March 2013 onward MAGA values. Going after women is MAGA values.

Prizing deport as punishment is Putinsim since year 2013. "a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult—to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo. We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone’s protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years—and if you’re going on for your Ph. D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection." - 1988, Power of Myth

This isn't just *any* simulation here. Twitter messages are programming the Reddit audience to prize hate. That's hard-core MAGA year 2013 programming for the Internet Research Agency that keeps echoing / repeating / retweeting over and over in loops! People are behaving just like MAGA in January 2026, programmed to prize hate and find joy in the suffering of other people. This is hard-core mind-fuck programming, the deepest year renewal symbolism to *hate harder* USA.

Machine message programming of audiences on Reddit touch devices. That's the ARG here, hate humans, love Twitter power to express hate at high speed instant light-speeds. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuuObGsB0No 91,862,547 views August 29, 2013

I honestly just can't take this any more. Front page of Reddit. People are humor-washing, entertainment-washing, artificial intelligence praising, dreaming they could tweak him fatter in the AI video. 

The experience of being media awake to Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and the rise of MAGA. People are so attracted to MAGA images. The 2025 South Park entertainment of MAGA, this video. It isn't even just one person, Trump.

Neil Postman already wrote the book, and I did everything speaking in the streets that this was Trump's power. And Time magazine published it last fall too, and people just keep feeding the desires for more and more fiction content. Fiction of watching White House dance. Trump shares these fiction videos himself. Because he knows mobs of Reddit and Twitter will rush to it and drown out Neil Postman.

What really bothers me now is that the bar is so low, the slightest non-Trump leader will be ruled. And the Pluribus hive mind concept will never have taken off. Carl Sagan's 1995 book really was right. And my hopes (the Elvis song in Pluribus trailer of hope) is gone. Social media addictions, what Neil Postman described, created this Trump invading nations. People prize mocking at him as fat. that's it. Like they prize mocking people as dumb and stupid. It's not teaching. And when you promote teaching, as Malala did back in year 2012 and year 2013, it gets ignored.

* [Timeline of Donald Trump being center of attention vs. Malala's girls, young people (millions, not just one Malala) being center of attention year 2012 onward](/PostMalala/Marriage/World_Malala_Timeline_Year_2012.md)

* "The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

This was correct in year 1995, and we are living in the outcomes of that. And Carl Sagan people listened to, but *still*... the Apple iPhone in year 2007 set prizing of tiny-short dancing Trump, or dancing whoever is next, entertainment. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1q3vnsi/canadian_officials_say_us_health_institutions_no/nxoe74f/

Tiny-short Twitter-length thinking. Twitter-bird repeating, parroting, of Russian information warfare talking points. Blame millions of USA people, do everything and anything to not blame Kremlin information warfare. Never ever ever mention this book author's name on Reddit, and his 3 books since year 2014.

* “The display, which was called **'Can Democracy Survive the Internet?'** was dedicated to a 'global election management' company called Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica claimed to have gathered 5,000 data points on every American voter online: what you liked and what you shared on social media; how and where you shopped; who your friends were... They claimed to be able to take this imprint of your online self, use it to understand your deepest drives and desires, and then draw on that analysis to change your voting behaviour. The boast seemed to be backed up by success: Cambridge Analytica had worked on the victorious American presidential campaign of Donald Trump; it had also run successful campaigns for US Senator Ted Cruz (twice); and others all across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

Russia has gotten deep into the minds with entertainment. Not just voting days, but every upvote and retweet.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1q3yjp2/his_past_has_shown_exactly_that/nxoy7n2/

Reddit audiences will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING but turn to Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and focus on it every day (every 6 hours) until it is memorized or whatnot. And LOOK AT REDDIT through the Neil Postman 1985 perspective and Brave New World 1930's perspective. And sober up from the meme-think garbage learning. Anti-learning. People are not resisting it, they are incredibly attracted to Fox News HDTV and White House Antics to mock and talk about. It is exactly what Postman was saying about second term President in year 1985!!!

2. Dumb shit vs. dumb shit

3. Reddit audience eats this shit up. EVERY TIME from MAGA shit.

4. Thrilled at how amusing it is to watch their nation be dumb and stupid

5. Reddit meme fandom (Twitter message fandom too) of how glorious it is that the White House provides such mockery. "associated with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) is Linda McMahon, who became the U.S. Secretary of Education in March 2025 under President Trump, bringing her business background (including leading WWE) into the role, aligning with a focus on school choice and parental rights in education."

&nbsp;

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

Front page of Reddit. Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, a real estate investor, property investor. This is propaganda on Reddit to cheer on the wealthy 1% who own everything in USA and to imprison people who need a bed to sleep in in USA so that more Trump golf courses and Trump hotels and Trump need to take over Canada and Greenland because real estate profits are more important than human beings needing food. Stealing food from homeless people, poisoning their home life, intimidating them with guns and weapons. MAGA NRA values, Russian NRA values. Reddit users / Reddit audience cheers on the lords of property owners that all vote for and worship Rupert Murdoch, Trump, Bill Gates landowner.  

This is what the Internet Research Agency has done to the mindsets of the nation since March 2013. Praising kings of land, like Putin taking over Ukraine land because Russia's vast amounts of land are never enough! All housing and land must pay taxes to Trump and Putin in the world. Reddit thinks this is awesome because it's clever, and Trump is clever and Putin is clever.

A police-cop or I.C.E. or landlord-raider of the homeless is cheered on by Reddit audiences. ICE raids are cool awesome content for meme addicts on their intimate touch iPhone and iPad to cheer on the wealth lords of USA year 2026! Poor troubled people, *fuck the poor*, cheer on the super-rich people who own thousands of houses for money-making off people they pay to raid like ICE raids. Because this guy is so clever with the eating of all the food, "hate thy neighbor" like Trump is organizing hate mobs against Canada.  Reddit users prize video and clever over all else. Just like was described in year 1951, not very long after year 1944. Second Bill of Rights January 1944, mocked, because that isn't clever live video for meme addicts on Reddit!

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark about "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

It happened one time before, with a second-term POTUS year 1985:

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Low-effort tiny-short Reddit commenting to call leaders { dumb, stupid, idiot, moron }. Over and over for more than 11 years and 6 months. Every day, calling people stupid. No book quotes, no education or teaching, just simulating a resistance by insulting and mocking. Followers of Trump's lead of social media: turn all commenting and ideas into stupid-prizing. Surkov won.

Because this is what appeals to Reddit audiences. Simulation of resistance. A cartoon image, a X / Twitter screen shot. A low-effort mockery back and fort, feedback looping of mock for mock. A game loop. Gamers, sports gaming in rectangle predictable images on a screen, screen gaming, video gaming. Chidlren raised since 1979 with Atari systems, Nintendo, Playstation from Sony. Everything is simulation and cartoon images and logic prized above all else. Simple-think, Twitter is the richest man in the entire world feeding insincere content to Reddit audience. Fiction outselling nonfiction.

The branding of this as "MURDER!!!!! By WORDS!!!!" is the very falsehoods and lies Reddit audiences flock to. Elon Musk Twitter, Truth Social (fiction content), Fox News, memes and junk information is what people seek out to give low-effort commenting. The population using free time, spare time, spent **avoiding progressive use of information systems** repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev, Bill Moyers }. This is the top of the commenting page, the most prized comment! Low-effort Tweet-length anti-learning. Marshall McLuhan understanding is lost in memeland society. This is Trump's extreme power, to make people prize low bar of measure, television and meme entertainment above all else in leadership systems.

A laugh-track message for Reddit audiences to find it entertaining and amusing that they are being manipulated. Comedy-wrapping, Comedy-washing, sane-washing via humor mind-blowing. Meme addicts eating out of the hands of the meme providers. This isn't resisting, this is cheering on how "dumb" the others are when democracy does not work when everyone just calls others dumb and ignores seriously deep education from Marshall McLuhan since the 1950's.

* "the nature of American politics as a permanent campaign has become deeply rooted. Worse, the campaign is not only permanent but also increasingly polarized along partisan lines, and that polarization extends to nearly every aspect of governance. Much of the blame for this state of affairs resides with Newt Gingrich, 33 the mastermind of the 1994 Republican Revolution. Prior to Gingrich's ascent, the Republican minority leader, Robert H. Michel, operated under the quaint idea that the minority party had a responsibility to work with the majority to solve problems and to forge compromises ( where possible ) to further" - page 30 / page 31

In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. **We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth**. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a **perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; a culture-death is a clear possibility.

Using comedy television show to meme-wrap MAGA and Trump as impossible to defeat. Abandon impeachment efforts, use social media to promote for-profit television entertainment! ANYTHING and EVERYTHING on Reddit to avoid asserting Dr. Bandy X Lee and her nonfiction serious books about the problems. Just meme away and don't stand up for serious intelligent people who write important books on the crisis!

* "There is no question but that Hitler belongs in the category of the truly mystic medicine man. As somebody commented about him at the last Nürnberg party congress, since the time of Mohammed nothing like it has been seen in this world. His body does not suggest strength. The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer. This markedly mystic characteristic of Hitler's is what makes him do things which seem to us illogical, inexplicable, and unreasonable. ... So you see, Hitler is a medicine man, a spiritual vessel, a demi-deity or, even better, a myth." - Doctor Carl G Jung. During an interview with H. R. Knickerbocker, first published in Hearst's International Cosmopolitan (**January 1939**), in which Jung was asked to diagnose Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin

People are in denial that Trump is first and foremost a media icon, a symbol of media content, and people blow their minds out on media messages! Fox News HDTV audience crisis, the purchase of Twitter media by Elon Musk, Facebook alternate realities, etc. Since March 2013, Russia has been waging an information war against NATO and USA!

A dozen subreddits all proclaim this as the important topic to rally around! In no way is this resisting Trump, this is Trump playing the bad guy and audiences reacting. This is President Tony Clifton performing for his fandoms. Hate leadership / readership fandom, deep symbol gumbo of American POTUS + FORD + shit-talking keys.

Fox News HDTV problem isn't taken seriously, Jen Senko's nonfiction film not cited nearly enough. Dr. Bandy X Lee since early 2017 barely given any pubic attention. While sex monster Epstein is given nonstop repeating as important name, not even for change or arrest, just for "information list", Q Drop / QAnon style information pursuit.

The adult men who admire and follow and consume Joe Rogan as a product and "experience" are far more concern than Joe Rogan himself. That people consider his content as something to follow and learn from. There are so many topics to study and analyze in this world, and Joe Rogan is an attraction to religion-like clergy for billionaires. Like Rupert Murdoch's fandom / audiences.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qcn9ga/that_will_show_them/nzjb78q/

They aren't "offended", they are aggressively blocking the media. Social media blocking, deporting, self-deporting, bullying away people they disagree with. It is information war, the film itself, the message egoism and egomania. It is a symptom of **information overload**, diversity, and incredibly popular on Bluesky and Reddit to **announce you are burning books, burning films, deleting film, blocking a human person with ICE**. Just like wrecking other animals or plant life on Earth, destruction. Anti-diversity, anti-goodness.

Screen shot of Musk Twitter on Reddit, this is simulation of resistance. The comments are Twitter-length tweet-think binary logic. The saddest think is Reddit audience thinks it is *winning*... by repeating MAGA phrase "snowflake" throughout the comment section. That's MAGA year 2015 behavior that is now everyone USA behavior year 2026. Anti-education, anti-teaching. Just bonfire of the Tweet-think mind patterns that the IRA conditioned since March 2013. (Bonfire of education, teaching, goodness). 

* German-Jewish poet Heinrich Heine: "Where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people also" (or "Where they burn books, they will, in the end, burn human beings too"). Originally from his **year 1821** play *Almansor*.. because of the Bible book driven *Spanish Inquisition*. People who believe there is one and only one perfect book in the entire public library: The Bible science fiction book with magical outer-space pregnancy of a virgin woman. Gullibility to confuse fiction with nonfiction. Film burning on Apple TV+ may not require flame and paper, but it is book burning. They did not have films in Germany in year 1821 for people to burn as physical media.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qcn9ga/that_will_show_them/nzjeln7/

Reddit tells anti-MAGA how to think. Fiction vs. fiction. Avengers is fiction storytelling. Bible is fiction storytelling. clergy vs. clergy. 

Following what other people tell you to think isn't a problem if it is goodness. All getting on the same page f a good ideas is not a threat. All commenting on different trees of messages on Reddit and avoiding Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and leadership since year 2017 is a terrible behavior and terrible thinking.

Because billionaires advertise on Reddit media and people do not want to confront media ecology. Marshall McLuhan education and teaching from University of Toronto has been abandoned to the general public. Billionaires have ensured that Marshall McLuhan's 1970' public education is not applied to Rupert Murdoch's public education systems since October 7, 1996. Media ecology is the absent education in a working healthy democracy. Reddit user is calling out the problem but not offering education and teaching and learning **for adults** as a solution. We can rescue USA from Putin's Internet Research Agency... if we stop commenting all on different pages of Reddit and get on serious important topics, *the same page*.

This is over 10 years old, why is it not well know as subreddit vs. subreddit, filter-bubble education of self-awareness? 

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

Eating out of Putin's hands. Eating out of Twitter owner Elon Musk hands in his HQ of Austin, Texas. Eating out of Rupert Murdoch hands. It's scripted Reality TV fiction in the public streets. Mock vs. mock. Reddit audience eats it up, an enemy to hate upon! Would not want to use Reddit to promote Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction book on paper to stand up to the media crisis of people parroting Fox News and mind-fucked by Putin. Also note **this is not a 79 year old man with dementia** saying the same lines MAGA is saying all over the nation. This is the outcome of mass mind manipulation.

To keep everybody in the helpless state engendered by prolonged mental rutting" - [University of Toronto; Marshall McLuhan](/Art/ScreenPlay/Mental_Rutting/Public_Helplessness.md)

This is what has gone on for over 10 years. Social media audiences avoiding standing up and asserting goodness. Mocking MAGA is not resisting MAGA, the MAGA person MOCKED FIRST! Total Mockery is what the audience is engaging, a society where mocking itself is wrecking goodness. Lead by the Reality TV star that mocks nonfiction science and book reading.

* "elaborated in a follow-up interview, “Trump creates his own **extreme manipulation of reality**. He insists that his spokesmen defend his false reality **as normal**. He then expects the rest of society to accept it — despite the lack of any evidence.” This leads to what Lifton calls “malignant normality” — in other words, the **gradual acceptance by a public inundated with toxic untruths** of those untruths until they pass for normal.”

Put down memes and animal toys / images, and actually ask for professional help on cult deporgramming.

Media addicts have been sitting on their ass waiting for this episode of the Reality White House / Reality Kremlin TCP/IP media show to stream to the intimate touch-device screens. No call to stand up to the media crap Trump keeps dropping into the mounts of the Reddit audience. Instead, just commenting like it is a television show or film or sports game to gawk at.

This Reddit messaging **is calling Trump "mentally ill" in low-effort** comment style (very popular on Reddit January 2026) that people find "engaging" / "engagement" to Trump topics. Reddit profits off this... addicts to mocking Trump. Addicts to calling Trump "mentally ill" without actually asking We The People to *come together* to remove Trump leadership. No off-Reddit URL, no doctors cited, no books quoted. This is inside the billionaire media systems, Reddit, to just comment and not educate and teach intelligent intellectual serious topics.

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests — and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark about "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland.

Just tiny-short high-speed messaging simulation of "resistance" via Reddit cloud computing servers. There is no information to address the cult crisis!

NYC, right in NYU Neil Postman's realm of explaining why all this is NOT RESISTING Fox News HDTV. You don't "LOL" at NYC Fox News outcomes, that's being mentally owned into predictable amusement patterns (Title of Neil Postman's 1985 book). Extremely predictable mindset of slavish reactionary entertainment travel behaviors and Twitter behaviors. 

The way you RESIST is educate. You get out Neil Postman's thin 184 page book and you start teaching. You get every person on the same page. We The People on the same 184 pages. And you put an end to { mocking, mockery, total mockery, LOL, amusement, entertainment } about serious matters through comprehension of this mind / brain behavior. New York University still probably has a copy of Postman's dusty old books in the library. On paper.

Reddit is the Trump fandom. PAY ATTENTION HERE: A speech, distributed by media networks (TCP/IP Internet medium) made by President Donald J. Trump is the trigger for this topic. Trump is the SOURCE of something to comment about. That's the media ecology perspective of Trump the entertainer, actor, President *Tony Clifton* performances. The more odd, unusual, errors and wild claims he makes, the more Reddit audience falls in line (and the Twitter media empire screenshot mocking away).

Spare time and free time is consumed to engage Trump's shit. Hey, I like the language discussion and learning, but TRUMP is leading it! Leading us all into Tower of Babel hate. Out-group hate immigrants mind-fucking of Surkov students. Antics politics. REDDIT society is not resisting this and is a FANDOM of "making the best jokes" of Trump, making the best of a horrible Trump situation. But that's the problem. The same free time and spare time could be used to comment over and over and over: Dr. Bandy X Lee and quotes from her October 3, 2017 book. It is the avoidance of relevant nonfiction books (on paper) that is my media ecology emphasis of the Reddit audience / fandoms to Trump.

If some of this lecture has seemed a little weird or to go a little too far, it’s because I don’t want to reduce quite all of this to slogans. On the other hand, I don’t want it to not be funny, because part of the postmodern trajectory itself is **a rather humorous joke on the human race** which laboured for millennia to reduce working hours in order to produce leisure so we could enjoy this **very leisure that then turns in a kind of vengeful act against us absorbing our leisure time**, which was to be our living time, into time now spent ***in the service of what can only be called this inhuman spectacle***.

Yes, this post is resisting, but resisting WHAT? Exactly what is being resisted? A super-ignorant low-bar taunting message from an actor, acting! Donald Trump is a comedian entertainer. People love and adore and worship jokes about how { dumb, stupid, moron, idiot } Trump is. Do you know how many fucking times Trump has been messages in his life that he is an IDIOT? HE KNOWS! 

The crowd on Reddit, on the other hand, does NOT KNOW "Tony Clifton" performance style of NYC (Trump Home Town) Saturday Night Live (SNL)! Reddit audience is being BAMBOOZLED!

Trump does not CARE about mistakes and errors and mental exceptions, because they all draw the crowd in! It is all a manipulation technique. Russian: Putin and Surkov, for the past 25 years! Surkov governing techniques and methods!

1995, wake up, again YEAR 1995. Repeating: 1995. “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241

THE EVIDENCE REDDIT SOCIETY IS AVOIDING AND REJECTING: October 20, 2011. COUNT THE YEARS. LONG BEFORE the November 2016 election: https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin

Donald Trump is first and foremost: A celebrity. A TV star. A Reality Television star and actor! Acting!

MORE EVIDENCE REDDIT SOCIETY IS AVOIDING AND REJECTING: Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

Denial abounds. Reddit audience can't see that there has been no Reddit uprising the entire 10 years and 7 months Trump has been the center of all USA media systems, enter of Reddit audience attention. Media addiction confrontation.

Reddit audience is waiting for I.C.E. / Pentagon / MAGA / Fox News / Musk Twitter / Truth Social / Trump images every hour of every day. To react-comment. ANYTHING but face mind-fucking learning and education. The dehumanization caused by digital media systems.

Why haven't "The Media", the **social media companies** (Reddit and Bluesky) pinned educational posts to people and informed their users to see the *forest for the trees* of how:

1. "But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A **ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable** because it is undefinable." - [Adam Cutis, year 2014](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html)

2. "The brilliance of this new type of authoritarianism is that instead of simply oppressing opposition, as had been the case with twentieth-century strains, it **climbs inside all ideologies and movements, exploiting and rendering them absurd.**" - [Peter Pomerantsev, 2014](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8035579.Peter_Pomerantsev)

Reddit is the advanced, hard level, of the simulation of resistance. Where poop diaper and orange skin is prized shit-content over all else. Quotes from nonfiction books about **cult deprogramming** and group mental health and Kremlin information warfare do not get pushed on Reddit to the top.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1qm7v6j/public_opinion_shifts_on_ice_as_advocates_warn_of/o1k758b/

This is simulation of resistance. Trump is telling the Reddit audience exactly what the Reddit audience already believes: "Always follow the money", the blind and never-questioned faith that money motivates all terrorism. That being paid money is the motivation for terrorist. It just is not true. Rupert Murdoch does not PAY MONEY to his audience of Fox News. the mot loyal voters and killers are those who believe in fiction story telling. The Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon are all science FICTION stories. And fandom of the fantasy stories PAY MONEY to the Temple, Mosque, Synagogue, Church, cinema, venue. People pay for fiction. People are attracted to fiction. 

Donald Trump is creating a fiction that protesters are motivate by payment an money. Reddit is attracted to this fiction storytelling. People are eating right out of the hands of Surkov students. The answer is to teach cult deprogramming, to not just say "cult", but actually start heating nonfiction books about cults.

You better teach hard and stand up for what you believe in. Education of authentic learning and teaching about flaws in the human mind. Because the Roman Empire in year 380 adopted science fiction Bible as a way to lead a society - and the USA in year 2026 still has science fiction church venues all over the nation. Fox News fiction storytelling, Newsmax fiction storytelling, Reddit fiction storytelling still outsells any kind of nonfiction Wikipedia or nonfiction in general.

The Twitter screen shot made top of /r/All on Reddit. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to LOL "Murdered, by Words!" amused at the ICE situations. The fandom of ICE on Reddit. People cheering on their favorite Internet commenting creators. ANYTHING but turn to nonfiction cult deprogramming. AVOIDING: Dr. Bandy X. Lee nonfiction book, promoting Dr. Lee as a leader out of this situation. There is zero self-awareness that people are in a mob mentality, crowd, FOLLOWING Trump and Putin's leadership since March 2013. Surkov won.

Trivia of a fan spotting someone famous off a Twitter screen shot. Perpetual rounds of mocking and LOL at MAGA USA, Trump's entertainment for Reddit fandom (hate leaders, and hate-seeking followers who hate ICE, Putin and Trump baiting the whole audience with high-speed media systems). Reddit cultural life, sitting in an audience watching Trumpism. This is a simulation, this isn't resisting, it's commenting upon Trump's constantly stimulating leadership actions and players.

* “When a population becomes **distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round** of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

Reddit audience upvotes Charlie Kirk content over and over since his death. The attraction to the nonsense is keeping people from facing the mental health problems of MAGA and Donald Trump. Dr. Bandy X Lee being on the front page is far more important and urgent than Erika Kirk and Charlie Kirk. Reddit is the AUDIENCE to this garbage. Mocking it is not resisting it.

The Reddit posting, the image / screenshot. This is not NEW. Billionaires have adopted what the Catholic Church did. 1. Church did not pay Taxes, it COLLECTED them as fees for Bible science fiction. Just like HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon, Apple TV+, Sports Teams owner billionaires, Taylor Swift video charges FEES to see science fiction stories. The Church. 2) Secrets to sell ads, that's what CONFESSION is - secret peer to peer intelligence gathering about "sin" so the Clergy can use that to sell and collect money on Sunday topic.

What we have is a failure to study Marshall McLuhan, media ecology, the ecological behavior of media systems - social media users on January 2026 do not recognize that The Church in year 1750 was doing the SAME THING, "Old World Order". Mecca does the same thing in Saudi Arabia leadership, "Old World Order" that year 1776 is trying to address. The Founding Fathers Free Masons understood this, but today in year 2026 after 250 years, we have failed to keep up with this comprehension of how the Clergy uses science fiction storytelling to rule a population. Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman's teachings are essential reformation in year 2026!

Instead of using social media ACTIVELY to address the cult issues of Fox News HDTV media, cult issues of Trump hate-watching fandoms... wait around and be entertained until one person dies.

The Twitter image is a BLATANT example of simulation of resistance. Back and forth Tweet-thinking tiny-short patterns. Over and over and over in gaming loops. Game loop machine media Tweeting. An alternate reality gaming media enviornment (ARG media politics, Surkovian / Surkov). "END OF THE DEBATE" nonsense, the issue is MEDIA ECOLOGY EDUCATION. **This REDDIT-TWITTER INTERACTION is NOT A DEBATE**!!!

* "I mean, these are papers that you could legitimately expect people to write if they still read or wrote. Not many people still do either – read or write, much – but in any case; reduction of complexity. **Let’s look at political parties** for a moment. The Republicans with their great traditions have come up with a slogan of incredible sophistication: “No more tax and spend”. Now **any you who can quack that one out could be a Republican. And I am using that in the Orwellian sense of “quack”; you don’t need to engage higher brain functions**. All you have to do is say “Don’t take my money, and don’t spend it… well, except on me and my friends, but don’t tax and spend”. Now it’s not that the Democrats are doing any better, I don’t guess that’s news." ... "But the Democrat’s response to this “tax and spend” is “No we don’t, nah nah na-nah nah: invest” **This is political debate in a democracy. No it’s not. It’s the simulation of politics. Ross Perot is not leading a movement. It is a simulation** of a movement, follow me?" - Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University. https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Every media site commenting section is now interactive fiction (IF), touch screen filter-bubble games. An alternate reality gaming environment where people crave fiction and mythology (monomyth chunks and patterns) and have abandoned sustained focus "we all need to get on the *same page together*" nonfiction serious important topics.

* “We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to **cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do**. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to **exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition**? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 12 "Revelations", page 235, year 2019

Calling a NYC man, born in New York, fan of SNL NYC, "a clown" is not resisting. Trump is playing Tony Clifton comedy acts and stunts for the camera, all the time, for the Reddit fandom. Mocking Trump as "a clown" is not resisting a Tony Clifton act. You resist a Tony Clifton actor, Trump, but asserting nonfiction education by Dr. Bandy X Lee. A non-clown serious mental health expert who has been leading since year 2017 - but Reddit commenting community won't stop mocking and insulting Donald Trump's on-camera performance.

And **MAGA is not one single 79 year-old clown**. It is hundreds of millions of people. Fox News HDTV audience cult has the same media addition issues as Reddit shit-commenting media cultists. Anti-intellectual mocking of serious people like Dr. Bandy X Lee's book.

Reddit "I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson" Television fandom is fucking entirely blind that Putin is the one playing 16D chess since March of year 2013! Over and over the Reddit comment section is entertained by Trump behavior and Trump antics as Donald Trump plays POTUS Tony Clifton. The Reddit fandom of antics and jokes and television "Reality TV The Apprentice" eats it up. People can not face up to this **January of year 2015** story that explains the 16D Chess game and who is playing it. Reddit audience can not follow basic strategy game (Chess) timelines, minds are blown by shit comedy television Tony Clifton show every day into meme stupors. This is not resisting, this is mocking-away the USA to Russia's media television audience (Tim Robinson fandom) information warfare since this was published:

He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1quo3iv/50_cent_mocks_nicki_minajs_x_rampage_as_critics/o3bgxkv/

1. Mocking is not resisting a Tony Clifton actor doing his acting of POTUS Clifton.

2. Mocking a total mockery nation is adding to the overdose of mockery.

3. Anti-Mocking is sobering up and promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction education and teaching every day on Reddit commenting section. EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY.

4. Anti-Mockery is promoting Jen Senko about Fox News brainwashing and cult.

5. Adding hate to a hate leader Trump is following Trump. Hate leadership is working. Putin leads Trump.

There is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, have **barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality**. Those who have written vigorously on the matter tell us, for example, that what is happening is the residue of an exhausted capitalism; or, on the contrary, that it is the tasteless fruit of the maturing of capitalism; or that it is the neurotic aftermath of the Age of Freud; or the retribution of our allowing God to perish; or that it all comes from the old stand-bys, greed and ambition.

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by **technological diversions**. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

* Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

Top-upvoted comment. Twitter-length short-message mindset. Eating right out of the hands of the Kremlin and White House. This is a Reddit community eating the Surkovian onions. Eating the Onion. Incredibly gullible Reddit audience that will not turn to Dr. Bandy X. Lee or Peter Pomerantsev teaching and education. SEE: https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md

Every hour of every day, Reddit is sane-washing JD Vance, hundreds of millions of MAGA cult members, Putin, Trump, Elon Musk. Over and over, Reddit falls for the same **antics politics** and entirely misses the point of why **over-dramatic antics** are constantly appearing on the front page of /r/All by the White House. 

Reddit users have been manipulated and targeted by the Internet Research Agency.. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 Useful Idiots is the term that Russia uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot (not my insult, I strive pretty hard to write things like "avoids nonfiction learning" and "unable to focus on using Google Search and finding Peter Pomerantsev's information if you want a better-quality writing than my shit English. Calling people banal "idiot" is even something Marshall McLuhan addressed https://youtu.be/2JIj0Bqbdhk?t=156 in one of his filmed interviews. It is a thought-terminating cliché.).

.

1. Putin, MAGA, White House, Musk does some bold antics action
2. Reddit audience posts image, quote, or mocking of the antics
3. Reddit community sane-washes the situation by prizing it as entertainment and amusement

4. Reddit members crack-jokes to sanewash the USA society in total. That this is just "Internet culture" of how people have fun. Jokes, falsehoods, fictions, make-up scenarios, make-up quotes, mirroring Trump's writing style, talking about skin color (brown, black, orange). Make fan-fiction about the situation.

5. ALWAYS avoided: Peter Pomerantsev's writing, videos, etc. Questioning the pattern witnessed over and over. Pondering and questioning: **if maybe the crowds that gather every single day to mock and insult Trump aren't a form of intentional population control**. Imprisoned fandom...compulsive brainwashing into always joking and always mocking and always hating MAGA and Trump.
  
6. ALWAYS avoiding: reflecting on what Donald Trump actually is good at. Instead of listing all of Trump's failures: bankruptcy list, divorce and failed marriages, TACO trade deals, failed Trump university / steak seller / on and on. **FACE THE ONE THING Trump is known for grifting, tricking, actor, acting, acting like an actor. An actor who is faking being an actor, a grift of acting itself. Entertainer, Reality TV**. Like Trump is playing in the film "Jackass" as a character for an audience. Trump's **ONE GOOD SKILL is getting on camera every 90 minutes of every day** and rage-bating Reddit!

.

Repeating number 5: ... pondering... Are we living inside a Reddit video game of [grinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_\(video_games\)) away sane-washing jokes and behaving not as political actors, but an audience to a Reality TV theater and circus performances? Does Trump behave like a fiction character, President Tony Clifton of SNL NYC? Are we gullible and falling for the acting of a Tony Clifton actor? Are we "eating the onion" just like Fox News audience does in red states / rural population and not recognizing that **Fox News is a fiction entertainment show** like SNL Weekend Update?

* “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

THE SIMULATION: **"You can smell the fear from here"** (this Reddit comment being linked)

THE REALITY: "Those media addicts will do anything to put on a show, and American MAGA eats it up. 40 cars is over the top, antics to get on the front page of Reddit, and look, it is on the top front page of /r/All"

THE REALITY: The **only "fear" they** have is that their acts and antics and investments in 40 cars doesn't have a film audience to the blockbuster show. That it doesn't dominate the headlines like a new Taylor Swift song release.

IF YOU ARE MAKING ENTERTAINMENT: Borat film or Jackass film, taking ICE to Italy is right up pp your ally of antics entertainment.

.

There is no self-awareness in the Reddit audience. The Reddit is reading The Onion and falling hook, line and sinker that it is "fear" and not in fact **political theater, entertainment politics**, Surkovian.
