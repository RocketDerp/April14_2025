Note to self:

For year 2026 start...

I am trying to always link a comment. Currently the Python script targets comments and not posting links.

Maybe I should revise the Python script, but for now, I'm changing things.

In 2025B - I was targeting postings without using the Python script at all to capture saves of the pages for some commentary. such as the Simulacra of Resistance topic.

P.S. Yes, "Simulacra (singular: simulacrum)" I am capable of learning. But I like how "Simulacras" (plural) sounds. When they are joyful and fun, simulations and simulacras can be cool! "The plural of samba is sambas, following standard English rules for adding '-s' to form plurals for countable nouns, referring to multiple instances of the lively Brazilian dance or music." OPERA_A "Donald Fagen's 1982 solo album The Nightfly, this song about the Cuban revolution features a "sprightly" samba rhythm. The track has been professionally arranged in a Latin Samba style for other performers" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_dCarcpRjw 3,251 views June 9, 2017
