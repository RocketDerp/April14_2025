COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING - we have taken free thinking and mythology science fiction understanding for granted. We keep thinking religion conflicts (sconce fiction vs. science fiction, Quran vs. Bible of 9/11, September 11 2001) are behind us. Torah science fiction vs. Quran science fiction fandoms of October 7, 2023 Palestine. We keep ignoring the cult behaviors of science fictions storytelling, Fox News televangelism fiction. Donald Trump does what no other President in USA history does so well: Charming fiction storytelling. Trump creates wild storytelling that USA media consumers flock to, like flies to smelly shit. The abandonment of free-thinking science in favor of fiction storytelling that Trump creates playing the POTUS Tony Clifton fiction character and Surkov student fiction screenplays.

TRUMP_FANDOM Reddit commenting community. A photograph of Donald Trump gets upvoted to the front-page of /r/All Reddit constantly all the time, over and over, images of Reality TV celebrity Donald Trump to the cult media venue Reddit app. CLICKBAIT_TITLE with non-specific generic teasing of content that gets you to see the photograph of Donald Trump because the title on Reddit community is manipulation. 

This entire posting is a gullible Reddit fandom of Trump. Consumers of "The Apprentice" Reality TV who can't grasp this is part of the POTUS Tony Clifton character and Surkov student screenplays! WHITE_HOUSE_REALITY_WARFARE_FICTION_AVOIDING_NONFICTION_ON_WARFARE - this is organized information warfare since March of year 2013, and Reddit users in February 2026 still eat it up without being able to **cite serious nonfiction** on the subject! It is not enough to just call out one tree, bark at one tree, and not recognize (self-awareness) Reddit is living in a forest! The inability to cite common **on the same page** nonfiction books on paper is the crisis! This is Putin-Trump power! 

1. From September 9, 2014 which is 11 years 5 months and some 2 weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's capure of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. **It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action."

PROMOTING_IGNORANCE_WORKS_PLAYING_DUMB_MOCKING There are FAR MORE IMPORTANT NONFICTION topics to be promoting on social media, such as: Jen Senko nonfiction, Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction, Neil Postman nonfiction! PUT AN END TO TRUMPISM, **please stop** LIVING in the toxic ocean of Trump junk mindsets!

ANSWER: The addiction to commenting about politicians on media systems, celebrity fandom, is what is driving society now. What exactly do people believe Donald Trump's talent and gift to be? I see a Reality TV star, a media influencer, and a nation of media cults. Do people think he is a good business man? I think he has a charming personality that charms the pants off men, charms women into supporting nasty aggressive men (like Epstein, Elon Musk), charms money out of people, charms power out of people. A media personality, an actor who is acting a Tony Clifton performance with Surkov students boosted screenplays... TRUMP_CHARMING_ACTOR_ACTING 

"Why do so many people make their entire personality about someone who does not know they exist?" ANSWER: This is an age old problem, we can name it, The Bible verse "1 John 4:20" problem. It is a CRISIS that Bible verse "1 John 4:20" spelled out 2,000 years ago! One of the most printed books in all human history. but people have such a BIBLE_LITERACY problem they can't grasp this very fundamental behavior topic. "people make their entire personality about someone who does not know they exist" - ***have you seen Jesus? Have you seen God?*** - Bible verse "1 John 4:20" https://BibleHub.com/1_john/4-20.htm 

Why oh why on why can't we all turn to "1 John 4:20" SAME_PAGE_SAME_TIME_SAME_UNDERSTANDING and grasp HOW LONG this crisis has been GOING ON! OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhw472vpjtg 83 views February 19, 2026 Lyrics: "Well, **if friends with their fancy persuasion don't admit** that it's part of **a scheme**! But I can't help but have my suspicions... 'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem" - Bible verse "1 John 4:20" repurposed song meaning... HAVE YOU SEEN GOD?

"It’s a humanity issue" - Reddit media comment 2026-02-25 morning USA. Yha, WHAT SPECIFIC HUMANITY ISSUE? Is the issue ignorance? Tiny-short Twitter-thinking Tweet-length 140 character mind patterns? What Carl Sagan described as **1.5 second sound bites** media messaging (like this MOST POPULAR low-information upvoters https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_information_voter Reddit media comment) in year 1995 before Twitter was launched July 15, 2006?

* “and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, year 1995, page 59

GUN_WORSHIP Fiction addicts cult vs. fiction addicts cult in no way addresses the Fox News HDTV cult problem. People have demonstrated during the pandemic that they are willing to due for nonsense. This was published BEFORE the pandemic:

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the [Plot to Break America, page 85](https://books.google.com/books?id=8OW2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85&dq=%22serves+as+a+political+uniform.+And+if+you+have+a+uniform,+you+have+an+army.%E2%80%9D&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X). **year 2019**

Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee's books on mental health voided by everyone on social media and "the media" (social media users who have time to post and comment) not promoting Dr. Lee's nonfiction books?

We are nearing February 28, 1954 Sunday Martin Luther King Jr lecture. Alas, people have such extreme RECENCY_BIAS they do not turn to writings and teaching before Trump consumed all information attention.

ANY_NATION_ANY_PEOPLES people in USA don't stand up for Ukraine, Russia under Putin, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran - why would ANYONE think that ANYONE would desire living in shit values? The ignorance displayed on Reddit that someone is "winning" living in hate. GARBAGE_IN_GARBAGE_OUT - Reddit community does not want to face how much Reddit community itself has changed since year 2012. Propaganda and advertising and marketing work and not standing up for goodness itself and thinking it is fine that others suffer is badness. The pandemic January 2020 was the wake-up call that there were no fire drill or teaching in school for a disease outbreak! Year 1918 pandemic was not a rumor, it was real history, yet people  are more prepared for the death party of Donald Trump than they are prepared for a disease outbreak. May as well prepare for Heaven after death like religion has had people doing for thousands of years when people can't see how predictable diseases are spreading. Never forget August 24, 2018 and the denial people have of the influence of Twitter https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

"bro they are NAZIS" this ignorance. So is Swat Valley Pakistan in December 2008 Nazi Germany? Before year 1933 - there was nothing worse or as bad as Nazi Germany? IGNORANCE_CELEBRATIONS The Native Americans / First Peoples in North America and South America - was that Nazi Germany? It is programmed into your mind that the BRAND_NAME of evil is what matters more than recognizing the indoctrination and programming. Fox News HDTV, why does nobody on Reddit promote and mention Jen Senko's film from year 2015?

"The MAGAts hate anyone who disagrees with them." - and the attackers on September 11, 2011 - 9/11 loved their enemy? HATE_THY_ENEMY preaching is all over Reddit. OUT_GROUP_HATE is Levant clergy values. Reddit users are unable to see the very education system of Reddit they are commenting on. People are so fixated on hate of Trump that their mind is corrupted in not seeing this as a universal education and teaching problem of human peoples anywhere in this world.

CALL_FOR_ACTION_TO_DO_TRIVIAL_CHANGE I'm pointing out the length of this comment. How simplistic. Trump is 79 years old, he is not a baby. Elon Musk is not a baby. Putin is not a baby. What the fuck does it accomplish other than your entertainment to call Trump a baby? You clearly can not face adult mind problems with ADULTS like GenX woman Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 that is sitting in every public library! This is Reddit comment using Twitter-thinking Tweet-programmed mindsets. Being "a baby" is generally considered innocent and morally uncorrupted, not responsible for crimes. You are baby-washing Trump as innocent of his actions, his PARENTS are responsible for taking care of a baby. Trump has no living parents!

"Oh, Sheryl Crow worked with Kid Rock one time, maybe she was trying offer goodness to Kid Rock and rescue him, but now I can not focus on the good thing she is sharing in February year 2026 because earlier she had a bad idea"... on and on. Her brand is forever and permanent bad source of ideas because process of elimination. NAME who to follow? Reddit user, NAME the list of values and person we should all listen to. I will name one: Dr. Bandy X Lee. NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH We should all get on the same page as Dr. Lee. Why sin't Sheryl Crow TODAY, TOMORROW, promoting Dr. Lee? Why isn't Stephen Colbert promoting Dr. Lee like advertising and repeating her name and books like advertising with his show?

14 day Reddit account. GIVE_UP_ANTI_EDUCATION_ANTI_TEACH_ANTI_PROGRESS Give up on goodness. Don't call for goodness, don't teach and educate goodness, just join in with MAGA_VALUES of hate and dehumanization. that's what machine-logic technology lust lovers on Reddit praise as morality. Just like the middle east hate for hate wars that clergy preach: that some magical outer-space source of love and compassion and not from human persons who teach and educate and share goodness itself. We the People are the source of love, and this Reddit comment is calling for MORE hate, more revenge, more MAGA values.

Reddit venue and Reddit commenting community:   
Reddit likes sharing photographs of Trump.   
Reddit likes and upvotes photographs of Trump.   
Reddit avoids Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction.   
Reddit believes simplistic tin-short message ideas are good and to create more.   
Reddit does not do a blackout to protest Epstein and Trump.   
Trump is one single person, and Reddit community puts this bad person on the front page hour after hour for over 10 years. Day after day.   
Reddit is a child-raping FANDOM of a child Rapist, Trump.    
Reddit is a venue for images of a child rapist.   
Reddit community often behaves as TRUMP_FANDOM that does not not communicate that it is BAD or show any moral judgement in saying "Trump raped underage girls." - just declares it in a simplistic, simple, matter of fact statement.   
I think Reddit is a rotten fandom of Trump images, Reddit is /r/CultReddit that is promoting Donald Trump for his sexual conquests, political conquests, wealth conquests. Why is Reddit not promoting and repeating over and over Dr. Bandy X Lee's assembled 27 people in her October 3, 2017 book?

Top-upvoted comment, fiction to wash down the reality of USA Trumpism. Not even a 2.5 second 140 character-length message. Welcome to Reddit /r/Technology where we lust and love for Technology to dehumanize people. We The People celebrate ignorance and celebrate the movie Idiocracy and the writer's other work: Beavis and Butthead. IGNORANCE_CELEBRATIONS 

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. **“Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential)** with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

ESSENTIAL_STUDY_MAGA what's absent: a name of a leader or name of a plan (like "Project 2025" name-dropping) to rally around to actually organize and stand up for goodness. I would suggest people use Dr. Bandy X Lee's name and mention it over and over and over when White House / MAGA topics are being discussed.

There is such a deep misunderstanding of what Putin's Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica have done to "Hearts and Minds". This is every hour of every day. Why are Reddit users NOT promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 leaders since October 3, 2017? ANSWER: hearts and minds are conditioned to self-harm the USA through simplistic symbolic thinking. Election day win is symbolic. The brain rot is EVERY HOUR of EVERY DAY.
