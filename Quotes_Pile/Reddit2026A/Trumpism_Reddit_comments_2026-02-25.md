COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING - we have taken free thinking and mythology science fiction understanding for granted. We keep thinking religion conflicts (sconce fiction vs. science fiction, Quran vs. Bible of 9/11, September 11 2001) are behind us. Torah science fiction vs. Quran science fiction fandoms of October 7, 2023 Palestine. We keep ignoring the cult behaviors of science fictions storytelling, Fox News televangelism fiction. Donald Trump does what no other President in USA history does so well: Charming fiction storytelling. Trump creates wild storytelling that USA media consumers flock to, like flies to smelly shit. The abandonment of free-thinking science in favor of fiction storytelling that Trump creates playing the POTUS Tony Clifton fiction character and Surkov student fiction screenplays. Americans eat it up. For all their faults, one thing the Founding Fathers of the USA had was free thinking. FREE_MASONS_FREE_THINKING_SELF_AWARENESS

TRUMP_FANDOM Reddit commenting community. A photograph of Donald Trump gets upvoted to the front-page of /r/All Reddit constantly all the time, over and over, images of Reality TV celebrity Donald Trump to the cult media venue Reddit app. CLICKBAIT_TITLE with non-specific generic teasing of content that gets you to see the photograph of Donald Trump because the title on Reddit community is manipulation. 

This entire posting is a gullible Reddit fandom of Trump. Consumers of "The Apprentice" Reality TV who can't grasp this is part of the POTUS Tony Clifton character and Surkov student screenplays! WHITE_HOUSE_REALITY_WARFARE_FICTION_AVOIDING_NONFICTION_ON_WARFARE - this is organized information warfare since March of year 2013, and Reddit users in February 2026 still eat it up without being able to **cite serious nonfiction** on the subject! It is not enough to just call out one tree, bark at one tree, and not recognize (self-awareness) Reddit is living in a forest! The inability to cite common **on the same page** nonfiction books on paper is the crisis! This is Putin-Trump power! 

1. From September 9, 2014 which is 11 years 5 months and some 2 weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's capure of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. **It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations** that then translate into political action."

7-day Reddit account. TOP upvoted most popular comment. Posting title is generic clickbait. CLICKBAIT_TITLE REDDIT_TOP_COMMENT_YOUNG_ACCOUNT Asking simple "engaging" social media technique questions. PROMOTING_IGNORANCE_WORKS_PLAYING_DUMB_MOCKING There are FAR MORE IMPORTANT NONFICTION topics to be promoting on social media, such as: Jen Senko nonfiction, Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction, Neil Postman nonfiction! PUT AN END TO TRUMPISM, **please stop** LIVING in the toxic ocean of Trump junk mindsets!

ANSWER: The addiction to commenting about politicians on media systems, celebrity fandom, is what is driving society now. What exactly do people believe Donald Trump's talent and gift to be? I see a Reality TV star, a media influencer, and a nation of media cults. Do people think he is a good business man? I think he has a charming personality that charms the pants off men, charms women into supporting nasty aggressive men (like Epstein, Elon Musk), charms money out of people, charms power out of people. A media personality, an actor who is acting a Tony Clifton performance with Surkov students boosted screenplays... TRUMP_CHARMING_ACTOR_ACTING 

"Why do so many people make their entire personality about someone who does not know they exist?" ANSWER: This is an age old problem, we can name it, The Bible verse "1 John 4:20" problem. It is a CRISIS that Bible verse "1 John 4:20" spelled out 2,000 years ago! One of the most printed books in all human history. but people have such a BIBLE_LITERACY problem they can't grasp this very fundamental behavior topic. "people make their entire personality about someone who does not know they exist" - ***have you seen Jesus? Have you seen God?*** - Bible verse "1 John 4:20" https://BibleHub.com/1_john/4-20.htm 

Why oh why on why can't we all turn to "1 John 4:20" SAME_PAGE_SAME_TIME_SAME_UNDERSTANDING and grasp HOW LONG this crisis has been GOING ON! OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhw472vpjtg 83 views February 19, 2026 Lyrics: "Well, **if friends with their fancy persuasion don't admit** that it's part of **a scheme**! But I can't help but have my suspicions... 'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem" - Bible verse "1 John 4:20" repurposed song meaning... HAVE YOU SEEN GOD?

Oh yha, and Jeffery Epstein leadership of "women" is on full display. Little girls being indoctrinated into systemic abuse.

"It’s a humanity issue" - Reddit media comment 2026-02-25 morning USA. Yha, WHAT SPECIFIC HUMANITY ISSUE? Is the issue ignorance? Tiny-short Twitter-thinking Tweet-length 140 character mind patterns? What Carl Sagan described as **1.5 second sound bites** media messaging (like this MOST POPULAR low-information upvoters https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_information_voter Reddit media comment) in year 1995 before Twitter was launched July 15, 2006?

* “and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, year 1995, page 59

AOC repeating programmed MAGA talking points. Reddit community attracted to the dehumanization.

People treating social media like it is anti-reality, a video screen game. ANTI_REALITY And my experience is that competition of defeating and eliminating (killing others) is a huge part of the popular video games. 

* October 16, 2018 https://www.NYtimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/npc-twitter-ban.html - it made New York Times about "non-human players" attitude. This is BEFORE ChatGPT came in year 2022. Already aggressive dehumanization of "competition" was attitude being used in information warfare, cult programming. In other words: the richest businessmen in the entire world programming the rural (MAGA) less-educated people (MAGA) to hate upon *poor people* that are not entertaining. Poor rural people being programmed to hate upon the poor and to prize the beautiful / wealthy / those with cool hardware assets (Musk, etc).
