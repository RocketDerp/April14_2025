That's because people in USA are unwilling to study **nonfiction** of Russia, how wild and bad it is. USA was founded on a thinking system by Free Masons, but that's been abandoned. Pluribus gets mocked for any serious discourse of Free Mason ideals and art work meaning.

Celebrates Trump hate as a signal to follow. Reddit audience celebrates ignorance. No-identity bullshit commenting that avoids nonfiction and mocks serious and sincere people as "weak" like Trump does. *Outplurbed* mocking https://github.com/GreatSealUSA/GreatSealUSA_Art/blob/main/PLUR1BUS/OutPlurbed/Mockery_Of_A_Nation_OutPlurbed.md . Trump is a leader of media addiction on intimate touch devices. The introduction of the Apple iPhone in June 2007 has more to do with Trump Reality TV stardom coming over to Reddit than anything. 

This Reddit comment, the one linked, is celebrating Rupert Murdoch as the "deeply seated issue". Bamboozled Rural less-education population. Reddit users with the ability to write paragraphs like this will not engage Neil Postman's library of books. High Speed HDTV and Reddit messages are a risk to humanity and Neil Postman called it out in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", that is the deep-seated issue. October 7, 1996 Fox News, and then Reddit and Twitter came along, Facebook, etc. Elon Musk purchasing Twitter wasn't an accident and Reddit mocked away. Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Truth Social, Russia Today, Internet Research Agency. This Reddit comment **wants to sell $180/hour one on one mind doctors and [does not want to face the Cambridge Analytica doctors](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md)** since year 2013 / Dr. Abraham Brill doctor issues! Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan explains Reddit and Truth Social addict behaviors.

The USA **entire population is mentally unwell**. Trump content makes people mentally sick. This is a sick society, sicko nation. Media addiction to Russian information warfare since March 2013. Hate vs. hate, mock vs mock, hate for hate, mocking against mocking. Feedback loops of social media, "The Media" is the mass-age. Abandoned understanding of Marshall McLuhan.

Observe: absence of book quotes, book titles, author names, links to off-Reddit sources. Just promoting the addiction to Reddit commenting instead of getting on *the same page* of printed books and articles. Anti-Wiki anti-FAQ, anything to just feed commenting over and over and over about Donald Trump's behavior (the title of the Reddit posting).

Level the standing government and population, blow all their minds with Entertainment that Reddit spreads all over the Internet... then step in and bey not-Trump and blame Trump. People will be so drunk on memes when Trump is gone, so much celebration of ignorance in USA... Anything to avoid facing the media addiction issues and the failure to grasp media ecology (and Russian information warfare on Twitter and Reddit study since March 2013).

Message to lead the audience that jokes are what matters most. Couch couch couch chanting on serious governing issues and analysis. Anything to make the USA programmed to be ignorant and banal. I created this Reddit learning community May 1, 2019 before pandemic on this "just a joke, bro" humor-washing of MAGA. https://old.reddit.com/r/HyperBanalisation

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1q6k1tu/trump_suggests_insane_new_motive_for_invading/ny85njv/

A "rock", a stone on the ground, does not provide the entertainment content. Trump feeds EVERY PERSON, all sides, not just TWO / BOTH sides, but every person's touch-device media addiction stimulation dreams. People ignore Marshall McLuhan from University of Toronto.

Nobody on Reddit has the balls to confront low-effort Twitter-length comment message addictions. The addicts to saying Donald Trump { toddler, dumb, idiot, baby, stupid, moron } over and over in a loop every day on Reddit commenting sections. This is the very mechanism of power for Trump. ]Audiences who eat the Surkovian Onions](../Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) and think the onion taste great! [Shit-eating LOL LOL amusement audience on Reddit, people grading the turds of Trump as they pour down / trickle down from the wealthy media empires](/Grim_Blunt/Society_of_grading_and_ranking_turds.md).

Reddit meme addicts do not realize Trump is an actor. Trump has been an actor decades before he went into the White House in early year 2017. Trump is acting. President Tony Clifton, live every day all day. Acting to Surkov screenplays, SNL NYC home town of Trump, Tony Clifton improvisation and scripting hybrid Russian warfare. ACTOR that Reddit community of meme addicts eat up, fall for.

Reddit audience comment contribution has now become the very source of Trump / MAGA / Fox News normal making, normalization... prizing shit as thrilling content. Billionaires hoover it up into LLM training to continue the billionaire trickle-down feedback loops for shit-loving toxic ocean meme addicts.
