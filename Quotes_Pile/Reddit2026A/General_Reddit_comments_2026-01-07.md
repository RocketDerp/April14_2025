That's because people in USA are unwilling to study **nonfiction** of Russia, how wild and bad it is. USA was founded on a thinking system by Free Masons, but that's been abandoned. Pluribus gets mocked for any serious discourse of Free Mason ideals and art work meaning.

Celebrates Trump hate as a signal to follow. Reddit audience celebrates ignorance. No-identity bullshit commenting that avoids nonfiction and mocks serious and sincere people as "weak" like Trump does. *Outplurbed* mocking https://github.com/GreatSealUSA/GreatSealUSA_Art/blob/main/PLUR1BUS/OutPlurbed/Mockery_Of_A_Nation_OutPlurbed.md . Trump is a leader of media addiction on intimate touch devices. The introduction of the Apple iPhone in June 2007 has more to do with Trump Reality TV stardom coming over to Reddit than anything. 

This Reddit comment, the one linked, is celebrating Rupert Murdoch as the "deeply seated issue". Bamboozled Rural less-education population. Reddit users with the ability to write paragraphs like this will not engage Neil Postman's library of books. High Speed HDTV and Reddit messages are a risk to humanity and Neil Postman called it out in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", that is the deep-seated issue. October 7, 1996 Fox News, and then Reddit and Twitter came along, Facebook, etc. Elon Musk purchasing Twitter wasn't an accident and Reddit mocked away. Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Truth Social, Russia Today, Internet Research Agency. This Reddit comment **wants to sell $180/hour one on one mind doctors and [does not want to face the Cambridge Analytica doctors](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md)** since year 2013 / Dr. Abraham Brill doctor issues!

The USA **entire population is mentally unwell**. Trump content makes people mentally sick. This is a sick society, sicko nation. Media addiction to Russian information warfare since March 2013. Hate vs. hate, mock vs mock, hate for hate, mocking against mocking. Feedback loops of social media, "The Media" is the mass-age. Abandoned understanding of Marshall McLuhan.

Nobody on Reddit has the balls to confront low-effort Twitter-length comment message addictions. The addicts to saying Donald Trump { toddler, dumb, idiot, baby, stupid, moron } over and over in a loop every day on Reddit commenting sections. This is the very mechanism of power for Trump. [Audiences who eat the Surkovian Onions](../Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) and think the onion taste great! [Shit-eating LOL LOL amusement audience on Reddit, people grading the turds of Trump as they pour down / trickle down from the wealthy media empires](/Grim_Blunt/Society_of_grading_and_ranking_turds.md).

Reddit meme addicts do not realize Trump is an actor. Trump has been an actor decades before he went into the White House in early year 2017. Trump is acting. President Tony Clifton, live every day all day. Acting to Surkov screenplays, SNL NYC home town of Trump, Tony Clifton improvisation and scripting hybrid Russian warfare. ACTOR that Reddit community of meme addicts eat up, fall for.

Reddit audience comment contribution has now become the very source of Trump / MAGA / Fox News normal making, normalization... prizing shit as thrilling content.

Right vs. left brainrot. Out-group brainrot mindsets. Human beings behave like this all over the world and throughout history. Out-group domination. Long before "left vs. right" was framing it. If other nations had the wealth, power, military, technology of the USA - Reddit users wouldn't grasp it is driven by masculine domination / power drives that we are not facing. If Russia had twice the power and 10 times the wealth, war with Ukraine and others would be worse. Reddit community mindset (mob mentality of left vs. right USA only) is to avoid American from Atlanta 1954 learning. Stuck in 1931 logic polarity mindsets, Us vs. Them / Left vs. Right. team-sport, gaming, gamer, screen gamer logic of "enemy" humans. That others people are aliens to war against gaming strategy mindsets. MAGA mindsets, Putinism. Surkov won since March 2013.

Addiction to the exciting thrilling sports entertainment, online high-speed punishment and reward via money and living rent-paid in minds. Billionaires control the audience, puppet people to worship the Elon Musk / Murdoch / Trump / Putin leaders (all multi-billionaires).

I personally worked for the richest people in the entire world in Bellevue Washington, year 1996. NBA team owner, I was part of the owner's representatives in purchasing / takeover of NFL Seattle Seahawks. Having access to the owner's inside research and planning was very eye opening how "The Little Guy" in the audience is delivered big content. Apps empire, Dreamworks film empire, music producer empire / Jimi Hendrix museum, NFL, NBA, brain study institution,  fleet or private jets and private cruise ships, private homes all over the world. Wired World. People are deeply programmed from childhood to prize the branding and owners of their players.

Audiences eat the "Trickle Down Content" from billionares. People think economic money is "Trickle Down", but it is images of Trump and images of sports assets that trickle down. All highly manipulated by public relationships industry.

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

Imagine how many lives the bullying of autistic people on Reddit and gaming systems has ruined. I get "you a bot", "you ChatGPT", "you LLM" all over Reddit in year 2025. Language bigots who can't pass a turning test of real human diversity / neurodiversity. People who react as the billionaires who create LLM systems program people to react. To turn against human persons with Reddit machine lust. The power to use Reddit to humanize diverse people.

The "something" to do never seems to address that a Television star, an addict to television and Twitter, uses media systems. Trump did not take over this nation with guns, brainrot is the problem. People bitch and bitch about Facebook behavior and Fox News behavior, but will not be serious about nonfiction learning about media systems. Professor Marshall McLuhan, Professor Neil Postman not being taught on Reddit and Bluesky. People do not stand up for education, they do not organize with intellectual teaching of adults.

Almost every time I step into social media, assholes repeat the same things; you write funny, you have language problems, you are a person from outside the USA, you are an immigrant, you are a robot, you are a non-person machine. Bullying of autism. People think they are the only one to ever notice you are unusual / atypical / different / neurodivergent. It was not like that before year 2013. When hate and mocking and bullying became core values of USA society. When bullies and snark run the entire nation now, people do it even more.

People will not face up to their addiction to unimportant and non-essential entertainment. Humans can live without television and video games and discuss nonfiction serious matters.

Black Lives Matter... not very much. Brown lives matter... not very much. But a pretty white woman in a nice suburb area with a nice car... now that's got Reddit alarmed!

Standing up against ALL HATE in ALL PLACES is not a concern. Russia has mind-fucked the population into such predictable patterns of media addiction. The entire point of "Black Lives Matter" is this behavior. The entire planet, all of Earth, is being terrorized by meme addicts / one nation that will not confront horrific smartphone and television **cults and addictions**. Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman books and videos are the intelligent educated way to deal with Trump / MAGA / Fox News HDTV / Newsmax / Elon Musk Twitter / Russia Today / Kremlin / White House values problems.

The Media. Reddit "The Media" social has been online for over two full decades. Denial of current year 2026 reality abounds on Reddit. As if they are in an echo-chamber / filter-bubble that a Reddit sustained protest would not be covered globally. World Wide Web, WWW, denial itself.

They get in your face, call you a "bot", dehumanize you, call you "mentally unwell" - when you say that Fox News HDTV is the very *billionaire cause* of your mental unwellness as a everyday USA citizen. Communicate that **Musk Twitter and Truth Social have sickened every mind around you** in January 2026 - the street gangs of Reddit organized bullying come after you to get your comments removed.

Look at how technology thirsty the meme addicts of United States of America have become over new technology to come out of billionaires. Sports gamers, video gamers, gaming, anything to avoid nonfiction serious learning from Marshal McLuhan about media addiction / screen addiction mob mentality.

A nation of 0.34 billion conquest of the planet of 8 billion people for tech love!

The burnout of audience minds is very real. Neil Postman was very correct in 1985 book, 1992 book. Such mob mentality burnout of USA society at hands of sports-owners, "Entertainment" Fox News HDTV since year 1996, Reddit hive mind, Musk Twitter hive mind, Facebook Mark Z hivemind, Putin Internet Research Agency mental insurgency since March 2013.

Sports technology, sports medical technology, sports media relations technology to audiences.

* “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology." ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, **year 1992**

How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

* “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. No recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet.

Reddit audience member incredibly entertained, finds it amusing and funny, when Americans don't understand basic morality lessons. Mocking away at the ignorant people instead of realizing media empires and comics have taught generations to favor action violence. People who prize others being ignorant and celebrating ignorance so they can chuckle how funny the situation is.

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

* “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. No recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit...

Entire denial of Elon Musk, Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump's huge operations. Every person in their own filter-bubble, like some who think it is "Epstein" behind all the motivations. The wild self-harm anti-learning anti-goodness movement seems tied to Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency, and **the part USA people won't hear** is that MULTIPLE NATIONS have provided analysis of Cambridge Analytica and IRA activities to manipulate minds into self-harm.

The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by tech**nological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Putin won an information war against social media systems, Reddit inclusive, but people are in massively deep psychological denial. Anonymous no-identity Reddit commenting mind-fucked the audience into predictable reaction patterns. Year 2014:

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

* “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. No recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit...

Yes. Anti-goodness for All. 

::: When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways. :::

The terrible idea is the widespread faith in mocking. Mocking is not resisting Trump. Trump makes a mockery of all goodness! Trump turns everything into a joke or a meme or a mockable situation. By mocking, people are adopting the very system of Trump's power. Anti-intellectual, anti-teaching, anti-goodness. 

Mocking "Fox News dumb", and "Church is dumb" does not educate people on WHY. Gullibility is driven by billionaires mocking poor people, rural less educated people. Mocking does not educate, it does not teach. People who follow Trump consider mocking normalcy, they are attracted to the very signals of hate and mocking leadership. People can no longer imagine a society where people are sincere, honest, and not tricking them!

An educated intelligent population should be encouraged, begged for, pleaded for. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_sincerity#In_philosophy

Billionaires are the teachers. Fox News HDTV, Elon Musk richest person in the world Twitter. All the successful athletes and stars are on these media systems and paraded. Mocking everyday people as worthless and unimportant is what billionaires do! The ecosystem of adult values is driven by dissing, humiliating, defeating, having more than others. Being more hate-filled and hate-prizing as a form of competition has become normal since year 2013.

This is fundamentally what people do not grasp that Surkov students have weaponized! It is the absolute faith people have in mocking. Russia has seen it under Putin for over 25 years.

It i a toxic faith, and it is the very mechanism the Internet Research Agency exploited!

There has been almost nobody taking the high road. The high road is standing up for goodness. Quoting Martin Luther King Jr to MAGA. Persisting in blaming Russia to give people the actual source of Trump's power. Not just saying one-word "Russia" and "Putin", but educating people on Surkov techniques and weaponized humor and mockery itself (Neil Postman's teachings). 

This should be household name level information: September 9, 2014 - Johns Hopkins University information expert is author of this article: By Peter Pomerantsev

* "At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations" - https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

Tech addicts can't even see that We The People do not take the high road! Reddit users have not taken the EDUCATION and TEACHING and **made Jen Senko a household name** regarding billionaire media networks, Fox News! The high road is not your PERSONAL channel choice of avoiding Fox News, it is dusting off Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and teaching it, over and over, that this is the self-awareness against billionaires you stand for!

We make sports stars and attractive actors household names. We need to make teachers of why Fox News is toxic to society household names and admired for bravery to stand up against massively powerful media empires!

Entertainment and amusement is why Trump is the constant center of all USA attention since June 16, 2015. Putin won by exploiting the deep seated faith that if it "feels good" to be part of mob mentality and entertaining - it must *be good*.

* “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

* “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. No recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit...

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1q99ws5/ice_barbies_latest_stunt_sent_trump_insiders_into/nytjq7z/

That's been the whole basis of the Kremlin information warfare. To put people in so much fiction that they no longer are concerned with or attracted to nonfiction. The addiction to fiction storytelling overcomes any desire for goodness itself.

Avoiding reality  is exactly what people have been doing. Being serious about unimportant sports games / gamers / video games and not being serious about nonfiction learning and rescuing MAGA from Russian information warfare. Things have gotten worse day after day since Jun 16, 2015. There is no end in sight to the addiction people have to denial of the Internet Research Agency mental mnipulation!

Anything to avoid the Fox News HDTV addictions that have played a huge role in wrecking the USA. Just ignore it and don't bother repeating the names of { Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee }. Just keep repeating Sponge Bob images and commenting.
