That's because people in USA are unwilling to study **nonfiction** of Russia, how wild and bad it is. USA was founded on a thinking system by Free Masons, but that's been abandoned. Pluribus gets mocked for any serious discourse of Free Mason ideals and art work meaning.

Celebrates Trump hate as a signal to follow. Reddit audience celebrates ignorance. No-identity bullshit commenting that avoids nonfiction and mocks serious and sincere people as "weak" like Trump does. *Outplurbed* mocking https://github.com/GreatSealUSA/GreatSealUSA_Art/blob/main/PLUR1BUS/OutPlurbed/Mockery_Of_A_Nation_OutPlurbed.md . Trump is a leader of media addiction on intimate touch devices. The introduction of the Apple iPhone in June 2007 has more to do with Trump Reality TV stardom coming over to Reddit than anything. 

This Reddit comment, the one linked, is celebrating Rupert Murdoch as the "deeply seated issue". Bamboozled Rural less-education population. Reddit users with the ability to write paragraphs like this will not engage Neil Postman's library of books. High Speed HDTV and Reddit messages are a risk to humanity and Neil Postman called it out in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", that is the deep-seated issue. October 7, 1996 Fox News, and then Reddit and Twitter came along, Facebook, etc. Elon Musk purchasing Twitter wasn't an accident and Reddit mocked away. Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Truth Social, Russia Today, Internet Research Agency. This Reddit comment **wants to sell $180/hour one on one mind doctors and [does not want to face the Cambridge Analytica doctors](../Cambridge_Analytica_Quotes.md)** since year 2013 / Dr. Abraham Brill doctor issues!

The USA **entire population is mentally unwell**. Trump content makes people mentally sick. This is a sick society, sicko nation. Media addiction to Russian information warfare since March 2013. Hate vs. hate, mock vs mock, hate for hate, mocking against mocking. Feedback loops of social media, "The Media" is the mass-age. Abandoned understanding of Marshall McLuhan.

Observe: absence of book quotes, book titles, author names, links to off-Reddit sources. Just promoting the addiction to Reddit commenting instead of getting on *the same page* of printed books and articles. Anti-Wiki anti-FAQ, anything to just feed commenting over and over and over about Donald Trump's behavior (the title of the Reddit posting).

Level the standing government and population, blow all their minds with Entertainment that Reddit spreads all over the Internet... then step in and bey not-Trump and blame Trump. People will be so drunk on memes when Trump is gone, so much celebration of ignorance in USA... Anything to avoid facing the media addiction issues and the failure to grasp media ecology (and Russian information warfare on Twitter and Reddit study since March 2013).

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1q6k2p1/has_anyone_checked_on_j_d_vance_and_tulsi_gabbard/ny83p68/

Message to lead the audience that jokes are what matters most. Couch couch couch chanting on serious governing issues and analysis. Anything to make the USA programmed to be ignorant and banal.

https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1q6k1tu/trump_suggests_insane_new_motive_for_invading/ny83plz/

Nobody on Reddit has the balls to confront low-effort Twitter-length comment message addictions. The addicts to saying Donald Trump { toddler, dumb, idiot, baby, stupid, moron } over and over in a loop every day on Reddit commenting sections. This is the very mechanism of power for Trump. [Audiences who eat the Surkovian Onions](../Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) and think the onion taste great! [Shit-eating LOL LOL amusement audience on Reddit, people grading the turds of Trump as they pour down / trickle down from the wealthy media empires](/Grim_Blunt/Society_of_grading_and_ranking_turds.md).

Reddit meme addicts do not realize Trump is an actor. Trump has been an actor decades before he went into the White House in early year 2017. Trump is acting. President Tony Clifton, live every day all day. Acting to Surkov screenplays, SNL NYC home town of Trump, Tony Clifton improvisation and scripting hybrid Russian warfare. ACTOR that Reddit community of meme addicts eat up, fall for.

Reddit audience comment contribution has now become the very source of Trump / MAGA / Fox News normal making, normalization... prizing shit as thrilling content. Billionaires hoover it up into LLM training to continue the billionaire trickle-down feedback loops for shit-loving toxic ocean meme addicts.

https://old.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1q6ff9j/trump_is_hitler_and_america_is_turning_into_1930s/ny7l30r/

Garbage into mind, garbage out.](../Reddit2025A/Misc0/2025-08-04_media_makes_the_society.md) Rupert Murdoch since October 7, 1996 has not hired stupid employees and outside firms to create his content. Billionaires are not stupid, Elon Musk is not stupid. The Twitter audience prizes stupid messages and memes. Never underestimate meme burnout, billionaire trick down content causing audience burnout / brainrot.

https://old.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1q6k2hh/ice_just_shot_a_woman_in_minneapolis_in_the_face/ny89oy2/

Reddit audience is so stimulated and trilled to have constant "BREAKING NEWS" on top of Reddit /r/All about thrills and violence. The addiction to Trump content. Hate prizing, dehumanization, all to feed low-effort commenting addiction and intimate-touch screen devices / iPhone / iPad / Android ARG mindsets of Reddit consumers. Mob mindsets, mentality. Look at the Reddit username, "Timely Influencer" / Influence. Sexual attraction to Epstein and I.C.E. stimulation images / stories.

ANYTHING to avoid **nonfiction learning** about Russian information warfare methods / [cult creation by Kremlin to media content. Media cults](/June8_2025/Religions_Political_Parties_Cults_MassMind_MassMan.md). Reddit cults, Elon Musk Twitter cults, Fox News HDTV cults, etc.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1q6ld2a/so_the_right_suddenly_wants_30_million_more/ny8enow/

Right vs. left brainrot. Out-group brainrot mindsets. Human beings behave like this all over the world and throughout history. Out-group domination. Long before "left vs. right" was framing it. If other nations had the wealth, power, military, technology of the USA - Reddit users wouldn't grasp it is driven by masculine domination / power drives that we are not facing. If Russia had twice the power and 10 times the wealth, war with Ukraine and others would be worse. Reddit community mindset (mob mentality of left vs. right USA only) is to avoid American from Atlanta 1954 learning. Stuck in 1931 logic polarity mindsets, Us vs. Them / Left vs. Right. team-sport, gaming, gamer, screen gamer logic of "enemy" humans. That others people are aliens to war against gaming strategy mindsets. MAGA mindsets, Putinism. Surkov won since March 2013.

That is what is important on Reddit. Twitter messages screenshots on Reddit to mock and mockery away at. Constant simulation by Elon Musk media platform on Reddit. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid using spare time and free time to learn nonfiction cult behavior issues to Reddit media and Tweet media.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/1q6ld2a/so_the_right_suddenly_wants_30_million_more/ny8fn4r/

Simple-short messages. Prizing of Twitter content. Simulation against Twitter screenshots. Anything to not quote nonfiction books. No author name, no links, no thought-out analysis quoted. Just perpetual rounds of mocking back and forth with junk images of South America and other image trash. Fiction storytelling with low-effort commenting. Media addiction now runs USA society, flocking to MAGA mindsets on Reddit.

Anything and everything to avoid how things changed with the lead-up to the February 20, 2014 Ukraine war. Changed with the invasion of Reddit since March 2013 by the Internet Research Agency. No-identity cowards of media, Reddit users who block / ban anyone who dissents to the Reddit toxic hive mind that Russia manipulates and owns for Putin.

Just like Reddit users are block-happy aggressive addicts to dehumanization people with machine systems. Just like Bluesky. Masked, no-identity moderators and users who report and have others banned and blocked out of egomania / egoism values (Trump leads Truth Social society of egomania). Tech industry society, technopoly worshipers / cults of tech. What changed since year 2013 is the Internet Research Agency invading Reddit. https://www.BBC.com/news/technology-43301643 And everyday people abandoning nonfiction learning about Kremlin media techniques and Putin values.

Russia is not the concern as the enemy (who owns MAGA, owns Trump, owns White House mentally) on Reddit. Always Americans in rural farm areas who are poorly educated. Never is Neil Postman's nonfiction books the cure to Fox News billionaires manipulating rural people with memes and HDTV content. And Putin's manipulation of rural less-educated people. On Reddit hive mind programming platform, the enemy is "The Little Guy" fucked over by Truth Social and Elon Musk Twitter. Reddit hive minded audience won't face up to the denial: https://www.BBC.com/news/technology-43301643 - Surkov won since March 2013. Reddit users can't see when it all turned sour, went to hell.

People who are so incredibly gullible that they think Trump is not an actor doing scenes of ballrooms and locations for photographs. Reddit lives for images / photographs of Trump.

Tech addiction / media addiction is the deepest drive that Surkov students have targeted in human minds since March 2013.

Addiction to the exciting thrilling sports entertainment, online high-speed punishment and reward via money and living rent-paid in minds. Billionaires control the audience, puppet people to worship the Elon Musk / Murdoch / Trump / Putin leaders (all multi-billionaires).

I personally worked for the richest people in the entire world in Bellevue Washington, year 1996. NBA team owner, I was part of the owner's representatives in purchasing / takeover of NFL Seattle Seahawks. Having access to the owner's inside research and planning was very eye opening how "The Little Guy" in the audience is delivered big content. Apps empire, Dreamworks film empire, music producer empire / Jimi Hendrix museum, NFL, NBA, brain study institution,  fleet or private jets and private cruise ships, private homes all over the world. Wired World. People are deeply programmed from childhood to prize the branding and owners of their players.

Audiences eat the "Trickle Down Content" from billionares. People think economic money is "Trickle Down", but it is images of Trump and images of sports assets that trickle down. All highly manipulated by public relationships industry.
