Nothing about the predictable commenting abut Trump after a decade is surprising. Top upvoted, 1 year Reddit account. Zero self-awareness of not resisting education and teaching. Just lazy commenting that will not break the "game loop" of Reddit minds in the Russian screen game

* "what Putin will do next — that he’s unpredictable and thus dangerous. We’re rendered stunned, spun, and flummoxed by the Kremlin’s weaponization of absurdity and unreality.” - year 2014. September 9, 2014 https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

What is most important about that quote is the date. September 9 is before November election date. By years. Yet, the population has abandoned nonfiction learning in favor of Trump artwork and antics.
