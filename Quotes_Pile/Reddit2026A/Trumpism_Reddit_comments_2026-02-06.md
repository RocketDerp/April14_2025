Nothing about the predictable commenting about Trump (downplaying the reality) after a decade is surprising. Top upvoted, 1 year Reddit account. Zero self-awareness of not resisting education and teaching. Just lazy commenting that will not break the "game loop" of Reddit minds in the Russian screen game

* "what Putin will do next — that he’s unpredictable and thus dangerous. We’re rendered stunned, spun, and flummoxed by the Kremlin’s weaponization of absurdity and unreality.” - year 2014. September 9, 2014 https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

What is most important about that quote is the date. September 9 is before November election date. By years. Yet, the population has abandoned nonfiction learning in favor of Trump artwork and antics.

Tuesday, September 9, 2014 publication day   
Tuesday, June 16, 2015 Trump campaign start day  
Tuesday, November 8, 2016 election day   

Every day I encounter minds that behave like this Reddit comment. Trump is a source of "locker room talk", Trump's ability to amuse and create laughs for fandoms far exceeds anyone's desire to travel the world, raise children, do anything but chuckle all day an night on their smartphone about how dumb idiot stupid we all are now. Superbowl billionaire celebration is coming up. I helped purchase the Seahawks for Jody Allen. I interviewed the coach and players briefly one on one in their office and on the practice field. The Experience Music Project, Experience Sports Owner Project, Experience ESPN Hosting Project... I had any research and learning tool I could ever need.

Eternal September late 1993 and early 1994 never ended. I had a background in social media with The Fortress in 219 area code an from-scratch Commodore 128 app I had developed and sold commercially. I was a believer in open Usenet like I was a believer in open SMTP e-mail. But, I have to admit, nobody ever noticed, including me. That Microsoft Exchange Server used used SMTP for e-mail but did not use NNTP for Public Folders. The "social media" was proprietary and had no convention to share with outside world. The e-mail did, but not the social media.

I used Fark and Slashdot, but I did not see Reddit and Twitter and Facebook coming. We all knew video like YouTube was coming, but we never imagined that Usenet OPEN social media would fade away. I still remember when the Deja Vu archive was offline. https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/new-economy-google-s-revival-usenet-archive-opens-up-wealth-possibilities-but.html

* "Web-based archiving of Usenet posts began in March 1995 at Deja News with a very large, searchable database." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet

The progress of Internet speed and CPU speed alone and mobile networks was what I focused on instead. Travel and working from home office since Thanksgiving 1999. But I came home from living in South America the day after Katrina hit South Florida "South Florida Landfall: Katrina made its first U.S. landfall on August 25, 2005, at approximately 6:30 p.m. EDT". I still remember, because we had a new RV waiting for housing and we could not get car insurance, they banned sales of car insurance in Florida. So we couldn't move into our pre-arranged housing after flying in to Miami. My mom and dad were retired and living in The Villages, but my wife and I both worked from home and had the TV all planned out. It ended up being just a 1 day delay as we managed to get insurance out of Texas address and take delivery of the new RV off the dealer lot.

Leisure Travel Free Spirit 210B 3S (model year 2006) was our new home office. Canadian camper, European van. Back then, USA did not have tall roof vans yet.

Katrina was yet to hit New Orleans. We had been to NOLA before going to South America. When we had our 1987 Bluebird Wanderlodge PT40. You could sense the social turning point of Texas in 2006 when the city re-opened for Fat Tuesday 2006. https://www.splcenter.org/resources/reports/hurricane-katrina-racial-stigma/

I did not see Twitter and Facebook and Reddit coming as a social force in 1999, or I would have authored social media Y2K instead of a from-scratch e-commerce system Thanksgiving 1999 in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. I didn't make that mistake seeing SXSW March 2008 https://www.fastcompany.com/3026937/the-untold-story-behind-mark-zuckerbergs-sxsw-keynote-debacle/ - when I was involved in the Linux users groups in Austin. 

Sunday in March 2008 was when I realized Austin had a view in the inward journey of mob mentality. That *online social media* behavior and Apple iPhone 1 year 2007 was changing onine social to offline mobs. 

* "**Unknowingly to everyone in the room, this would become a landmark moment** on many fronts from keynotes to interviewing techniques to content. Suddenly everyone was an expert."  - https://briansolis.com/2008/03/sarah-lacy-on-sarah-lacy-and-sxsw-mark/

I had my own corporation. a consulting company and I purchased the the Apple iPhone 1 and I was considering making apps. That was the new future. But social changes of "work at home" co-working movement in Austin was also in my focus.

* "The original iPhone was announced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention in San Francisco. It was released for sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00 p.m. local time, with prices starting at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model." - Google Search summary 2026-02-06 morning USA

Yet, it was that SXSW March 2008 that really opened my eyes. I started to dust off Marshall McLuhan. Half Price Books was my regular visit to pick up Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan books. I was *witnessing* that the RV life I had lived going mainstream.

Repeating: "**Unknowingly to everyone in the room, this would become a landmark moment** on many fronts from keynotes to interviewing techniques to content. Suddenly everyone was an expert." ... and I witnessed small businesses all over Austin adopting social media and I started to ponder what was happening.

Saturday January 3, 2009 https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna49378197

I did not notice that far away. But I had worked for SAP in Germany, and I started thinking about Africa as I was pushing Ubuntu in Austin as "Linux on the desktop" for the mainstream.  Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope), released on April 23, 2009 for SXSW 2009. Had some fun parties, but Linux on the smarpthone with Android / Google was the hot thing... not Linux on the desktop in 2009.

But I did come across this article in the summer of 2009: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html

And after witnessing what I had seen in March 2008, Repeating:  "**Unknowingly to everyone in the room, this would become a landmark moment** on many fronts from keynotes to interviewing techniques to content. Suddenly everyone was an expert." - I suspected a new form of "Eternal September 1993" was going to be taking place in part of the world that did not grow up on ASCII variations. Places where the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64 were not in local retail stores.

On December 16, 2009 I predicted the Arab Spring and made it my main focus and center of attention. I started meeting women in Tunisia on Facebook. Very open, curious, educated, intelligent women. Who did not want the lifestyle of their mother's generation. University educated women in Tunisia and Algeria.

* "By Michael Slackman May 26, 2007. ALGIERS, May 25 — In this tradition-bound nation scarred by a brutal Islamist-led civil war that killed more than 100,000, a quiet revolution is under way: **women are emerging as an economic and political force unheard of in the rest of the Arab world.**" https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html

Right there from a home office in Austin, I saw the waves of Twitter and Facebook and Reddit hitting north Africa. The Great Seal USA pyramid was now the center of attention to women in north Africa. Women were using USA Twitter, USA Facebook, USA YouTube. And a few of them said they had learned their English from rock music on the radio. Michael Jackson at age 14 and 16... and now these women were age 24 and 29.

Women who were interested in rock music lyric meanings over the Internet using USA social media. Free thinking women. Oh, I hadn't forgotten September 11, 2001. I had studied the Quran a little after 9/11. But rock music AND the Quran, who was ready to push back against Mecca and Saudi Arabia?

I had seen Michael Jackson in the mecca of music, Detroit, **Motown**. I had the ability to find tracks on YouTube that newcomers to the computers and Internet were amazed by. The ladies in north Africa never knew that Michael Jackson had worked for Pepsi. My father worked for Pepsi, RKO pictures / RKO music as am executive.

That link was shared over the Internet to north Africa during February 2010 by me. Eyes opened by educated women seeking their masters degrees in English. You are a whole new generation, ladies. EDUCATED women in Islam. The ground beneath you is changing, Unicode commenting on social media is mainstream. Eternal September 2009 had started in north Africa.

OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJifw6Kej2s 4,719,102 views January 14, 2013 - I've seen that Eternal September road before... inward journey. Marshall McLuhan and James Joyce year 2008 and year 2009 rising up from BBS days in 1985 and Eternal September 1993. Still they lead me back to Marshall McLuhan and 1923 Finn's Hotel in Dublin.

* "Women make up 70 percent of Algeria’s lawyers and 60 percent of its judges. Women dominate medicine. Increasingly, women contribute more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, university researchers say." -  May 25, 2007 the outcomes of Terrorism and men fucking up society.

* الجماعة الإسلامية المسلّحة "Between 1992 and 1998, the GIA conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation (notably in Bentalha and Rais). It attacked and killed other Islamists who had left the GIA or attempted to negotiate with the government. It also targeted foreign civilians living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriate men and women."

Reddit mindset. "Vote harder" as all the avoidance of nonfiction, avoidance of Jen Senko leadership, avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee is "upvote" every minute of every hour of every day and night, over and over on Reddit. Reddit needs to face Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman... and Dr. Bandy X Lee's public education.

You can't have 5% of your population be terrorists. You can't have 10%, 30%. You gotta keep it to well below 1%. Surkov won, Putin won, NATO lost. Pentagon did not grasp 1968 book "War and Peace in the Global Village". I'm not hopeless, but things are very grim on Reddit in people not addressing the Fox News cult and Reddit cultists.

Reddit February 2026 midnset is TECHNICAL, that by bmocking out MAGA with technology tools, block button, just as MAGA wants to do with foreingers and immigrants and libereals... block-button the telephone ICE button...

QUOTE OF NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:

BILL MOYERS: Can Westerners **grasp** the mystical experience that leaves theology behind? If you’re locked to the image of God in a culture where science determines your **perceptions of reality**, how can you experience this ultimate ground that the shamans talk about?

CAMPBELL: Well, people do experience it. Those in the Middle Ages who experienced it were usually burned as heretics. One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, “I and the Father are one.” He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, [a great Sufi mystic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hallaj) said, “I and my beloved are one,” and he, too, was crucified. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, “O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works.” Another of the **Sufi mystics** said, “The function of the orthodox community is to give the mystic his desire, which is a union with God, through mortification and death.”

MOYERS: What has undercut this experience today?

CAMPBELL: It’s characteristic of democracy that **majority rule is understood** as being effective not only in politics but also in thinking. **In thinking, of course, the majority is always wrong**.

MOYERS: Always wrong?

CAMPBELL: In matters of this kind, yes. The majority’s function in relation to the spirit is to try to listen and to open up to someone who’s had an experience beyond that of food, shelter, progeny, and wealth.
Have you ever read **Sinclair Lewis’ Babbitt**?

MOYERS: Not in a long time.

Let me keep repeating repeater: "It’s characteristic of democracy that **majority rule is understood** as being effective not only in politics but also in thinking. **In thinking, of course, the majority is always wrong**." - Summer of 1986, Skywalker Ranch.

UPVOTING, "Likes", are exactly what Campbell is talking about in summer of 1986. Every minute of every single hour of every single day of the nation! Not just voting booths! Not just ballot voting, but UPVOTING and DOWNVOTING on Reddit! Compulsive, reactionary, logic out-group thinking. Bad shit.

SEE_ALSO I have made this comment on Reddit several times, one such instance: https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3e73k4/s2e5_true_detective_s2e5_watchthrough_analysis_by/ctcqgg7/ 2015-07-22T23:29:50Z  - which is after June 16, 2015 when Trump announced and before I telephoned Samantha at the Pentagon to alert about the closed-minded manipulated information warfare mindsets on Reddit.

Most upvoted popular comment. Reddit fandom discussing their favorite Reality TV fiction programming. The images are fake, not reality of the Obama family. Reddit audience is commenting about the schedule of their content addiction, weekday programming. Mind-fucked into audience. Normalizing active messaging via Reddit toxic popularity.
