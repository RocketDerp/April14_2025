Nothing about the predictable commenting about Trump (downplaying the reality) after a decade is surprising. Top upvoted, 1 year Reddit account. Zero self-awareness of not resisting education and teaching. Just lazy commenting that will not break the "game loop" of Reddit minds in the Russian screen game

* "what Putin will do next — that he’s unpredictable and thus dangerous. We’re rendered stunned, spun, and flummoxed by the Kremlin’s weaponization of absurdity and unreality.” - year 2014. September 9, 2014 https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

What is most important about that quote is the date. September 9 is before November election date. By years. Yet, the population has abandoned nonfiction learning in favor of Trump artwork and antics.

Tuesday, September 9, 2014 publication day   
Tuesday, June 16, 2015 Trump campaign start day  
Tuesday, November 8, 2016 election day   

Every day I encounter minds that behave like this Reddit comment. Trump is a source of "locker room talk", Trump's ability to amuse and create laughs for fandoms far exceeds anyone's desire to travel the world, raise children, do anything but chuckle all day an night on their smartphone about how dumb idiot stupid we all are now. Superbowl billionaire celebration is coming up. I helped purchase the Seahawks for Jody Allen. I interviewed the coach and players briefly one on one in their office and on the practice field. The Experience Music Project, Experience Sports Owner Project, Experience ESPN Hosting Project... I had any research and learning tool I could ever need.

Eternal September late 1993 and early 1994 never ended. I had a background in social media with The Fortress in 219 area code an from-scratch Commodore 128 app I had developed and sold commercially. I was a believer in open Usenet like I was a believer in open SMTP e-mail. But, I have to admit, nobody ever noticed, including me. That Microsoft Exchange Server used used SMTP for e-mail but did not use NNTP for Public Folders. The "social media" was proprietary and had no convention to share with outside world. The e-mail did, but not the social media.

I used Fark and Slashdot, but I did not see Reddit and Twitter and Facebook coming. We all knew video like YouTube was coming, but we never imagined that Usenet OPEN social media would fade away. I still remember when the Deja Vu archive was offline. https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/new-economy-google-s-revival-usenet-archive-opens-up-wealth-possibilities-but.html

* "Web-based archiving of Usenet posts began in March 1995 at Deja News with a very large, searchable database." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet

The progress of Internet speed and CPU speed alone and mobile networks was what I focused on instead. Travel and working from home office since Thanksgiving 1999. But I came home from living in South America the day after Katrina hit South Florida "South Florida Landfall: Katrina made its first U.S. landfall on August 25, 2005, at approximately 6:30 p.m. EDT". I still remember, because we had a new RV waiting for housing and we could not get car insurance, they banned sales of car insurance in Florida. So we couldn't move into our pre-arranged housing after flying in to Miami. My mom and dad were retired and living in The Villages, but my wife and I both worked from home and had the TV all planned out. It ended up being just a 1 day delay as we managed to get insurance out of Texas address and take delivery of the new RV off the dealer lot.

Leisure Travel Free Spirit 210B 3S (model year 2006) was our new home office. Canadian camper, European van. Back then, USA did not have tall roof vans yet.

Katrina was yet to hit New Orleans. We had been to NOLA before going to South America. When we had our 1987 Bluebird Wanderlodge PT40. You could sense the social turning point of Texas in 2006 when the city re-opened for Fat Tuesday 2006. https://www.splcenter.org/resources/reports/hurricane-katrina-racial-stigma/

I did not see Twitter and Facebook and Reddit coming as a social force in 1999, or I would have authored social media Y2K instead of a from-scratch e-commerce system Thanksgiving 1999 in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. I didn't make that mistake seeing SXSW March 2008 https://www.fastcompany.com/3026937/the-untold-story-behind-mark-zuckerbergs-sxsw-keynote-debacle/ - when I was involved in the Linux users groups in Austin. 

Sunday in March 2008 was when I realized Austin had a view in the inward journey of mob mentality. That *online social media* behavior and Apple iPhone 1 year 2007 was changing onine social to offline mobs. 

* "**Unknowingly to everyone in the room, this would become a landmark moment** on many fronts from keynotes to interviewing techniques to content. Suddenly everyone was an expert."  - https://briansolis.com/2008/03/sarah-lacy-on-sarah-lacy-and-sxsw-mark/

I had my own corporation. a consulting company and I purchased the the Apple iPhone 1 and I was considering making apps. That was the new future. But social changes of "work at home" co-working movement in Austin was also in my focus.

* "The original iPhone was announced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention in San Francisco. It was released for sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00 p.m. local time, with prices starting at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model." - Google Search summary 2026-02-06 morning USA

Yet, it was that SXSW March 2008 that really opened my eyes. I started to dust off Marshall McLuhan. Half Price Books was my regular visit to pick up Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan books. I was *witnessing* that the RV life I had lived going mainstream.

Repeating: "**Unknowingly to everyone in the room, this would become a landmark moment** on many fronts from keynotes to interviewing techniques to content. Suddenly everyone was an expert." ... and I witnessed small businesses all over Austin adopting social media and I started to ponder what was happening.

Saturday January 3, 2009 https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna49378197

I did not notice that far away. But I had worked for SAP in Germany, and I started thinking about Africa as I was pushing Ubuntu in Austin as "Linux on the desktop" for the mainstream.  Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope), released on April 23, 2009 for SXSW 2009. Had some fun parties, but Linux on the smarpthone with Android / Google was the hot thing... not Linux on the desktop in 2009.

But I did come across this article in the summer of 2009: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html

And after witnessing what I had seen in March 2008, Repeating:  "**Unknowingly to everyone in the room, this would become a landmark moment** on many fronts from keynotes to interviewing techniques to content. Suddenly everyone was an expert." - I suspected a new form of "Eternal September 1993" was going to be taking place in part of the world that did not grow up on ASCII variations. Places where the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64 were not in local retail stores.

On December 16, 2009 I predicted the Arab Spring and made it my main focus and center of attention. I started meeting women in Tunisia on Facebook. Very open, curious, educated, intelligent women. Who did not want the lifestyle of their mother's generation. University educated women in Tunisia and Algeria.

* "By Michael Slackman May 26, 2007. ALGIERS, May 25 — In this tradition-bound nation scarred by a brutal Islamist-led civil war that killed more than 100,000, a quiet revolution is under way: **women are emerging as an economic and political force unheard of in the rest of the Arab world.**" https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html

Right there from a home office in Austin, I saw the waves of Twitter and Facebook and Reddit hitting north Africa. The Great Seal USA pyramid was now the center of attention to women in north Africa. Women were using USA Twitter, USA Facebook, USA YouTube. And a few of them said they had learned their English from rock music on the radio. Michael Jackson at age 14 and 16... and now these women were age 24 and 29.

Women who were interested in rock music lyric meanings over the Internet using USA social media. Free thinking women. Oh, I hadn't forgotten September 11, 2001. I had studied the Quran a little after 9/11. But rock music AND the Quran, who was ready to push back against Mecca and Saudi Arabia?

I had seen Michael Jackson in the mecca of music, Detroit, **Motown**. I had the ability to find tracks on YouTube that newcomers to the computers and Internet were amazed by. The ladies in north Africa never knew that Michael Jackson had worked for Pepsi. My father worked for Pepsi, RKO pictures / RKO music as am executive.

That link was shared over the Internet to north Africa during February 2010 by me. Eyes opened by educated women seeking their masters degrees in English. You are a whole new generation, ladies. EDUCATED women in Islam. The ground beneath you is changing, Unicode commenting on social media is mainstream. Eternal September 2009 had started in north Africa.

OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJifw6Kej2s 4,719,102 views January 14, 2013 - I've seen that Eternal September road before... inward journey. Marshall McLuhan and James Joyce year 2008 and year 2009 rising up from BBS days in 1985 and Eternal September 1993. Still they lead me back to Marshall McLuhan and 1923 Finn's Hotel in Dublin.

* "Women make up 70 percent of Algeria’s lawyers and 60 percent of its judges. Women dominate medicine. Increasingly, women contribute more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, university researchers say." -  May 25, 2007 the outcomes of Terrorism and men fucking up society.

* الجماعة الإسلامية المسلّحة "Between 1992 and 1998, the GIA conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation (notably in Bentalha and Rais). It attacked and killed other Islamists who had left the GIA or attempted to negotiate with the government. It also targeted foreign civilians living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriate men and women."

Reddit mindset. "Vote harder" as all the avoidance of nonfiction, avoidance of Jen Senko leadership, avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee is "upvote" every minute of every hour of every day and night, over and over on Reddit. Reddit needs to face Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman... and Dr. Bandy X Lee's public education.

You can't have 5% of your population be terrorists. You can't have 10%, 30%. You gotta keep it to well below 1%. Surkov won, Putin won, NATO lost. Pentagon did not grasp 1968 book "War and Peace in the Global Village". I'm not hopeless, but things are very grim on Reddit in people not addressing the Fox News cult and Reddit cultists.

Reddit February 2026 mindset is TECHNICAL, that by blocking out MAGA with technology tools, block button, just as MAGA wants to do with foreigners and immigrants and liberals... block-button the telephone ICE button...

QUOTE OF NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:

BILL MOYERS: Can Westerners **grasp** the mystical experience that leaves theology behind? If you’re locked to the image of God in a culture where science determines your **perceptions of reality**, how can you experience this ultimate ground that the shamans talk about?

CAMPBELL: Well, people do experience it. Those in the Middle Ages who experienced it were usually burned as heretics. One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, “I and the Father are one.” He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, [a great Sufi mystic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hallaj) said, “I and my beloved are one,” and he, too, was crucified. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, “O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works.” Another of the **Sufi mystics** said, “The function of the orthodox community is to give the mystic his desire, which is a union with God, through mortification and death.”

MOYERS: What has undercut this experience today?

CAMPBELL: It’s characteristic of democracy that **majority rule is understood** as being effective not only in politics but also in thinking. **In thinking, of course, the majority is always wrong**.

MOYERS: Always wrong?

CAMPBELL: In matters of this kind, yes. The majority’s function in relation to the spirit is to try to listen and to open up to someone who’s had an experience beyond that of food, shelter, progeny, and wealth.
Have you ever read **Sinclair Lewis’ Babbitt**?

MOYERS: Not in a long time.

These **standard advertised wares** — toothpastes, socks, tires, cameras, instantaneous hot-water heaters — were his symbols and proofs of excellence; at first the signs, then the substitutes, for joy and passion and wisdom. {96} But none of these advertised tokens of financial and social success was more significant than a sleeping-porch with a sun-parlor below."

Looking back and looking much deeper at mythology and religions: The Apple iPhone in year 2007 reaches the rural population by year 2011. The Twitter June 6, 2011 really did a number on Reddit hearts and minds and rural less-educated peoples. Media addicts, meme addictions, run wild on Reddit and you can trace back to the meme-thinking origins of images bandwidth vs. text-base social. Reddit didn't used to host video and images. Old Reddit vs. New Reddit. ***Everything Is Media Ecology***. The Internet Research Agency since March 2013 won hearts and minds. So many IRA copycats now.

* "Culture watchers and worriers — those of the type who read books like this one — will know that the examples above are not aberrations but, in fact, clichés. There is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, **have barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality**. Those who have written vigorously on the matter tell us, for example, that what is happening is the residue of an exhausted capitalism; or, on the contrary, that it is the tasteless fruit of the maturing of capitalism; or that it is the neurotic aftermath of the Age of Freud; or the retribution of our allowing God to perish; or that it all comes from the old stand-bys, greed and ambition. **I have attended carefully to these explanations**, and I do not say there is nothing to learn from them. Marxists, Freudians, Lévi-Straussians, even Creation Scientists are not to be taken lightly. And, in any case, I should be very surprised if the story I have to tell is anywhere near the whole truth." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

It's a way of emphasizing, like adding **BOLD**. But Reddit community loves to get all technical and conforming on how people use English language. Bigots of language usage. If you create your own individual way and style of English usage, that isn't conforming to the time period of trending Twitter-style short commenting and meme-speak... shallow superficial concerns. Which is why minds are so easily blown into meme stupors on Reddit with Trump's unique style and techniques of language. It puts Reddit audience into different parts of their brain, the machine-minded syntax laws. The syntax laws become rulers over outsiders, ICE mindsets, MAGA mindsets. Surkov won since March of year 2013. Year 2013 comes after year 2012, BTW.

It’s a strategy of power based on keeping any opposition there may be constantly confused, a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it’s indefinable.

* "Well, if we had really reached the postmodern in its fullest sense – the way Baudrillard uses it – it would be the computers unplugging us and not the reverse. The postmodern is a blurring of the lines between human beings and machines, a blurring of the line between reality and image. It is a society – actually I can’t even really use that word anymore – it is a world, if you will, a grouping of the world in which **reality is simply that which can be simulated, Xeroxed, copied**. That is one of his first theses, it’s a book called Simulations. It’s a very interesting thesis. Baudrillard argues that this process is… one of the central things is the way in which **we… that’s changed us fundamentally and has helped to bring our relations as humans to a close**. I mean, in a way Baudrillard sees himself as a post-apocalyptic writer. For Baudrillard the apocalypse has already occurred; it wasn’t religious or anything, it was not atomic bombs. At some point in the development of technology, **human beings ceased to be the reason** of things and things took on their own reasons… technological things." - https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/ - Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University

All the "Nazi" word programming into Reddit minds, people can not study Russia Ukraine war topics in detail and fixate on 1930's Germany. Surkov won since March 2013.

QUOTE FROM NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:

Hate Training Observations

On the other side of the religious divide stood the new Fundamentalists of Racial Purity and Christianity, whose leaders skillfully manipulated conformity enforcement mechanisms which impel us to pick on those who are different. Typical among these was a group called **Russian National Unity,** which claimed an army of 70,000, snapped up members at the age of nine, enrolled them in "military patriotic clubs," dressed them in fascist uniforms, **gave them the insignia of the swastika, taught them the Nazi salute,** drilled them in combat maneuvers, honed their marksmanship, and identified the target of their weapons in their anthem:

    we are going down the straight road
    to believe, desire, and dare
    death to the cosmopolitan dogs and Jews and masons!

National Unity's founder, karate coach Alexander Barkashov, quoted yet another tune when giving interviews on the dangers of world Jewry and of the United States:

    Plunge your knife in the vampire's throat  
    And the world will become good again.

Many parents welcomed National Unity's training for mass murder.

She started with Eric Clapton, which has turned into a big hate promoter. 

* "Based on available information, Sheryl Crow has not publicly condemned Eric Clapton regarding his past racist remarks or controversial views on COVID-19 vaccinations. Following their brief romantic relationship in the late 1990s, the two have remained on good terms, with Crow frequently expressing admiration for him, calling him a "good friend," and performing at his Crossroads Guitar Festival as recently as 2023. Despite the public controversy surrounding Clapton, Crow has not used her public platform to denounce him, instead collaborating with him as recently as her 2019 album Threads." - Google Search Summary, 2026-02-06 USA afternoon

* "Eric Clapton's history of controversial public statements is anchored by his infamous August 1976 concert at the Birmingham Odeon, where an inebriated Clapton launched into a racist tirade supporting far-right politician Enoch Powell. During the outburst, he repeatedly used slurs, urged the audience to “keep Britain white,” and claimed the country was becoming a "black colony". This event served as a primary catalyst for the founding of the Rock Against Racism movement. While his early 1960s career was defined by his obsession with Black American blues, critics have retrospectively examined this as a "colonialist" appropriation in light of his later rhetoric. Decades later, Clapton faced renewed backlash for his anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine positions during the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing songs like “Stand and Deliver” and “This Has Gotta Stop,” and suggesting that those following medical guidance were victims of "mass formation hypnosis". In later years, he admitted to being “a nasty person” and “full-tilt racist” during the 1970s, as well as confessing to domestic abuse against his former wife Pattie Boyd during that same era." - Google Search summary 2026-02-06 USA afternoon

Yes, it is normal Twitter and normal Reddit since at least Q4 2014. More than 11 years. People on Reddit can not recognize their own media enviornment spreading to other venues and media platforms, White House podium media channels.

I was building social media systems in my parent's basement at age 15 and selling them. The Fortress BBS 219 area code. I was working training material for Telos Federal Systems in military networking of NAVY sonar drones at age 16 on DEC VAX/VMS systems. https://www.dcvintagewatches.com/product-page/cold-war-1988-magnavox-dropping-sonobuoys-anti-subwarfare-sonobuoy-advert Even before that, I was networking personal computers of POTS networks with my own dedicated 24-hour line peer to peer on 8-bit Commodore systems. IBM sold the entire world on OS/2 being the next big two-vendor operating system (IBM PC-DOS vs. Microsoft MS-DOS, two source code compatible sources like is done in CPU and other chip industries, license out fabrication to multiple vendors for support and supply chain diversity). Extended Edition and LAN Server from IBM were things Microsoft staff knew zero about. At Slater Steel in Fort Wayne https://www.facebook.com/groups/truefwhistory/posts/939014080082963/ and https://www.kpcnews.com/article_706065e4-d5e5-5a6f-b826-0b9304ccb35d.html , I was using DB2/2 on OS/2 to IBM AS/400 - all products Microsoft staff had no comprehensions of. I introduced PARTS on OS/2 and flew to Glendale California for training conferences. https://www.OS2world.com/wiki/index.php/Part_3:_Digitalk%27s_PARTS:_Parts_Assembly_and_Reuse_Tool_Set. At SAP I was was working with every variation of Unix and hardware vendor client/server for R/3 - all before Microsoft staff had TCP/IP experience. 

I did't just come from Microsoft BASIC 2.0 on a Commodore 64 and BASIC 7.0 on Commodore 128 (compiled with https://www.scribd.com/document/405779565/Blitz-BASIC-Compiler-for-the-Commodore-128-pdf Blitz). I came from Military Ada training on VAX/VMS, SAP R/3 on dozens of Unix platforms, from IBM AS/400. Even back in Fort Wayne, before SAP, I worked with RS/6000 server operations at Eagle Pitcher as a night operator and could do what I wanted with Unix. My university Purdue Fort Wayne, was a DEC VAX/VMS shop as was my high school, Snider High. As was my high school job at Telos, I had the free Microvax II system 1985 http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/uvax.html all night and weekends with 24 hour office access, my own office keys and root / sysadmin. It was a classroom system, all the Telos staff worked on-site at Magnavox https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/11/Magnavox-guilty-of-defense-contract-spying/2019655617600/ so the training system was idle at night and weekends for me to study and any books I wanted to order, Telos paid for. I would sit there reading military industry tech magazines for minimum wage at night and weekends, take operating system books and trade journals home and read at high school.

All that before I had ever stepped foot in the Pacific Northwest / Redmond area. And 18 months leading the Microsoft servers call center in Garland Texas for Software Spectrum before I relocated to the Bellevue office of Egghead consulting https://www.Spokesman.com/stories/1996/apr/14/egghead-deal-paves-way-for-software-spectrum acquired by Software Spectrum consulting as the highest-level consultant working as a peer to Microsoft consulting. The existing Bellevue office staff were Lotus Notes IBM software guys, I got along great, we used Lotus Notes at SAP. I was an OS/2 published author. 

Thanksgiving 1996 I was settled in and we got a call from the big boys at MCS specifically requesting me to go visit Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft's, office. Bill Gates could have sent any number of Microsoft employees over to the founder's office... but they sent me because I had worked on an independent Exchange Server book and had taught staff at Microsoft for call center support (2 week course, 8 hour days, server at every desk, typically 15 to 20 students, solo teaching) in Redmond in February 1996 (my virgin trip to PNW, in final testing months, before June 11, 1996 release of Exchange Server) and had good teacher ratings by my Microsoft employee students.

I was sent to Atlanta during the Olympics teaching Georgia Pacific staff. It was the same two week course we used for support staff at Software Spectrum (and Microsoft employees in Redmond I had taught). I was there in Atlanta intermediate weekend Saturday, July 27, 1996 when the bomb went off, and my girlfriend (future wife) Tristan was freaked out calling me. Still remember those calls. Tristan and I relocated from Garland and Anna Texas to Kirkland Washington after my 18 months Garland call center agreement was over. August 1996 IIRC.

It was November 20 or so... a week or so before Thanksgiving 1996 and Paul Allen was still stuck on a pre-release version of Exchange Server since the June 11, 1996 release date. Nobody in Microsoft wanted to develop a pre-release to final release upgrade procedure. They telephoned my office and asked for consultation. I visited their office, reviewed their servers...  I said I could do it in the time Paul Allen was flying across the Atlantic ocean on Thanksgiving day when he didn't have TCP/IP or private connectivity on his private jets mid-ocean in 1996 yet. We upgraded that in 1997.... Vegas trade show trip to find the latest airline products.

Anyway... Thanksgiving gig went perfect. Shortly after, they offered me a job as a direct employee running Paul's internal messaging. Bypassing my Texas employer, BTW.

One thing about being professional paid **technical editor** and classroom teacher, which I got the paid gig for correcting a guy's book for free about IBM OS/2... there is no bullshiting technical writing. If the VAX/VMS manual says something works one way, and you have all night on Friday night at Telos on the MicroVAX II... you learn your reading comprehension. If the commands and programs don't run right, you didn't understand the English. RTFM. Finnegans Wake, James Joyce ;) But man, do you fucking get mental burning reading Reddit comments and it took Joyce 17 fucking years of metaphor to metaphor systems integration of Quran to Bible to Upanishads and looping the monomyths.

Reddit users always think blackmail, money, "documents" on every cult member. Fox News HDTV does not have document on every audience cult member. Mecca does not have documents on every Quran cult member. Reddit commenting section does not have blackmail on every Reddit cult member. Media ecology learning from Marshall McLuhan is essential to rescue USA population from this simplistic thinking about blackmail and "dirt" as the motivation for Trumpism and MAGA. The NATO Ukraine Canada Greenland Venezuela self-harm behavior is not driven by blackmail or bribes as much as mythological storytelling of the Rupert Murdoch and Surkov order!

To assume it is a human running the mindsets from the White House...

Hate messages just mysteriously appear on information systems.

* “a **peek-a-boo world, where now this event, now that, pops into view for a moment, then vanishes again**. It is an improbable world. It is **a world in which the idea of human progress, as Bacon expressed it**, has been replaced by the idea of technological progress. The aim is **not to reduce ignorance, superstition, and suffering** but to accommodate ourselves to the requirements of new technologies. We tell ourselves, of course, that such accommodations will **lead to a better life**, but that is only the rhetorical residue of a vanishing technocracy. We are a culture **consuming itself with information**, and many of us do not even wonder how to control the process. We proceed under the assumption that information is our friend, believing that cultures may suffer grievously from a lack of information, which, of course, they do. It is **only now beginning to be understood that cultures may also suffer grievously from information glut**, information without meaning, information without control mechanisms.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. year 1992.

Reddit users hide their real names, real faces, real workplace names, real cities... If you want to see cowardly use of media, see the people afraid to quote real nonfiction sources. Trump is incredibly media brave. Stop thinking he is afraid of attention and bad publicity.

Trump understands NYC Edward Bernays. Trump understands NYC Manhattan Neil Postman. Fred Trump understood.

* Shared by Irshad Salim: “We are completely immune to advertising, do you know why? It’s all good news.” “Why do we find real news to be bad news? Because it tells the truth… I suggest that the reason we like bad news is (that) **it gives us a huge Survivor emotion**… we’re glad we’re not them there…” -Marshall McLuhan Kenneth Allsop interviews the world’s leading media theorist, Marshall McLuhan – the author of The Mechanical Bride, The Gutenberg Galaxy, Understanding Media, and The Medium is The Massage – about his theories of mass communication. Originally broadcast 19 August, 1971: https://despardes.com/marshall-mcluhan-on-good-news-bad-news-advertising/

Reddit audiences posting and shit-posting and shit-commenting get peer with Trump... "it gives us a huge Survivor emotion" That's the CORE of democracy. ANYONE can become Internet famous for shit-posting a meme. And Reddit users feel as described August 19, 1971: "it gives us a huge Survivor emotion"

* "The sense of this, it seemed to me, might be that from above or below, or from any point of the compass, the creative Word might be heard, which is the great thesis of democracy. Democracy assumes **that anybody from any quarter can speak**, and speak truth, because his mind is not cut off from the truth. All he has to do is clear out his passions and then speak." - 1988, Power Of Myth. https://www.GreatSealUSA.com/

Anyone can post a shit-post on the Internet!!! And the more FICTION it is, the more Reddit will front-page the bullshit shit-postings. Reddit is **a cult venue** of Trump bullshit media / content.

* "There is no question but that Hitler belongs in the category of the truly mystic medicine man. As somebody commented about him at the last Nürnberg party congress, since the time of Mohammed nothing like it has been seen in this world. His body does not suggest strength. The outstanding characteristic of his physiognomy is its dreamy look. I was especially struck by that when I saw pictures taken of him in the Czechoslovakian crisis; there was in his eyes the look of a seer. This markedly **mystic characteristic of Hitler's is what makes him do things which seem to us illogical, inexplicable, and unreasonable**. ... So you see, Hitler is a medicine man, a spiritual vessel, a demi-deity or, even better, **a myth**." - 
During an interview with H. R. Knickerbocker, first published in Hearst's International Cosmopolitan (**January 1939**), in which Dr. Carl G. Jung was asked to diagnose Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin.

CONTEXT ASSERTION, IMPORTANT INFORMATION: 

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests — and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2026: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1qy0wc3/trump_faces_backlash_over_racist_video_portraying/o40goj7/

Yes, they care. Trump is an entertainer. Fiction storytelling is Putin and Trump's system. Fandoms of fiction on Reddit and all over the USA care that their fiction entertainment is attracting audiences to comment upon it. Fandom vs. fandom. It's content for the cults of celebrity. People on Reddit will not see their own attraction to bad guys in fiction storytelling.

https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1qy0wc3/trump_faces_backlash_over_racist_video_portraying/o40i4pp/

Hate-watching of content has taken over every area of society. If anyone is recorded and uploaded on camera acting odd or unusual or stressed out, it's content for video distribution Reddit. Trump is a celebrity and actor doing acting and popular as a hate subject. The audience is the problem. Fandoms giving up power to machine addictions of delivery format and delivery venue are the problem. Hate is the mind-altering substance that attracts We The People to give up power and wealth to an attractive source of content creation, Trump and his supporting actors. Surkov won since March 2013.

https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1qy0wc3/trump_faces_backlash_over_racist_video_portraying/o40e77r/

All fandoms now in USA 2026 prize hate. People in year 2012 and earlier often prized education, learning, understanding and not just attracted to hate. But now it is all one common attraction. Hate vs. hate. Fandom vs. fandom. Hate-watchers of Reddit got their prized hate content and can mock and hate other fandoms.

Denial of Ukraine war, denial that lies and falsehoods are all over Reddit, denial of so much to fixate on the story that Trump tells... it is TRUMP's talking point that black people are the problem. And Reddit people have put that into their minds. It is the POPULATION that can't stop fucking talking about god damn Trump / ICE / MAGA and turn THE POPULATION attention to Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction serious books.

https://old.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleofReddit/comments/1qy64za/no_wonder_the_toddler_is_unhinged_once_again_the/o41m5ry/

To understand why Trump has so much power, this is part of the reason. Cult behavior so that only Obama can rescue. Kamala Harris or thousands of other qualified leaders can't do the job, only icons people already are locked into. The whole point of a Vice President replacing a President and such is that the job is a job. But people have used "the media", media systems, to become cult members and team-sports "winner takes all" logic. Millions of people can work at restaurants and run them successfully all over the USA. But people can't imagine 2000 or 3000 people qualified to be a good governor of California or leader of USA. We are a nation of 0.34 billion out of a planet o 8 billion people. Yet, our thinking is narrow and small-minded ideas.

A Reddit user that does not comprehend information warfare taking place on Reddit. A failure to teach media ecology from Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman to a society. People fail to see patterns in media and thinking changes in year 2013 to favor simple-think Tweet-length commenting and to avoid serious nonfiction learning.

https://old.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/1qy2ivs/mrw_mike_tyson_was_on_fox_news_today_saying_hes/o42492s/

Mike Tyson is a fame-seeking celebrity who admires Trump's celebrity. The reason Reddit is talking about both people is because of their celebrity. And Fox News knows how to brew celebrity into the minds of audiences, including celebrity fandoms on Reddit. This is all media ecology topics of Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan that Reddit society is not self-aware of... and acting compulsively towards pro-violence anti-diplomacy Mike Tyson

Instead of promoting brain-damage causing fight as cool and popular, culture needs to look at the ignorance celebration that powers MAGA and the cult of Fox News ignorance. Comedy and amusement and watching videos of men avoiding the public library is kind of Trump breeding ground of the mind. Physical and power domination over women.

* “Americans no longer talk to each other, they entertain each other. They do not exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions; they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.

Vince Gilligan's February 15, 2025 WGA speech about Walter White being seen as a cool awesome character.... Trump plays a character. Boxing is done in a rectangle. Simple mindsets.

But that does not explain why all the supposedly "SANE PEOPLE" in "the other party" can not stop commenting about Trump every day and every hour of those days on social media computer systems. Over and over, for over a decade, commenting about how fat, ugly, orange, dumb, stupid, idiot Donald Trump is. WHY ARE SOCIAL MEDIA USERS NOT EDUCATING PEOPLE? Why are NONFICTION BOOKS that explain what is going on in detail and verbose rich complex understanding IGNORED in favor of short-commenting shit-talk messages like the Reddit comment I am highlighting and sharing here on GitHub?

What the fuck does orange cosmetic makeup have to do with the evils and poor thinking of Donald Trump? it's superficial and banal, just like REDDIT COMMENTING IS. Judging people based on shallow surface concerns is the crisis! Skin color of black! Skin color of brown! Spoken language of Spanish or English or even how I, as an autistic, compose my fucking paragraphs and the word choices I make!

WHY ARE SOCIAL MEDIA USERS NOT ASSERTING AND QUOTING Dr. Bandy X Lee? If ONLY MAGA is insane by media mania of high-speed Twitter and Reddit, why are REDDIT USERS not wanting to TREAT PEOPLE who are "INSANE"? Why are people not teaching serious and detailed cult deprogramming and how to address the crisis of Fox News HDTV media mind patterns and mental outcomes?


https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1qyc2a9/from_epstein_to_bezos_the_ruling_class_is_rotten/o42gvaa/

And I was there when it all started. 1996 Bellevue Washington. Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 release. I was a published author, lifelong expert in social media. Hired to work for the co-founder of Microsoft as a Principal consultant from Software Spectrum in Garland, Texas (where I worked on the book and got certified as a MCSE and certified instructor for Microsoft Exchange). I was $250.00 an hour billable ($532/hour inflation adjusted 2026) in Bellevue, Washington working as a salaried employee for Software Spectrum Consulting in 1996. After doing a critical job for Paul Allen's personal intranet private social media... I was hired as an insider to work 10 doors down from Paul Allen and Vern Raburn (another legend in the industry, Lotus 1-2-3). I managed owner social networks to the NBA Portland Trailblazers, I managed the new owner integration with NFL Seattle Seahawks and met personally in the offices of Coach Mike Hologram and his IT staff. I was on call 24 hours a day as the in-house media systems / information systems expert for all the holdings for 2.5 years. These were no ordinary years. 1997 / 1998 / 1999 when Bill Gates and Paul Allen were DOUBLING WEALTH in a SINGLE YEAR! They could have hired any number of Microsoft employees or ex-employees to have Edward Snowden level access to Paul Allen's private messages and travel records of message access. But they hired me at age 27. 

Allen did not want Gates-loyal people having his personal messages and communications records at the Edward Snowden level. SEE_ALSO https://www.CNET.com/home/smart-home/paul-allen-gates-ballmer-tried-to-rip-me-off/ - I came with Telos Federal Systems (Pentagon military industrial complex) VAX/VMS age 16 Fort Wayne, Snider High School VAX/VMS, Purdue University at Fort Wayne VAX/VMS background, IBM AS/400 Slater Steel Fort Wayne DB/2 OS/2, Fort Wayne OS/2 Users Group founder, SAP R/3 (IBM Unix, Sun Unix, HP-UX Unix) on my work history. I was not a Microsoft insider and had never worked for any employee in the PNW. I was under employment of Garland Texas (DFW area). All my published books were as third-party, from major industry-independent book companies, not from insider Microsoft knowledge.

Can you imagine if Paul Allen's private e-mail between the Trailblazers, Microsoft Board of Directors, or Seattle Seahawks had been leaked out of the insecure and poor version 1.0 release of a Microsoft Server product? My name would have been on the front page of Seattle Times in a heartbeat! Just imagine the ridicule of having a Microsoft co-founder sports team owner e-mails leaked because of how shitty and poorly designed Exchange Server network security was and how inexperienced Microsoft was at enterprise security! Competitors to Microsoft Redmond at Novell Utah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell and big iron producers and Unix Sun and OpenBSD / Linux would have LOVED to see the Trailblazers, Seahawks, Paul Allen have a private message leak / breach about purchasing the team and hiring players! Sports fanatics are ruthless for leaks.

Microsoft Exchange Server was a security nightmare and people poorly understood the very unique product https://www.SecurityArchitecture.com/is-clintons-use-of-a-private-email-server-a-big-deal-or-not/ , and I was sitting on the publicized bragging Seattle pot of gold of all pots of sports-team gold in 1997. I did not have a single friend or known co-worker  in Seattle, I was a TOTAL outsider, only my girlfriend from Texas who moved with me. Who I was supporting, she was unemployed her first year in Kirkland. She had lost her house in a fire in Texas which broke her relationship with her step-mother and was starting her life over.

* "Paul Allen continued to serve as a key member of the Microsoft Board of Directors, a position he held from 1990 until 2000. While holding this board seat, he focused on outside investments, founding Vulcan Productions in 1997 and purchasing the NFL's Seattle Seahawks that same year." - Google Search Summary,

REPEATING_REPEATER REPHRASING_REPEATING Paul Allen had connections to Microsoft-experienced people from all over the world. He hired me, a complete outsider the very year the wealth went CRAZY with a unproven in the field product. Exchange Serve 1.0 / 4.0 flagship! Because I didn't take shit from billionaires, no matter who the fuck you were, and no Bill Gates lackey was going to fuck-over Paul Allen because my Telos Federal Systems Apprentice job-creation (Fort Wayne branch, Santa Monica California HQ in 1986) background was fact-checked. I was a zero-bullshit mature 27 year old. IBM had made me their HIGHEST LEVEL Social Media ambassador, "Team OS/2 Gold Ambassador" at an Indy 500 weekend ceremony. I was not Bill Gates loyal. Again, again, see: 1982 behind-back screwing-over history https://www.Forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/03/30/bill-gates-tried-to-screw-paul-allen-whats-the-surprise/ - THAT is why they hired an computer industry outsider whose father ran a Pepsi canning plant and had zero connections to the software and tech industry insiders.

Neil Postman, in turn, was a "critical heir" to McLuhan, building on media ecology to analyze the cultural, social, and educational effects of technology, often extending McLuhan’s analysis of television into the realms of politics and education." - Google Search summary 2026-02-07 morning USA, Saturday morning.

Reddit tech addicts are in the manipulated mindsets and can not see the NATO forest for the USA trees. The billionaire Putin put Surkov fiction authoring in charge, leaping ahead of everything Neil Postman and McLuhan have done. Nobody is **media woke** to the situaiton except Peter P! And Peter P does not invoke { Rick Roderick, Howard Bloom, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman }!!!

* “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992

That is why I am so fucking deeply emotional over the Reddit PLUR1BUS Apple TV+ December 2025 / January 2026 fandom. "Vilified". Walter White and Saul Goodman fandom on the Internet cesspool.

That's because Reddit fandom of Trump and Reddit fandom of Epstein entertainment systems can't follow a WOMAN named Dr. Bandy X Lee **who published a nonfiction compilation book on October 3, 2017 that every damn person with tech social media skills to comment should be quoting on Reddit over and over and repeating again and again!!!**

She fucking compiled 27 different writing authors into one book for Reddit community to quote. But people can not stop the compulsive mockery to Trump / ICE / MAGA / Putin / Musk to turn to a woman GenX leader. Is her GenX laugh too much like GenX Kamala Harris laugh for Reddit? Are all 27 authors not good enough for Reddit? Or does REDDIT SOCIETY have a fucking nonfiction engagement issue?

“Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

It's the opposite. Bamboozle egoism, pain of truth. Pain of facing that Fox News HDTV is fiction. Pain of facing that Bible and Church are science fiction, as is the Quran 9/11 Mohammad inspiration. All fiction storytelling.

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241

Trump is tricked by Putin and Reddit user's can describe the timelines or names of the tricksters in Russia that have bamboozled everyone. Donald Trump trusts Putin and people in USA trust Trump.

No matter what Trump and Putin do, the important thing to USA Internet users, the entire society, is superficial and banal call-out about syntax. people don't read stories, they react to Tweets. This is why Trump wins. 500 short tiny antics works on minds that don't want a clear progressive working together with diverse language and arrangements. High-speed wrecks when even the slightest out of alignment is encountered. So fast in intake it blows out minds. Speedeating politics. Surkov students can blow minds, micro-blowing of minds with the most trivial patterns of communications.

As I have made a central theme on this  GitHub project... fiction outsells nonfiction. Nobody is going to censor a popular scene in a science fiction story like Star Wars Andor year 2025 or Quran science fiction story from year 635. People can keep discussing a Star Wars scene or a page of Mohammad's Quran fiction. This loophole is actively being utilized. Fox News HDTV can claim it is { amusement, entertainment, comedy, SNL Weekend Update, fantasy mythos }.

Many on Reddit can't fathom or interpret beyond the TLDR barrier, ELI4 barrier, and fiction vs. nonfiction barriers. Shuffle syntax of language usage around and audiences on SubReddits are compulsively attracted to Donald Trump styles of mocking.

"The lies", that's fiction storytelling - Reddit audiences love discussing fiction plot points and scenes in Lord of the Rings, Star Wars Andor, Fallout video game and TV... but when it comes to nonfiction from.

It is EVERY MINUTE of EVERY DAY AND NIGHT that I keep having to rephrase and repeat... It is not just politics topics. It is music industry topics, it is food supply topics. Trumpism is Reddit itself. No-identity hate-prizing social media that is hive mind mob mentality of Reddit. Reddit social behavior has been ahead of he curve. In year 2015 Reddit users were behaving as MAGA population behaved in 2018. The mindsets of tech love, machine love, video gaming as training ground to seek out weakness and attack the weak... to use mental health as a peer to peer insult topic like Trump does with I.Q. numbers being low. Anything to avoid the set of values Malala laid upon the world stage in year 2013. Anything to avoid Jen Senko's brainwashing serious discussions... anything to avoid Dr. Bandy x Lee's serious 27 leaders compiled and published October 3, 2017.

The desire to turn all into jokes, joke-wash trump and fixate on the surface above the skin being orange.. and "Deep" topics of diapers... exceeds any desire to rescue from Russia defeating NATO ad USA Pentagon in psychological warfare to self-harm the USA with anti-intellectualism.

Reddit users can't engage nonfiction on the subject that's been there for years and years.

* “Conspiracy theories have long been used to maintain power: the Soviet leadership saw capitalist and counter-revolutionary conspiracies everywhere; the Nazis, Jewish ones. But those conspiracies were ultimately there to buttress an ideology, whether class warfare for Communists or race for Nazis. With today’s regimes, which struggle to formulate a single ideology – indeed, which can’t if they want to maintain power by sending different messages to different people – the idea that one lives in a world full of conspiracies becomes the world view itself. Conspiracy does not support the ideology; it replaces it. In Russia this is captured in the catchphrase of the country’s most important current affairs presenter: ‘A coincidence? I don’t think so!’ says Dmitry Kiselev as he twirls between tall tales that dip into history, literature, oil prices and colour revolutions, which all return to the theme of how the world has it in for Russia. And as a world view it grants those who subscribe to it certain pleasures: if all the world is a conspiracy, then your own failures are no longer all your fault. The fact that you achieved less than you hoped for, that your life is a mess – it’s all the fault of the conspiracy.
More importantly, conspiracy is a way to maintain control. In a world where even the most authoritarian regimes struggle to impose censorship, one has to surround audiences with so much cynicism about anybody’s motives, persuade them that behind every seemingly benign motivation is a nefarious, if impossible-to-prove, plot, that they lose faith in the possibility of an alternative, a tactic a renowned Russian media analyst called Vasily Gatov calls **‘white jamming’**. And the end effect of this endless pile-up of conspiracies is that you, the little guy, can never change anything. For if you are living in a world where shadowy forces control everything, then what possible chance do you have of turning it around? In this murk it becomes best to rely on a strong hand to guide you. ‘Trump is our last chance to save America,’ **is the message of his media hounds**. Only Putin can ‘raise Russia from its knees’. ‘The problem we are facing today is less oppression, more lack of identity, apathy, division, no trust,’ sighs Srdja. ‘There are more tools to change things than before, but there’s less will to do so.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality.

"For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that **it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by techn**ological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

“Shaw once remarked that all professions are conspiracies against the laity. I would go further: in Technopoly, all experts are invested with the charisma of priestliness. Some of our priest-experts are called psychiatrists, some psychologists, some sociologists, some statisticians. The god they serve does not speak of righteousness or goodness or mercy or grace. Their god speaks of efficiency, precision, objectivity. And that is why such concepts as sin and evil disappear in Technopoly. They come from a moral universe that is irrelevant to the theology of expertise. And so the priests of Technopoly call sin “social deviance,” which is a statistical concept, and they call evil “psychopathology,” which is a medical concept. Sin and evil disappear because they cannot be measured and objectified, and therefore cannot be dealt with by experts.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992.

I have a theory that people ignore that Christian / Catholic organized religion hasn't been doing this for hundreds and hundreds of years. That people ignore what is going on right in their own high school classes at age 14, age 15 and age 16. I was a bookworm and I would read books in class and around the school and never spread gossip or rumors... so girls would talk right in front of me and you could hear hot girls bragging about the older men that were giving them adult experiences. 

I have a theory that people do not listen worth shit to what is truly going on in the world. Go study child custody battles, stories from divorce lawyers, court cases. All over the USA, this isn't geographic specific! Rural people have wild situations. Go to a bar and do your work on a laptop on weekday during happy hour and watch drunk drivers get into their car day after day, I did this in over 25 USA cities. People are blind to how people threaten other people with drunk driving and such. Billionaire corporations, investors pay for all that advertising to program booze / beer addictions into people. The most powerful manipulation messages possible to make people obese, alcoholics, etc.

Putin's **Saint Peter**sburg Internet Research Agency has programmed self-harm to USA population since March 2013. Not just Trump, not just Musk, not just MAGA, not just Republicans, everyone. And people are blind that hate is prized and entirely avoiding Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's lessons about out-group hate. Today is Sunday, Bible School, Church Day, people can't read in February 2026 worth a fucking damn a science fiction story and what it has to say.

The 1954 Equation

Sunday, February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

We all have eating disorders. We are constantly bombarding ourselves in USA with food advertisement and marketing. Banksy is correct. Because we have such terrible health care system in USA, we "eat our feelings" under the stress of red tape / insurance paperwork. USA created Google advertising, Facebook advertising, TV channel, Hollywood - we are bombarding our brains with stimulation to over-eat constantly.  Our education on nutrition is indoctrination with a McDonald's Happy Meal. Fast Food and junk food are cults and our church is praise to brand-name processed food. That is our food culture since 1980.

* "this new discourse is **even more totalitarian** because behind it hides the same mechanisms of power… not the same… but behind it **hides mechanisms of power** which keep these people in their sway. Ah, I think that one of the greatest examples of this – for me – is the **discourse concerning body weight in women**; bulimia, anorexia and so on. It’s as though a male dominant society was able in the Middle Ages to, you know, put a chastity belt on a woman, to put, you know, to… **keep food away from her and starve her if she misbehaved**. But today we accomplish the same feat through **images that are constantly bombarded into the conscious and into the unconscious** of women, and they perform the wonderfully humanistic task of starving themselves to death while male therapists teach them how to get on twelve step programs to eat. See, for Foucault, this is why its not humanism. This kind of malady is a cultural malady that strikes at the very heart of life. **Once something like eating is death then you have struck at the very heart of life**. The enemy of the older radical theories may have been the ruling class, but today the stakes of whether we will reform ourselves into a new kind of human being, a new kind of society, whether we will find selves worth being… the stakes of it are simply life itself.

This is what the USA population is doing with spare time and free time first thing Monday morning. What is AVOIDED: commenting about Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book of 27 people writing about the mental health of Donald Trump and the national mental health. https://www.GoodReads.com/author/quotes/16953723.Bandy_X_Lee Published October 3, 2017. Avoided and avoided because Reddit commenting is a fandom to hate-watching Kid Rock and Trump hate-watching. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching

The Bible is not North American. The Bible is not in the USA Constitution. The Founding Fathers were deism / deists. The Bible is from the Middle East which has a world wide reputation of war and hate. There is a mental health crisis that people believe they 'see god" and "hear Jesus" in their head. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" addresses all that is wrong with this Kid Rock statement to USA. "I love Jesus" is wrong, read "1 John 4:20". Thinking you have seen Jesus or seen God is wrong. "1 John 4:20" Bible verse. Literacy hallucination crisis. Hamlet's Ghost reading literacy crisis. You have not seen Hamlet's Ghost. Re-read Bible verse "1 John 4:20" and apply it to Hamlet's Ghost. Or Star Wars "Force Ghosts" of 1977 fiction film!

The avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 writers on mental health since October 3, 2017 by Reddit commenting creators is a major symptom.

"mental illness"

What are the mechanics of billions of people all across the world getting this mental illness? Is it food issue, some mind-altering substance of medication they are all taking? This is a woman talking about "God" and "the left" in her video. Where did she learn to divide all people into "right" and "left", is that in The Bible somewhere, or did it come from a King in France and has nothing to do with USA politics, but people parrot it as if it is the ultimate mental mindset of how to measure the world.

Why does she believe in a Levant God and Santa? Do people indoctrinate their children? When does the "mental illness" begin?

Reddit community has no concern to ponder if anyone else had ever had a thought before today. "The far right really are unhinged and suffering from mental illness at this point." At what point did the Russian far-right in Moscow against Ukraine go too far? What point did the Taliban go too far in Pakistan?

On September 11, 2001 - did the far-right in Saudi Arabia go to a point to far? Did everyone notice? Exactly what mental health treatment and solutions were tried, or were only military weapon systems and armed airport security measures taken? Which mental health leader took on 9/11?

I think Reddit community has a massive **media cult** problem. The crisis is that people are so conditioned to write original commenting up n every serious problem that nobody actually gets on the same page of a topic for very long. If on the same page, ever! **"Cult of original unique comments"**, rephrasing similar observations in unique ways so that We The People never actually reach any kind of shared comprehension on serious matters.

I'm rephrasing the same fucking thing on this GitHub over and over and over and over to point out the absence of a FAQ, Wiki, nonfiction published book. Oh wait, there are nonfiction books already published! There are several. But the crisis seems to be that people want to engage commenting and touch screens and avoid paper printed books with any sense of rescue, urgency, need to change direction towards goodness.

Yes. If you can't entertain people and charm them like Donald Trump entertains everyone, you are a non-person. If you aren't famous and celebrity like Donald Trump, you are considered a waste of space in life. The population prizes entertainment addictions so much you see people in public staring into meme devices even when other people are with them. People program so much billionaire content into their brains in USA year 2026 that has them favor self-harm to the Earth and all life on Earth. Gun worship to fix health care, Luigi praising, and other weapon system values are widespread. People in USA will block you, silence you, burn your books and papers if you communicate outside their Reddit and Bluesky expected patterns. Fox News influence, including second-hand influence, Newsmax influence, ... words no longer work to describe how dehumanizing and toxic popularity has become.

Anti-FAQ anti-Wiki information society of Reddit prizes questions as "engagement" commenting above all else. Organizing important information on serious topics is consistently avoided. Dr. Bandy X Lee's compilation of 27 mental health people since October 3, 2017 is ignored on Bluesky and Reddit because it is not entertaining enough to meme about.

https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1r0etsz/irish_man_with_valid_us_work_permit_held_in_ice/o4hq03e/

Asking questions on social media as a form of low-effort engagement commenting. Very popular. Why are people not recognizing that MAGA / Trump / Reddit is a cult of ICE content? And why isn't mental health professional Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership of 27 professions constantly not repeated on Reddit comment section to rescue hearts and minds from self-harm? Why do people spend their free time and spare time on Reddit commenting over each ICE action in a reactionary way - instead of teaching and educating the general public ABOUT the mental health behaviors of hate?

People are pretending that the avoidance and hostility towards Dr. Bandy X Lee's publications all over the internet is normal. That calling individual people { insane, mentally unwell, crazy, sick, retarded } all the time on social media while avoiding recognizing it isn't just one person, Putin, harming Ukraine but an entire society. It isn't just one mental health sickness in organize hate groups. It isn't just a hand full of people avoiding nonfiction from Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 writers... it's constant on Bluesky and Reddit. Go look for subscribers and hashtags on Bluesky...

Fiction Superman isn't a real man or person. The Bible verse "1 John 4:20" crisis in USA population is very real. The avoidance of nonfiction teaching for adults, reading nonfiction books and matching up other people's written ideas to real-world situations is observable. The addiction to low-effort commenting over and over on meme devices is observable and self-evident.

People are incapable of identifying cult behaviors. Smartphones are in every city, regardless of nation. Tall buildings like Trump prizes make people bow and respect. An impressive looking automobile bling bling gets attention, etc. We have common mental values and we don't teach these things in our education systems, we let advertising and marketing manipulate our minds without any concern as to negative side-effects.

Low-effort commenting and Truth Social messages of mocking.... the technique of making mocking statements is what put Trump and Putin to the top in mindset programming.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59
