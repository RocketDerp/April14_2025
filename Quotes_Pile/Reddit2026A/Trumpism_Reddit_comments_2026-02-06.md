Nothing about the predictable commenting abut Trump after a decade is surprising. Top upvoted, 1 year Reddit account. Zero self-awareness of not resisting education and teaching. Just lazy commenting that will not break the "game loop" of Reddit minds in the Russian screen game

* "what Putin will do next — that he’s unpredictable and thus dangerous. We’re rendered stunned, spun, and flummoxed by the Kremlin’s weaponization of absurdity and unreality.” - year 2014. September 9, 2014 https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

What is most important about that quote is the date. September 9 is before November election date. By years. Yet, the population has abandoned nonfiction learning in favor of Trump artwork and antics.

Tuesday, September 9, 2014 publication day   
Tuesday, June 16, 2015 Trump campaign start day  
Tuesday, November 8, 2016 election day   

Every day I encounter minds that behave like this Reddit comment. Trump is a source of "locker room talk", Trump's ability to amuse and create laughs for fandoms far exceeds anyone's desire to travel the world, raise children, do anything but chuckle all day an night on their smartphone about how dumb idiot stupid we all are now. Superbowl billionaire celebration is coming up. I helped purchase the Seahawks for Jody Allen. I interviewed the coach and players briefly one on one in their office and on the practice field. The Experience Music Project, Experience Sports Owner Project, Experience ESPN Hosting Project... I had any research and learning tool I could ever need.

Eternal September late 1993 and early 1994 never ended. I had a background in social media with The Fortress in 219 area code an from-scratch Commodore 128 app I had developed and sold commercially. I was a believer in open Usenet like I was a believer in open SMTP e-mail. But, I have to admit, nobody ever noticed, including me. That Microsoft Exchange Server used used SMTP for e-mail but did not use NNTP for Public Folders. The "social media" was proprietary and had no convention to share with outside world. The e-mail did, but not the social media.

I used Fark and Slashdot, but I did not see Reddit and Twitter and Facebook coming. We all knew video like YouTube was coming, but we never imagined that Usenet OPEN social media would fade away. I still remember when the Deja Vu archive was offline. https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/business/new-economy-google-s-revival-usenet-archive-opens-up-wealth-possibilities-but.html

The progress of Internet speed and CPU speed alone and mobile networks was what I focused on instead. Travel and working from home office since Thanksgiving 1999. But I came home from living in South America the day after Katrina hit South Florida "South Florida Landfall: Katrina made its first U.S. landfall on August 25, 2005, at approximately 6:30 p.m. EDT". I still remember, because we had a new RV waiting for housing and we could not get car insurance, they banned sales of car insurance in Florida. So we couldn't move into our pre-arranged housing after flying in to Miami. My mom and dad were retired and living in The Villages, but my wife and I both worked from home and had the TV all planned out. It ended up being just a 1 day delay as we managed to get insurance out of Texas address and take delivery of the new RV off the dealer lot.

Leisure Travel Free Spirit 210B 3S (model year 2006) was our new home office. Canadian camper, European van. Back then, USA did not have tall roof vans yet.

Katrina was yet to hit New Orleans. We had been to NOLA before going to South America. When we had our 1987 Bluebird Wanderlodge PT40. You could sense the social turning point of Texas in 2006 when the city re-opened for Fat Tuesday 2006. https://www.splcenter.org/resources/reports/hurricane-katrina-racial-stigma/
