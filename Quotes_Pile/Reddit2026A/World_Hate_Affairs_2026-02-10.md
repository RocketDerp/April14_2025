Reddit fandom to Trump does the same thing. 1. Hate-watch Trump constantly for notification to comment as fast as possible on meme platforms. 2. Describe Trump's behavior for social media peers. 3. Do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }. 4. Call MAGA a cult, call Fox News audience a cult... call hundreds of millions of out-group people cultists, but do not recognize the immediate Reddit cults to mocking and mockery. Media systems cultists all.

Reddit users swimming in low-effort commenting, avoiding the listed authors in the previous paragraph, can not see the attraction to Reddit commenting media people swim in.

If Donald Trump is so { stupid, moron, idiot, dumb } as so many say.. why is an entire population of nation, why is every media system churning out Trump content day and night since June 16, 2015 endlessly? Why are audiences flocking to, hanging upon, his every message and image? Reddit is a fandom to Trump's Reality TV Tony Clifton performance. Reddit fandom will use spare time and free time commenting over and over how stupid Trump is. The Reddit audience members will do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }.

In the social culture of the United States of America... it is a way to express dislike of individuals. It is about pecking order and grading people based upon their Donald Trump like ability to charm and manipulate others. Brown-nosing culture. Sucking up to the boss. Cult of doing social rituals to "respect in relationships".

Donald Trump has been the center of attention since June 16, 2015. Let that sink in, dear reader. People CHOOSE to make Trump in power. Not a small number of people. People are not protesting on social media. There is no blackout on Reddit and Bluesky calling for Trump's removal. Millions upon millions of people have married their children's future to Donald Trump as a boss man role model for male leaders.

The society is so sick and menally unwell at the organization and systemic level people do not even recognize there is any better way. Joe Biden was considered 4 years of "boring boss man", ,when Biden was not trying to be a boss at all. People think they work for the President of the government. There is no sense of goodness itself. The government is not our JOB. A country is not a business in competition.

It is the Winter Olympics in USA, and people behave like our country is a competition with other countries. Except we have a massive military and people think war is just another business strategy. The values and thinking are corrupt in We the People. Soul rot, spirit rot, brain rot.

Corporate America teaching more hate. HATE_BASED_ECONOMY is Trumpism USA. Hate one another. Hate thy enemy. Democracy does not work when people do not love one another. The dumb-ass idea that you must hate your ex-lover is exactly how Donald Trump leads the nation. So many followers of Donald Trump who think MAGA is better than everyone else with these *hate harder* values.

People do not grasp why Trump is in charge for so many years, since June 16, 2015 Trump has universal support in USA for values of hate-promoting and hate-teaching. People who hate Trump are supporters of hate! It never was funny, and no amount of joking will undo the Rupert Murdoch society values, Elon Musk society values, Donald Trump outcomes. Too much joking away as abuse that is called "love MAGA" is exactly the celebration of inequality.

Yes. the world. Why I paid my own way to live in Chile in South America, in Algeria in Africa, Jordan in Middle East, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cyprus, and all over USA to study media ecology and how people were describing real-world places vs. Internet. And the problem people do not discuss is { advertising, marketing, fiction addiction, religion science fiction confusion, "for the LOL" bullshitting, amusement and entertainment addictions }. Humanity is fooling itself with the idea that it is fun to hate, enjoyable to wage war, and thrilling to murder and kill in organized military. It is all a massive misunderstanding. The Tower of Babel metaphor is a very real and true problem.

I have given up my computing career despite my great successes... in favor of using my worst talent. Social skills, because the denial of goodness has become the worst problem of humanity. I have zero audience. It gives me constant brain damage and extreme pain to read Reddit comments day after day, but it is the crisis and peaceful way to address a very real and true crisis of thinking. I could be writing about video games or technical writing about WiFi routers for great money and still work from home... but this just pushes the world further and further away from humanism.

* "Why should there be hunger and privation in any land, in any city, at any table when man has the resources and the scientific know-how to provide all mankind with the basic necessities of life? Even deserts can be irrigated and top soil can be replaced. We cannot complain of a lack of land, for there are twenty-five million square miles of tillable land, of which we are using less than seven million. We have amazing knowledge of vitamins, nutrition, the chemistry of food, and the versatility of atoms. There is no deficit in human resources; the deficit is in human will. The well-off and the secure have too often become indifferent and oblivious to the poverty and deprivation in their midst. The poor in our countries have been shut out of our minds, and driven from the mainstream of our societies, because we have allowed them to become invisible. Just as nonviolence exposed the ugliness of racial injustice, so must the infection and sickness of poverty be exposed and healed — not only its symptoms but its basic causes. This, too, will be a fierce struggle, but **we must not be afraid to pursue the remedy no matter how formidable** the task." - December 11, 1964

No matter how much billionaires don't want us to call out the NFL Seattle Seahawks owner for the society mind programming of "health care games" that there is an army of medical doctors serving a tiny few sports stars.

Swimming in an ocean of sports-think competitive hate and competing for dehumanization of out-groups is never enjoyable or fun. The emotions people feel are all gross misunderstandings. Authentic joy and authentic fun and authentic happiness are only in recognition of Wiki and FAQ and how English language itself is formed not as laws to discard and reject human persons for their syntax and spelling errors...

* "Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. For **some strange reason** I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be — this is the **interrelated structure of reality**."

The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Malala doesn't have a lot of anti-terrorism supporters about young girls being given voices in Palestine or Egypt or North Africa or Iran (where girls are being abused systemically that people know recently from December 2025 onward protests). Malala's October 8, 2013 book has a lot of insight into mob mentality mindsets.

11 month Reddit account. Top-upvoted popular comment.

Instead of sounding alarm bells that we need cult deprogramming and the mass dehumanizing of women and girls is advancing, to get behind Malala's campaigns and support Dr. Bandy X Lee's focus on mental health education - a call to just ignore the problem. Avoiding the problem is not asserting goodness. Men need to be educated why hate of women is bad for the entire planet Earth. Clearly the clergy is teaching toxic values and remedial morality lessons are needed. Malala had excellent writings and teachings to share.

Reminder of context: This isn't just one man in USA. It is Rupert Murdoch cult fandom, Elon Musk Titter cult fandoms, Donald Trump Truth Social fandoms, etc. RFK Jr's pro-disease pro-measles, etc. Women are being systemically targeted by organized cults of men.

A STOCK source of laughter. LOL culture. Meme life. The Apple iPhone 1 venue since year 2007. When Trump got on Twitter venue July 6, 2011 at 2pm https://theOutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 is when it started! Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about high-speed media systems describes the issue in more detail, 184 pages.

* “For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. SEE_ALSO David Foster Wallace concept of "Infinite Jest", joke-jesting infinity black hole.

PEOPLE ON REDDIT WILL NOT FACE UP: What is Trump good at? is Donald Trump good at goodness? Is Trump helping MAGA people with health care? WHAT EXACTLY IS Donald Trump GOOD at except appearing on camera and generating laughter!!! Trump is playing a certain type of laughter source, a comedian character, named "Tony Clifton" - from Trump's own home town, NYC. NYC SNL comedy of "Tony Clifton".

Trump is a camera magnet. Center of attention! Trump got on McDonald's commercials with Grimace dollar menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4QNXnNftWk - Donald Trump got in Home Alone films in cinema. Donald Trump gets hot girls, hot women, and flew on a private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013 for Miss Universe Sexy Show! https://time.com/5251484/donald-trump-flight-records-moscow-trip/ - 

Being **a television influencer, a Twitter influencer, a Truth social influencer, a newspaper influencer, a socialite, popularity of pop culture** is what Donald Trump is good at! MEDIA ITSELF, creating MEDIA EVENTS, is the gift and talent of Donald J. Trump! An actor doing acting, playing POTUS Tony Clifton character for laughs! It concentrates power and wealth!

Ok, folks, **let's do the math**. "The world hates him", so Trump leads with hate and the world follows with hate. 8 billion people have adopted hate because of a leader of hate. The KKK, Ku Klux Klan is a hate organization. So, 100.000%, EVERYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD, the entire planet, is following Putin's leadership of hate using Trump as a front-man for Russia. That's what this short message on Reddit is saying...

That's the very problem. EVERY PERSON follows the leadership of Putin and Trump into hate! People are so addicted to the high-speed information system delivery of Trump content to hate-watch! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching That is the very social mechanism of Surkovian governing!

Surkov, Putin, Trump, Murdoch, Musk have CRACKED the 1954 Equation! Applied hate systems, Putin and Surkov mastered the monomyth information patterns of concentrating hate to exploit the sheep of the world! And all the sheep are following the hate-leadership pied pipers!

**The 1954 Equation**

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.
