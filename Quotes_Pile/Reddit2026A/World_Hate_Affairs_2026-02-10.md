Reddit fandom to Trump does the same thing. 1. Hate-watch Trump constantly for notification to comment as fast as possible on meme platforms. 2. Describe Trump's behavior for social media peers. 3. Do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }. 4. Call MAGA a cult, call Fox News audience a cult... call hundreds of millions of out-group people cultists, but do not recognize the immediate Reddit cults to mocking and mockery. Media systems cultists all.

Reddit users swimming in low-effort commenting, avoiding the listed authors in the previous paragraph, can not see the attraction to Reddit commenting media people swim in.
