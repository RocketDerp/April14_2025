Reddit fandom to Trump does the same thing. 1. Hate-watch Trump constantly for notification to comment as fast as possible on meme platforms. 2. Describe Trump's behavior for social media peers. 3. Do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }. 4. Call MAGA a cult, call Fox News audience a cult... call hundreds of millions of out-group people cultists, but do not recognize the immediate Reddit cults to mocking and mockery. Media systems cultists all.

Reddit users swimming in low-effort commenting, avoiding the listed authors in the previous paragraph, can not see the attraction to Reddit commenting media peoples swim in.

If Donald Trump is so { stupid, moron, idiot, dumb } as so many say.. why is an entire population of nation, why is every media system churning out Trump content day and night since June 16, 2015 endlessly? Why are audiences flocking to, hanging upon, his every message and image? Reddit is a fandom to Trump's Reality TV Tony Clifton performance. Reddit fandom will use spare time and free time commenting over and over how stupid Trump is. The Reddit audience members will do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }.

In the social culture of the United States of America... it is a way to express dislike of individuals. It is about pecking order and grading people based upon their Donald Trump like ability to charm and manipulate others. Brown-nosing culture. Sucking up to the boss. Cult of doing social rituals to "respect in relationships".

Donald Trump has been the center of attention since June 16, 2015. Let that sink in, dear reader. People CHOOSE to make Trump in power. Not a small number of people. People are not protesting on social media. There is no blackout on Reddit and Bluesky calling for Trump's removal. Millions upon millions of people have married their children's future to Donald Trump as a boss man role model for male leaders.

The society is so sick and menally unwell at the organization and systemic level people do not even recognize there is any better way. Joe Biden was considered 4 years of "boring boss man", ,when Biden was not trying to be a boss at all. People think they work for the President of the government. There is no sense of goodness itself. The government is not our JOB. A country is not a business in competition.

It is the Winter Olympics in USA, and people behave like our country is a competition with other countries. Except we have a massive military and people think war is just another business strategy. The values and thinking are corrupt in We the People. Soul rot, spirit rot, brain rot.

Corporate America teaching more hate. HATE_BASED_ECONOMY is Trumpism USA. Hate one another. Hate thy enemy. Democracy does not work when people do not love one another. The dumb-ass idea that you must hate your ex-lover is exactly how Donald Trump leads the nation. So many followers of Donald Trump who think MAGA is better than everyone else with these *hate harder* values.

People do not grasp why Trump is in charge for so many years, since June 16, 2015 Trump has universal support in USA for values of hate-promoting and hate-teaching. People who hate Trump are supporters of hate! It never was funny, and no amount of joking will undo the Rupert Murdoch society values, Elon Musk society values, Donald Trump outcomes. Too much joking away as abuse that is called "love MAGA" is exactly the celebration of inequality.

Yes. the world. Why I paid my own way to live in Chile in South America, in Algeria in Africa, Jordan in Middle East, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cyprus, and all over USA to study media ecology and how people were describing real-world places vs. Internet. And the problem people do not discuss is { advertising, marketing, fiction addiction, religion science fiction confusion, "for the LOL" bullshitting, amusement and entertainment addictions }. Humanity is fooling itself with the idea that it is fun to hate, enjoyable to wage war, and thrilling to murder and kill in organized military. It is all a massive misunderstanding. The Tower of Babel metaphor is a very real and true problem.

* "The unformulated message of an assembly of news items from every quarter of the globe is that the world today is one city. All war is civil war. All suffering is our own." - University of Toronto, Marshall McLuhan

I have given up my computing career despite my great successes... in favor of using my worst talent. Social skills, because the denial of goodness has become the worst problem of humanity. I have zero audience. It gives me constant brain damage and extreme pain to read Reddit comments day after day, but it is the crisis and peaceful way to address a very real and true crisis of thinking. I could be writing about video games or technical writing about WiFi routers for great money and still work from home... but this just pushes the world further and further away from humanism.

* "Why should there be hunger and privation in any land, in any city, at any table when man has the resources and the scientific know-how to provide all mankind with the basic necessities of life? Even deserts can be irrigated and top soil can be replaced. We cannot complain of a lack of land, for there are twenty-five million square miles of tillable land, of which we are using less than seven million. We have amazing knowledge of vitamins, nutrition, the chemistry of food, and the versatility of atoms. There is no deficit in human resources; the deficit is in human will. The well-off and the secure have too often become indifferent and oblivious to the poverty and deprivation in their midst. The poor in our countries have been shut out of our minds, and driven from the mainstream of our societies, because we have allowed them to become invisible. Just as nonviolence exposed the ugliness of racial injustice, so must the infection and sickness of poverty be exposed and healed — not only its symptoms but its basic causes. This, too, will be a fierce struggle, but **we must not be afraid to pursue the remedy no matter how formidable** the task." - December 11, 1964

No matter how much billionaires don't want us to call out the NFL Seattle Seahawks owner for the society mind programming of "health care games" that there is an army of medical doctors serving a tiny few sports stars.

Swimming in an ocean of sports-think competitive hate and competing for dehumanization of out-groups is never enjoyable or fun. The emotions people feel are all gross misunderstandings. Authentic joy and authentic fun and authentic happiness are only in recognition of Wiki and FAQ and how English language itself is formed not as laws to discard and reject human persons for their syntax and spelling errors...

* "Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. For **some strange reason** I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be — this is the **interrelated structure of reality**."

The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Malala doesn't have a lot of anti-terrorism supporters about young girls being given voices in Palestine or Egypt or North Africa or Iran (where girls are being abused systemically that people know recently from December 2025 onward protests). Malala's October 8, 2013 book has a lot of insight into mob mentality mindsets.

11 month Reddit account. Top-upvoted popular comment.

Instead of sounding alarm bells that we need cult deprogramming and the mass dehumanizing of women and girls is advancing, to get behind Malala's campaigns and support Dr. Bandy X Lee's focus on mental health education - a call to just ignore the problem. Avoiding the problem is not asserting goodness. Men need to be educated why hate of women is bad for the entire planet Earth. Clearly the clergy is teaching toxic values and remedial morality lessons are needed. Malala had excellent writings and teachings to share.

Reminder of context: This isn't just one man in USA. It is Rupert Murdoch cult fandom, Elon Musk Titter cult fandoms, Donald Trump Truth Social fandoms, etc. RFK Jr's pro-disease pro-measles, etc. Women are being systemically targeted by organized cults of men.

A STOCK source of laughter. LOL culture. Meme life. The Apple iPhone 1 venue since year 2007. When Trump got on Twitter venue July 6, 2011 at 2pm https://theOutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 is when it started! Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about high-speed media systems describes the issue in more detail, 184 pages.

* “For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. SEE_ALSO David Foster Wallace concept of "Infinite Jest", joke-jesting infinity black hole.

PEOPLE ON REDDIT WILL NOT FACE UP: What is Trump good at? is Donald Trump good at goodness? Is Trump helping MAGA people with health care? WHAT EXACTLY IS Donald Trump GOOD at except appearing on camera and generating laughter!!! Trump is playing a certain type of laughter source, a comedian character, named "Tony Clifton" - from Trump's own home town, NYC. NYC SNL comedy of "Tony Clifton".

Trump is a camera magnet. Center of attention! Trump got on McDonald's commercials with Grimace dollar menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4QNXnNftWk - Donald Trump got in Home Alone films in cinema. Donald Trump gets hot girls, hot women, and flew on a private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013 for Miss Universe Sexy Show! https://time.com/5251484/donald-trump-flight-records-moscow-trip/ - 

Being **a television influencer, a Twitter influencer, a Truth social influencer, a newspaper influencer, a socialite, popularity of pop culture** is what Donald Trump is good at! MEDIA ITSELF, creating MEDIA EVENTS, is the gift and talent of Donald J. Trump! An actor doing acting, playing POTUS Tony Clifton character for laughs! It concentrates power and wealth!

Ok, folks, **let's do the math**. "The world hates him", so Trump leads with hate and the world follows with hate. 8 billion people have adopted hate because of a leader of hate. The KKK, Ku Klux Klan is a hate organization. So, 100.000%, EVERYONE in the ENTIRE WORLD, the entire planet, is following Putin's leadership of hate using Trump as a front-man for Russia. That's what this short message on Reddit is saying...

That's the very problem. EVERY PERSON follows the leadership of Putin and Trump into hate! People are so addicted to the high-speed information system delivery of Trump content to hate-watch! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching That is the very social mechanism of Surkovian governing!

Surkov, Putin, Trump, Murdoch, Musk have CRACKED the 1954 Equation! Applied hate systems, Putin and Surkov mastered the monomyth information patterns of concentrating hate to exploit the sheep of the world! And all the sheep are following the hate-leadership pied pipers!

**The 1954 Equation**

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

The forgetting all started in year 2013 with the Internet Research Agency out of Saint Petersburg Russia invading Reddit. People stop reminding each other and started prizing conflicts of out-group. The IRA won. Surkov won.

Tribal people, one of their main kinds of sport is sort of butchering each other. It’s a full-time sport in tribal societies."

3 Month Reddit account. Putin, Cambridge Analytica topics.

Twitter-length. No off-Reddit URL. No mention of dates, years. No quotes from nonfiction books. No author names. Serves to trivialize important complex topics. To understand Trumpism, please focus on how USA society prizes these low-effort commenting media environments now. We are in a raging crisis of Trump mass dehumanization / Putin mass dehumanization and Reddit society is anti-FAQ, anti-Wiki anti-Top-10 priority and concern weekly lists. There is no "We the People" uprising, no Reddit protests / social media protest, just commenting over and over in an ocean of low-effort comments. There is no refinement of information and understanding, instead it is drowning in "engagement" to commenting. It is a gathering to be anti-common ground in concerns and comprehending. It is considered uncool to organize a movement or agenda.

Relative to the posting itself: World Sex Affairs. They are HAVING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE, he has put his penis into her vagina, and he is afraid of the knowledge of good and evil about fluids out of the vagina! I have witnessed this in my life again and again, people who can not deal with INFORMATION about bodily function in their intimate relationships. They can have intercourse sex, but are unable to recognize and openly deal with information and dialog! INTERCOURSE_DIALOG these inward ego barriers of compassion are far more a crisis than "getting laid" with people. 

I think billionaires SEX_SELLS_SEX_LEADERS have programmed so many adult men into hate of women. Rupert Murdoch, Paul Allen, NFL brain-damaging football **sports team** ultra-wealthy billionaire owners, NBA sports team owners, Elon Musk and his "breeding" tech-love agenda, Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Joe Rogan, ON AND ON the programming people "sex sells" controlling of women.

Having emotional reactions isn't nearly the concern as in how he used dialog. INTERCOURSE_DIALOG - this couple have joined bodies in intercourse sex, but the intercourse dialog is so fucked-up in the world. This is why "Daddy Issues" of so many men has wrecked the world. 

* "The extremists are afraid of books and pens. **The power of education frightens them**. They are afraid of women. The power of **the voice of women frightens them**. This is why they killed 14 innocent students in the recent attack in Quetta. And that is why they kill female teachers. That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are **afraid of change and equality that we will bring to our society**. And I remember that there was a boy in our school who was asked by a journalist why are the Taliban against education? He answered very simply by pointing to his book, he said, "a Talib doesn't know what is written inside this book." They **think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would point guns at people's heads** just for going to school." - July 12, 2013 https://www.theGuardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/12/malala-yousafzai-united-nations-education-speech-text

Reddit users should call for Reddit corporation to return Reddit to open source like it was at the start of Reddit website. There should be independent owner operators and federation backend peering and Usenet protocol peerings, a Usenet The Next Generation. And add subreddit.subredditsub.name conventions instead of one long flat list of subreddit names. SMTP is an open system, Reddit-like Usenet-like social media should be. Lemmy has far too many scaling performance problems, but it is good to have.

Remote operated drones are a far better investment for the future than piloted aircraft. The cost of fighter jets with men inside is extremely high. China and other manufacturing societies have a real chance to leapfrog way beyond what "Top Gun" promotes, and video game training has proven so much success for Ukraine and Russia.

What is **happening across all social media in the world is horrible**. Putin and Trump keep harming people over and over and over, year after year, and people keep commenting about it with original creatively written unique personalized comments. This commenting engagement is how Surkov information warfare works. Surkovian governing is about constantly keeping media consumers, media cultists, caged in their mindsets. "Inside the box" thinking. Why is Reddit and Bluesky not having an internet uprising calling for the removal of Donald Trump from office? What is happening across all the world wide web is people AVOIDING calling for Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership in mental health professionals educating and teaching the general public. The WWW being used to address EVERYONE on planet Earth about the dangers!

NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH - why are people on Reddit not alarmed enough to turn to mental health leaders and start educating everyone with quotes from nonfiction books?

* "the **public trust is also violated if the profession fails in its duty to alert the public** when a person who holds the power of life and death over us all shows signs of clear, dangerous mental impairment. We should pause if professionals are asked to remain silent when they have seen enough evidence to sound an alarm in every other situation. When it comes to dangerousness, should not the president of a democracy, as First Citizen, be subject to the same standards of practice as the rest of the citizenry?" ― Bandy X. Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. Published October 3, 2017. PROLOGUE. Page 5.](https://books.google.com/books?id=g0c4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=dangerousness+due+to+mental+disorder+can+become+apparent+without+a+full+diagnostic+interview+and+can+be+detected+from+a+distance&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

CONDITIONED_OPPOSITION messaging about future books. Media cults on Reddit want book media content. Instead of using Reddit to put an end to this Trump media content creation, people keep discussing their desires for more content about the events. This is a cult of information, history book cult. STOP MAKING HISTORY OF BADNESS, MAKE HISTORY FOR REDDIT_BLACKOUT and INTERNET_UPRISING to put an END to Trumpism and Putinism with education and teaching of nonfiction serious topics! CHANGE THE WORLD RIGHT NOW using Reddit commenting: Promote Dr. Bandy X Lee's writings. Promote Jen Senko's nonfiction film and book!

History tells us that Putin and Trump and Hitler will keep rising up because people prize hate. History tells us that history itself is a nightmare. Stop worshiping violence, Reddit cult of action violence images, "violence porno" cults. Anti-intellectual Reddit values, pro-Trump violence, pro-ICE violence, anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-Malala. 

* “History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.”
― James Joyce, Ulysses

Reddit society LOVES to worship cool and powerful phallic weapon systems and their ejections of power.

Reddit society avoids Malala. Avoids quoting and promoting Malala. Year 2013 Malala was on the world stage, **so was Trump - doing a sex show in Moscow** November 8, 2013. Guess who keeps getting repeated, quoted, mirrored, copycat on Reddit - Trump, not Malala.

* “Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.” ― Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil

* "That such **remoteness from reality and such thoughtlessness can wreak more havoc than all the evil instincts taken together** which, perhaps, are inherent in man—that was, in fact, the lesson one could learn in Jerusalem.” ― Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil

* "I've seen too much hate to want to hate myself; hate is too great a burden to bear. I've seen it on the faces of too many sheriffs of the South — I've seen hate. In the faces and even the walk of too many Klansmen of the South, **I've seen hate. Hate distorts** the personality. **Hate does something to the soul that causes one to lose his objectivity.** The man **who hates can't think straight**; the man **who hates can't reason right; the man who hates can't see right**; the man who hates can't walk right. And I know now that Jesus is right, that love is the way. And this is why John said, "God is love," so that he who hates does not know God, but he who loves at that moment has the key that opens the door to the meaning of **ultimate reality**." - July 4, 1965 Atlanta, Georgia.

People are prizing hate in reading (or watching TV & films) many science fiction stories. People seek out hate content in social media. People seek hate leaders in every possible source of media, not just Church science fiction stories, not just the Levant imported Bible storybook, but TV news networks like Fox News provide hate leadership that people seek out. We The People need to be educated on what hate does. Parents have made Donald Trump a leader of hate, a hate role model for their children since June 16, year 2015. FAITH_IN_HATE

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

CONCERNS_OF_FINNEGANS Concerns of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. The Tower of Babel concepts that come from people who jump to all kinds of conclusions on understanding and comprehension. We live in a world where people can't find Romans 11:32 in the Bible. I'm not talking about "belief" in Jesus or believing in God. I'm talking about LITERACY of jokes and memes. verse "1 John 4:20" BIBLE_LITERACY crisis. "I love Jesus" is WRONG - read "1 John 4:20" - you have never *seen Jesus*, you have never ***seen God***, you have seen LIVING HUMAN persons. And that manipulation of science fiction fandoms to concentrate power in the hands of the few and indoctrinate children into male-dominated abuse systems. The ASSUMPTIONS people have over humor, jokes, comprehension, understandings are horrific!

* Joseph Campbell has been challenged a couple times about "myths" nonfiction teachings. I've documented them on Wikipedia (I created the Errata section). Power of Myth book, year 1988:
* * "There is a ritual associated with the men’s societies in New Guinea that actually enacts the planting-society myth of death, resurrection, and cannibalistic consumption. There is a sacred field with drums going, and chants going, and then pauses. This goes on for four or five days, on and on. Rituals are boring, you know, they just wear you out, and then you break through to something else.
At last comes the great moment. There has been a celebration of real sexual orgy, the breaking of all rules. The **young boys** who are being initiated into manhood"
* * "And when the last boy is with her in full embrace, the supports are withdrawn, the logs drop, and the couple is killed. There is the union of male and female again, as they were in the beginning, before the separation took place. There is the union of begetting and death. They are both the same thing. Then the **little couple is pulled out and roasted and eaten** that very evening. The ritual is the repetition of the original act of the killing of a god followed by the coming of food from the dead savior. In the sacrifice of the Mass, you are taught that this is the body and blood of the Savior. You take it to you, and you turn inward, and there he works within you."

  * "The given citation is Paul Wirz, Die Marin-anim von Hollandisch Sud-Neu-Guinea (Hamburg: L. Friedrichsen and Company, Vol. II, pp.40-44, 1925)"
 
Now Campbell had access to a lot of young girls / women at Sarah Lawrence College in New York City. Campbell even married one of those young women, one of his students. Was he trying to clue us in to look at some of the rituals going on?

* Jean Erdman was 22 years old (born February 20, 1916) when she married Joseph Campbell in 1938 (May 5, 1938). Joseph Campbell, who was born on March 26, 1904, was 34 years old at the time of their marriage.

All out of ignoring "it's the Internet" mindset outgrowth of USA society, behaving like a monster machine that attacks and dehumanizes people like everyone is in a first person shooter video game to wreck other "players". People just accept that blocking isn't book burning. As if 1937 Germany had block buttons on Bluesky and Reddit. They had to use actual fame with paper and ink. Not pixels on a screen.

Unable to recognize the dehumanization Reddit society has normalized, "bots", machines. Cults are all too human. Nazi Germany didn't have "bots", Pol Pot in Cambodia 1970's wasn't bots. People can be dehumanizing and people have avoided NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Martin Luther King Jr's February 28, 1954 writings again and again in facing how hate it toxic no matter the reason or geography.
