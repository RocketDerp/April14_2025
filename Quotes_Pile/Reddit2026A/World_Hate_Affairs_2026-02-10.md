Reddit fandom to Trump does the same thing. 1. Hate-watch Trump constantly for notification to comment as fast as possible on meme platforms. 2. Describe Trump's behavior for social media peers. 3. Do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }. 4. Call MAGA a cult, call Fox News audience a cult... call hundreds of millions of out-group people cultists, but do not recognize the immediate Reddit cults to mocking and mockery. Media systems cultists all.

Reddit users swimming in low-effort commenting, avoiding the listed authors in the previous paragraph, can not see the attraction to Reddit commenting media people swim in.

If Donald Trump is so { stupid, moron, idiot, dumb } as so many say.. why is an entire population of nation, why is every media system churning out Trump content day and night since June 16, 2015 endlessly? Why are audiences flocking to, hanging upon, his every message and image? Reddit is a fandom to Trump's Reality TV Tony Clifton performance. Reddit fandom will use spare time and free time commenting over and over how stupid Trump is. The Reddit audience members will do anything and everything **to avoid these non-fiction** teachers and authors on the Reddit media cult { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, **University of Toronto** Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev }.
