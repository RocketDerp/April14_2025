This Reddit comment:

1. Blames Reddit community, the low-effort "kindergarten" level thinking that is prized on Reddit commenting section.

2. Calls people "child", adopting MAGA values of name-calling as the supreme communications technique and domination of women and children that Putin / Trump / Musk / Murdoch cultivate.

3. Does not in any way consider that extremely poor nations, without capitalism, had slavery to { Torah, Bible, Quran } fiction storytelling of a { Yahweh, Jesus, Allah } in the sky who watches and judges the everyday man into submission.  That the Levant science fiction trilogy spans power of every economic system for thousands of years. Fiction vs. nonfiction storytelling leadership that MAGA is driven by.

4. Does not consider Rupert Murdoch media empire as a modern day father-figure in the sky who rules over society like in The Bible and Church. "The Murdoch family’s global media empire, operating through News Corp and Fox Corporation, includes a vast portfolio of news, print, and television venues: Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, The Times (UK), The Sunday Times, The Sun (UK), The Australian, Sky News Australia, Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph (Australia), Courier-Mail, The Advertiser (Adelaide), Barron’s, MarketWatch, Realtor .com, HarperCollins Publishers, and various local community newspapers in Australia and the US." - Google Search summary 2026-01-18 afternoon USA

5. Indeed Trump is a symptom indeed! Celebration Of Ignorance. Celebration of Entertainment. Reality TV celebration by We The People. Musk Twitter celebration! Trump is a big time media star who played a "boss man" (fiction *The Apprentice* role) on TV ... that has now taken over the population of minds that vote people into the White House. [NYC Trump, analyze with NYC **NYU Professor Neil Postman's 1985 book** about a second-term POTUS](../Specific/Postman_1985_Howdy_Doody.md).

6. Nowhere does this Reddit comment message discuss gender situation and symbolism conflicts / roles around women. The history of MALE ONLY, Father Figure slavery to { Torah, Bible, Quran } fiction storytelling of a { Yahweh, Jesus, Allah }. And how this impacted { Hillary Clinton year 2016, Kamala Harris year 2024, and WIN by male Daddy Joe Biden in 2020 }. And why is woman leader Dr. Bandy X Lee ignored since her October 3, 2017 book was published about Trump and MAGA? Why do you see so many people calling Trump { crazy, insane, lunatic, madman } and not following a GenX leader - Dr. Lee? The book is in ever USA public library, why does nobody on Reddit quote Dr. Lee's writings? Because she is a woman..? Count them: how many messages a day do you see on Reddit calling Trump some variation of "crazy" or "insane" - that DO NOT [mention Dr Bandy X Lee or quote her books](../Bandy_X_Lee)? Regarding Reddit community commenting, see #1 above... on this very list you are now reading.


&nbsp;

There also seems to be a real attraction to older age at play. Old leaders being prized as statesmen.

* "Kamala Harris was born on October 20, 1964, and as of her birthday in 2025, she is 61 years old. Dr. Bandy X. Lee was born on May 27, 1970, making her approximately 55 years old as of early 2026. Therefore, Kamala Harris is roughly 5 years and 7 months older than Dr. Bandy Lee." - Google Search summary 2026-01-19 afternoon USA

* One more assertion to add to the women symbolism conflicts: **abortion, birth control**, forced birth, gender in marriages, etc. MAGA movement is generally *not* talking about changing fertility behaviors of men - except maybe to allow adult men to have sex with younger girls; to reduce consent laws from age 16 down to age 12 or age 13. Male domination of women is a huge MAGA social focus.

Consider: the male Trump vs. previous 3 named women (Harris, Clinton, Lee)... and factor of Levant God male domination (childhood indoctrination) and Rupert Murdoch male god programming of audiences (We The People) should be factored in... as very poor people all over the world are influenced by Clergy Televangelism media publishers (of fiction storytelling) like Murdoch [and Musk](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/13/elon-musk-s-ambition-repopulating-the-planet-and-destroying-the-woke-virus_6714239_4.html).

That making fun of bad people isn't funny-washing, LOL-washing and turning crimes and horror acts into a source of entertainment content isn't an actual problem. Ha ha, Donald Trump rapes children, isn't something that sunk an entire nation into hate leadership. That joke-washing and Fox News HDTV comedy-washing LOL-washing that Rupert Murdoch does isn't real harm to the society. That media site owners don't increase their power and influence by selling jokes and comedy like Fox News HDTV does to LOL-wash Trump family. I can be more redundant, yes. But no matter how many ways I rephrase it, people do not grasp or understand Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about Reddit and Fox News in year 1985.

https://old.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/1myl480/the_lolcow_industrial_complex_is_ablist_as_fuck/naemfrh/

The ENTIRE USA, the ENTIRE POPULATION is a victim of abuse by Rupert Murdoch LOL-cow milking Donald J. Trump for selling of entertainment content Fox News HDTV. I will keep trying to rephrase until my last dying breath. Mob mentality is a real thing. Mafia mentality is Trumpism Fox News. AVOIDING Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction books because everyone is mocking away at Trump on social machines day in and day out since October 3, 2017 publication... mockery in mob mentality to exploit group-thinking mob mentality is a true and real problem.

* “For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Year 1985. Nonfiction book on paper.

This comment I ran across again today, and well. The horror is that this is exactly Neil Postman's 1985 book boiled down to an audience member of Reddit. Regarding... Elon Musk (richest man in the world) to Donald Trump (most powerful man in the world). We The People are motivated by entertainment and amusement above all else. Fuck-over children, fuck-over the future, poison the Earth - as long as to Big Name Status Symbols can entertain the fandom of MAGA via Reddit high-speed commenting systems.
