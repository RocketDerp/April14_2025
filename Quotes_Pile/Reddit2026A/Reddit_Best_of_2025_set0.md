This Reddit comment:

1. Blames Reddit community, the low-effort "kindergarten" level thinking that is prized on Reddit commenting section.
2. Calls people "child", adopting MAGA values of name-calling as the supreme communications technique and domination of women and children that Putin / Trump / Musk / Murdoch cultivate.
3. Does not in any way consider that extremely poor nations, without capitalism, had slavery to { Torah, Bible, Quran } fiction storytelling of a { Yahweh, Jesus, Allah } in the sky who watches and judges the everyday man into submission.  That the Levant science fiction trilogy spans power of every economic system for thousands of years.
4. Does not consider Rupert Murdoch media empire as a modern day father-figure in the sky who rules over society like in The Bible and Church. "The Murdoch family’s global media empire, operating through News Corp and Fox Corporation, includes a vast portfolio of news, print, and television venues: Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, The Times (UK), The Sunday Times, The Sun (UK), The Australian, Sky News Australia, Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph (Australia), Courier-Mail, The Advertiser (Adelaide), Barron’s, MarketWatch, Realtor .com, HarperCollins Publishers, and various local community newspapers in Australia and the US." - Google Search summary 2026-01-18 afternoon USA
