Top-voted Twitter-length comment. This is where free time and spare time is spent. Low-effort "The Media" of Reddit, people are not asserting important details and names of players / timelines. Just living in a land of short commenting as *social engagement* to Trump Putin Kremlin White House behaviors. This is not resisting, this is play by play audience spectatorship detachment. Sports mentality, sprots-think. People don't say they want to *stop what is happening* and cite nonfiction books, instead high-speed messaging engagement is to make thro-away commenting on it like the weather today might rain for an hour at 2:00pm. Passive and non-resisting, We The People are using spare time this way. Diluting important assertions with time spent on no-citation non-educational filler non-nutritional commenting.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

* "If you look behind that pyramid, you see a desert. If you look before it, you see plants growing. The desert, the tumult in Europe, wars and wars and wars — we have pulled ourselves out of it and **created a state in the name of reason, not in the name of power**, and out of that will come the flowerings of the new life. That’s the sense of that part of the pyramid." - 1988 Power of Myth

How hard is it for Reddit to make site-famous the name of Dr. Bandy X Lee? A brave woman who stands up to Trump with education and book-writing. Not flame and burning desires of meme addicts on Reddit who are thrilled to have ignorant leaders to mock.

Yes. My experience in Algeria during the Arab Spring was still a very anti-fun, anti-joy prizing. Marriage without children is an idea that bewilders people raised by terrorist mosque and society. That humans are the origins of the Quran and origins of compassion and love... the anti-education takes over. Malala from Pakistan has been one of the few to articulate. Elif Şafak is a great educator too.

People jump from one cult to another. Here in USA, you are ridiculed and mocked if you dress out of fashion. Wealthy rulers, billionaires, advertise and market using Edward Bernays methods of manipulating factory purchased cookie-cutter seasonal trends. To listen to music from 1973 or dress like year 1973 will be mocked as stupid. Where following the latest fashion stars that Hollywood billionaires (Like Paul Allen sports owner billionaire in Seattle with investing in DreamWorks)... a lot of manufactured conformity, peer pressure.

* "When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways."

People have no concept or education on the mental health of religion, cult, governments, societies, macro level. Dr. Bandy X Lee ignored. People have faith only in cheering on weapon systems and the availability of guns. Killing brains instead of education / teaching / learning brains. Anti-Malala society values.

There is no social media uprising. People will not stop sports games, gaming, video games, low-effort commenting and actually teach mental health professionals, nonfiction books, from Dr. Bandy X Lee and others. People are engaged to cheer on the defeat / suffering of other people. Hate motivates. You see people talking far more about their favorite killing hardware, guns and other machines, than teaching Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's word.

Racing to be the top-upvoted comment (currently this linked comment is the most popular in the toxic popularity of Donald. J. Trump society January 2026).

Iran clergy. We (human race) raise people to prize hate.

Has the Middle East right-wing media bubble felt enough pain with out-group hate? How many more thousands of years of "Dictator in the Sky" Allah / Jesus / Yaweh of Torah / Quran / Bible do you need to see that fiction itself is what the Founding Fathers of the USA were addressing? Science reality vs. science fiction monomyth Bible vs. Quran vs. Torah. George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/): ... ... ...      

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut—by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?
JOSEPH CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and to human beings rather than just to their own community. **It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future**.
MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?
CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but **with the planet**. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.
MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.
CAMPBELL: That’s what the Great Seal is all about.

"On the contrary, Putin is creating a new Comintern. This is not isolationism, but rather **the maximum Putinization of the world**.

That's the Putin information war since year 2012. Endlessly exhausting.

* "But the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year (2014). In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - BBC, Adam Curtis.

There has been no world-famous social media uprising! Where can people point to weeks-long month-long messaging from American / USA social media users begging to get mental health workers to rescue MAGA and get rid of the entire self-harm anti-goodness movement? Where can people point to the month where social media users were serious and focused about Elon Musk Twitter / Fox News HDTV / Truth Social Trumpism media crisis?

When did the QAnon issue get confronted on social media where there was a massive population saying "QAnon is bullshit" or ANYTHING people can point to a month or a year where EVERYDAY USA CITIZENS ruse up again Trump using social media? An "Enough is Enough, we gave Trump a chance!" messaging? Organized, sustained?

NO KINGS has been photos of gatherings in public. But Trump LIVES BY MEDIA, by Twitter social media.

Online users should be world famous for the largest information systems even in world history. But the fandom of Trump is so addictive. This December 19, 2012 story about Trump on Twitter / Tweeting / Tweets - https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/the-30-most-outrageous-donald-trump-tweets-of-2012 Trump ROSE via Social Media, an old white man doing new tricks on smartphone. yet, social media users will not organize a protest for the digital age! Meme users can not go beyond fragmenting ideas into meme-speak meme-think. When [the time came for defragmenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defragmentation) June 16, 2015 - We The People, the World Wide Web, did not protest - people cheered on to have a meme leader, meme nation.

Meme addiction has wrecked the nation. People are all meme parroting away on DIFFERENT comment sections, different edges of message trees. Fragmenting as Trump crushes people into little tiny-short mindsets of a fragmented people.

* “In America, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and it is certainly useful to have a few when a pollster shows up. But these are opinions of a quite different order from eighteenth- or nineteenth-century opinions. It is probably more accurate to call them emotions rather than opinions, which would account for the fact that they change from week to week, as the pollsters tell us. What is happening here is that television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called *disinformation*. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information — misplaced, **irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information — information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result**. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?” — Neil Postman, [Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Year 1985.

Social media is *the new media*. Shit-posting social content has wrecked the nation. People are doing everything they can to avoid asserting and dusting off Marshall McLuhan's 1960's self-awareness lessons / teachings. Social posting on Truth Social is the role model for attitudes and mindsets. 

* Truth Social is *the new media system, anti-truth, bullshit prizing*... "The pain caused by new media and new technologies tends very much to fall into the category of 'referred pain,' such as skin trouble caused by the appendix or the heart. As with all new technologies, pain creates a special form of space, just as they also create pain. It's very much a case again of Heinrich Hertz' law: "The consequences of the images will be the images of the consequences."

People cheer it on because it is mythology driven. The IRA since March 2013 has convinced touch-device addicts that fiction storytelling is what they are watching. Detachment from reality. The clergy of media systems, all the billionaires are repeating the CA and IRA patterns into audience minds to hand over power and wealth for images and entertainment. Reddit itself is a venue for mocking and insulting billionaires. Which is not resisting, it's playing right into the hands of the Surkov students. Authentic self-awareness resisting would be doing cult deprogramming education, asserting University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan's 1960's teachings. That would be freeing minds to make active choices instead of chasing the billionaire content.

As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore **the technologies** that undo their capacities to think. What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be **no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one**. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be **drowned in a sea of irrelevance**. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture"; "This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

* "In the information age it is obviously possible to decimate populations by the dissemination of information and gimmickry. There is no question here of values. It is simple information technology being used by one community to reshape another one. It is this type of aggression that we exert on our own youngsters in what we call "education." We simply impose upon them the patterns that we find convenient to ourselves and consistent with the available technologies." - War and Peace in the Global Village. Canadian Marshall McLuhan.

* "When NPD and psychopathy combine, they form a pattern of behavior called malignant narcissism. This isn’t a diagnosis, but a term coined by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and elaborated on by personality disorder expert, Otto Kernberg, to describe people so driven by feeling special that they essentially see other people as **pawns in their game** of kill or be killed, whether metaphorically or literally. Hitler, who murdered millions, Kim Jong-un, who’s suspected of ordering his uncle’s and brother-in-law’s deaths, and **Vladimir Putin, who jokes about “liquidating journalists”** — no doubt all fall in the category of malignant narcissist (among possessing other pernicious traits, like sadism, or delight in hurting others)."

Top-voted comment on post. Extreme tiny-short Musk Twitter messaging. No resistance, just messaging to Reddit audience that this is to be accepted without resisting. No alarm, just matter of fact. No patriot call for intellectual defense.. such as repeating Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book quotes and her name...

Cheering on MAGA, fandom of Trump. We are so far past { satire, sarcasm, parody }. The pattern I am calling out is the avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee, avoidance of Peter Pomerantsev. Media addiction to COMMENTING about Trump is the concern of the nation. Creating media content. Being a super-star of media systems,.. following Trump media signals and leadership.

Information overload symptoms abound. So much junk information and falsehoods, so much fiction being created, people can't keep up with reality and comprehending important serious issues. The rural population of the USA has weakened by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News and other fiction-based news networks. The Internet Research Agency since March 2013 has exploited this educational weakness that Fox News fed since October 7, 1996.

We The People can't even do a social media uprising.

Everyone is reacting to famous people, sports games, video games, gaming, TV shows. I witness very little hard-thinking about how amusement and entertainment is being lead by a Reality TV entertainer.

But meme addicts keep commenting ABOUT every action, in REACTION to Trump. Instead of organizing an online movement against Trump, to exp ell Trump and MAGA with mental health education by Dr. Lee.

There is NO EVIDENCE people are more concerned about Trump than they are about rectangle sports game of NFL season final!

You can say you're different from the rest of Americans, but to the rest of the world, that distinction doesn't exist.

To us, your country is a **single entity on the world stage**, and it's threatening its allies. Think about **how you view other countries**. For example, Russian opposition doesn't change what Russia does, because that's their domestic politics. The same thing applies to the US too, except you had the power to choose your president, and you may still have it.

So instead of coming here nonstop to apologise on behalf of your country for your constant need for sympathy, focus on actually changing something while you still can."

I personally think it would be GOOD to reform the society USING SOCIAL MEDIA. But people are so attracted to toxic. Donald Trump provides hate leadership and EVERYONE (not just MAGA, not just conservatives, not just Republican) follows the hate signaling.

Every problem Trump goes out and solves, like force to take over Greenland, creates interesting and engaging conversation for Reddit users. This is how people spend their available spare time, free time, in service to the billionaires. There isn't a call for intellectual uprising, active teaching, active education of why what happening is bad. There is no calls for society-wide moral teachings about how taking other people's freedom away is bad. Instead, people have discussion of technical details.

The technical details you do not see discussed on Reddit commenting that applies to every posting: { addiction to media, Marshall McLuhan teachings, Neil Postman teachings, and Trump and Putin's technique through the teachings by Peter Pomerantsev, Dr. Bandy X Leep, etc }

The attraction to *following Trumps* chess moves far exceeds the Reddit information consumer's desire to remove the chess game Trump is playing entirely.

This is why I put so much blame on everyday social media users not doing an uprising and sustaining it. We The People have to have a legendary uprising to show the world that WE, as everyday people, are not beholden to one billionaire or another. People who hate Trump do not stand up to the very system that allows Trump to take power. People have most of all promoted hate of ICE, hate of MAGA, which is *following Trump's leadership*. The world can see the difference over the long term. There is no quoting of MLK Jr, American MLK Jr, against billionaires and hate. 

Instead, over the long run, we look like we are all waiting around fir Iron Man or Super Man or some other comic and film superstar hero. We The People did not start being too preachy. that's our fear, the confrontation of egoism by dusting off Bible verse "1 John 3:17" and preaching against billionaires. It isn't that difficult, but getting people to face their entertainment addictions (Neil Postman 1985 book) is extremely difficult. Trump is a constant source of entertainment. It i a sick society that finds hate to be entertaining. that finds ICE raids to be entertaining. Morality needs to be taught, asserted, adult education. I created "Remedial Morality" lessons on Reddit April 10, 2025 https://Old.Reddit.com/r/RemedialMorality

Alas, people would rather spend free time and spare time on commenting instead of spending that same time on serious topics. I'm sickened, extremely sick, by it all. It just never ends for over a decade. The rest of the world is making it louder and louder that the USA will not get back the respect that i now lost.

It was not difficult for social media users to keep repeating: "We want to be more like Canada and less like Russia". It isn't that hard to come up with a simple statement of what future is desired. But the future people desire is GTA6 game release and more Trump images from Truth Social to mock and insult.

George Lucas himself, summer of 1985, at the fucking PEAK of his influence and popularity with the 1977 Star Wars films... Stuck his neck out and arranged Bill Moyers, a former employee of the White House... and learned and talented person to **be too preachy**. Three white men, Moyers, Campbell, Lucas - milked the last 3 years of life out of Joseph Campbell at age 81, age 82, age 83 for what was wrong with USA. The Great Seal of the Untied States of America. I created the fucking website from Lucas filming: www.GreatSealUSA.com

You will almost never find Star Wars fans who read that 293 page book and cite it. You see Star Wars memes on Reddit constantly, a living audience, but they are entirely avoidant of the Power of Myth 1988 book. And in that book, Donald Trump is spelled out.

You can not let film entertainment, TV entertainment, exceed the mind. Mockery ad addiction to fiction takes over. that's the story of Comparative Mythology!! that is the meaning of "Wake" in Star Wars Day 1939 "Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce. Being *woke* to fiction bamboozle. 

That is why the founding fathers, free masons, created the Great Seal of the United States of America teaching tool. With the eagle and pyramid. Even with Star Wars, Bill Moyers, George Lucas - it was not made "entertaining enough" for people to learn from since year 1988. Then Surkov students came along in March 2013 and our minds all sold out to fiction Russian bullshit storytelling. Surkov won.

As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any **opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable**. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year (2014). In typical fashion, as the war began, Surkov published a short story about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create **a constant state of destabilized perception**, in order to manage and control." - BBC, Adam Curtis.

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

The PLIRIBUS fandom on Reddit was monstrous the 2 months (November 2025 onward) I spent interacting with people. I documented discussion after discussion of the moderators banning people for the most superficial domination reasons. People celebrating ignorance and mocking intelligent discourse over and over in the name of TV show fandom. These are not children. It is social media training ground to teach and cultivate hate and anti-forgiveness anti-compassion. "No compassion. No empathy. Is this what we are?" **Osmosis isn't working**, except for hate. Street gangs of Fox News HDTV fandoms, fiction addicts to Fox News HDTV and Newsmax and /r/conservative street gang members. Bible street gang members of toxic clergy.

Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human."      
You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis. We'll it's not working by osmosis!

The whole nation needs to be looking and following Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership. A woman who has stuck her neck out. Her October 3, 2017 book should be asserted and quoted. The cult behaviors to avoid nonfiction book learning are sickening, it is a very sick society. 

*  "As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.     
Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”    
Those who embrace Trump’s reality, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”    
That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point."

AFTER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS, Reddit **snark addict claims they are going sober** to mocking and joking and joke-washing Trump. "This isn't a snarky talking point anymore." - my fucking god man, the recency bias and denial. None of these Reddit users can remember year 2017. A book published by Dr. Bandy X Lee way back in October 3, 2017 has tons of public quotes. Nearly 150 quote from the **year 2017 book**: https://www.goodReads.com/author/quotes/16953723.Bandy_X_Lee

8 month Reddit account. "hysterical", hilarious, funny to Reddit audiences. Every situation MAGA and Putin creates is joke-washed by Reddit meme society. **Top-voted comment (again, 8 month account)**. Twitter-think USA mindsets. All entertainment. Eating right out of Surkov student hands. Trump is an acting, he is an actor, Reddit is the audience fandom.

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."

Do people think in 2026 under Trump, that Reddit is even ALLOWED to admit this in January 2026? Under the Trump White House? In year 2018, the intelligence agencies / Pentagon were still somewhat independent of Trump. But in 2025 and 2026, Project 2025 has taken all this into account.

* “We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to **cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do**. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to **exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition**? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 12 "Revelations", page 235, year 2019

Such ignorance. No off-Reddit URL. Putin and Trump have been **winning** since their November 2012 plan. People will not admit the most well known facts. Trump was a professional actor, TV star, "The Apprentice". He is acting, and the gullible audience of USA has been eating it up FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS! People are so mind-blown by President Tony Clifton style acting that they think this just started a month or two ago. People don't even remember Trump's first term in office back at the start of year 2017 before the pandemic!

Putin is the "Daddy" that has exploited Reddit audiences. Cloud computing Sky Daddy in the meme clouds. Fiction addictions run USA. The issue isn't one man, the issue is why educated Reddit end-users with free time and spare time to comment day in and day out FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS... are so fucking avoidant of the nonfiction section of the public library? Why are their minds blown into chuckle, LOL, states constantly? Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency (IRA) are the only answers that make sense why the massive behavior changes to mock nonfiction learning since year 2014.

There is a whole chapter on "Daddy" issues.

"It is a mistake to believe that Putin wants to lower a new Iron Curtain, build a new Berlin Wall and pursue a policy of isolationism," Morozov wrote in Colta.ru. "On the contrary, Putin is creating a new Comintern. This is not isolationism, but rather **the maximum Putinization of the world**. The Comintern was a complex system that worked with ideologically sympathetic intellectuals and politicians. What we are seeing now is not an attempt to restore the past, but the creation of an entirely new hegemony."

Reddit society alone has made the USA look ignorant. Dumb worship center. Like Homer Simpson working for Mr. Burns. People who did not rise up on Reddit and protest and make Dr. Bandy X Lee a household name. Reddit did not make Jen Senko a household name. You do not need an ELECTION DAY to rise up and make Jen Senko's nonfiction film about Fox News famous. That can be done on ANY DAY on Reddit. But people are so pro-ignorance an anti-FAQ anti-Wiki.  ANYTHING to not get the same page of goodness and progress. A population of dumb-prizing shit-lording shit-seeking Trump-mocking tech addicts. 

People who fare so little about their own father that they let Rupert Murdoch and Rush Limbaugh mind-fuck them. Young men on Reddit are so fucking afraid of women leaders like Jen Senko that they won't even address their own father's addictions. Anti-compassion. Elon Musk ant-empathy Reddit mob mentality. Why is Jen Senko ignored on Reddit? Why isn't she the magic role model to hold up and teach how to rescue your own father from Fox News? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad

2. Putin Internet Research Agency ate faces on Reddit. LOL LOL, ha ha

It is sickening and abusive in USA. People prize hate, tech hate, encourage hate. Anti-Malala anti-MLK Jr. Anti-goodness. Small town farmers had predatory Elon Musk mind-fucking them, predator Facebook billionaires mind-fucking them, predatory New York City golf course owners mind-fucking rural farmers in Indiana. All the poor immigrants from Mexico got mind-fucked by Rupert Murdoch and Putin and people think it is funny to joke "Leopards ate faces, Rupert Murdoch ate a Cuban poor family face!!' - worshiping the god damn Murdoch family. It's so fucking sickening what I see on /r/LeopardsAteFaces joke comedy hall. A god damn anti-compassion anti-Malala terrorist training camp for young me to cheer on horrors of billionaires mind-fucking uneducated women and children.

Small town people depend on compassion and intelligent rural people to stand up and defend. Like Jen Senko stands up and rescued her father from right-wing radio and Fox News. But Reddit is a pro-Russia pro-Putin training ground cheering on the Putin "leopards" like Trump to *eat faces harder*. So fucking mentally sick mob mentality.

You voted for your drug addiction, you voted for your booze, ha ha ha. Leopards ate faces. Anti-compassion bullshit. Rupert Murdoch has made entertainment Fox News a mechanism of abuse. A way to dehumanize with Fox News jokes and memes. And Reddit addicts do the same god-dam thing Rupert Murdoch does. Promote ignorance and anti-understanding.

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”

This type of message is intend to wash away MLK Jr and Malala's prize. You see this attitude constantly promoted on Reddit since year 2013. That the **brand of information** matters most of all. Not truth, not accuracy, not fact-checking, but the BRAND LOYALTY. So this Reddit comment is mind-fucking the audience since a source of information is imperfect, throw out the baby with the bathwater. Any imperfect, ban it entirely. 

You see the same mind-fucking messages on Reddit about New York Times or Washington Post, The Atlantic, or Newsweek. People who want to ban, book burn, the ENTIRE venue / brand of news. Instead of actually cherry-pick accurate and good information from sources. They want you to believe there is only one perfect source of information and to abandon and shut down everything ever published or created. 

Rick Roderick's 1993 lectures talk about information overload and complexity. And this is what billionaires are exploiting. Go to ChatGPT for all your needs, don't go to individual Newsweek sources and fact-check individual stories. Loyalty to a brand-name source.

We just keep ignoring media addiction to science fiction stories as a problem we keep carrying into the future. Fiction outsells nonfiction.

God is made-up. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" spells this out in the Levant thousands of years ago. Further, Trump is an actor, Reality TV is scripted. tiny-short Reddit commenting, twitter-think, can't study nonfiction of Surkov in Russia and recognize that **antics politics** is very popular on Reddit. Images of Trump to insult. A Reddit cult of mocking and insulting the President Tony Clifton outrageous performance acting. Another Reddit user who has "eaten the Onion" and does not recognize Trump is acting to a Kremlin screenplay of unusual an bizarre behaviors.

It gets Reddit audiences to line up every time Trump does something that is shocking. That is how Surkov information warfare, Surkov governing works! No defense has been found, as Reddit users "eat the shit", "eat the onion" every time and do not turn to serious nonfiction books and articles. 

If We The People read this from September 9, 2014 - which is more than 10 years ago, more than a decade - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare.

Right out of Russia's expanding "War Against Reality" that went global in year 2012 / year 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare.

That's why I named this page "hate affairs". People do not understand the hate-motivation USA meme consumers have. The prizing of hate. The following of Trump's hate leadership. Canada is one of the strongest symbols; there is zero good reason to hate...except addition to Trump fantasy storytelling. 

People are not facing up to what the Internet Research Agency and Cambridge Analytica dug into regarding human relationships. Anti-goodness, pro-disease. People won't take this August 24, 2018 story seriously: https://www.BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 yet the pro-disease RFK Jr and Trump paring are right there in year 2025... look at the timeline of Twitter year 2014 onward. 

How more clear of a symbol can you be than Canada? Trump is a hate leader and Reddit audience gives the "go" symbol to hate every time it insult and mocks back at Trump in a feedback loop. Turning to nonfiction of MLK Jr or Dr. Bandy X. Lee is evidence people want to stop the growth and expansion of Trump's hate-based power. Alas, you don't see it. People won't stand up for their neighbors within the USA and won't stand up for Canada. Marshall McLuhan is one of the best teachers to take on the Fox News HDTV audience cult, but again - Reddit audience won't face their own hate addiction to Trump's leadership of hate.
