Top-voted Twitter-length comment. This is where free time and spare time is spent. Low-effort "The Media" of Reddit, people are not asserting important details and names of players / timelines. Just living in a land of short commenting as *social engagement* to Trump Putin Kremlin White House behaviors. This is not resisting, this is play by play audience spectatorship detachment. Sports mentality, sprots-think. People don't say they want to *stop what is happening* and cite nonfiction books, instead high-speed messaging engagement is to make thro-away commenting on it like the weather today might rain for an hour at 2:00pm. Passive and non-resisting, We The People are using spare time this way. Diluting important assertions with time spent on no-citation non-educational filler non-nutritional commenting.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Year 635 onward, "Old World Order" as defined by the Great Seal of the United States of America. Violence, hate. Extreme tiny-short Reddit meme-think messages, Twitter-thinking Tweet-length Musk values. Avoiding repeating and asserting: { Jen Senko, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Dr. Bandy X Lee, Peter Pomerantsev }. Avoiding nonfiction learning.

* "If you look behind that pyramid, you see a desert. If you look before it, you see plants growing. The desert, the tumult in Europe, wars and wars and wars — we have pulled ourselves out of it and **created a state in the name of reason, not in the name of power**, and out of that will come the flowerings of the new life. That’s the sense of that part of the pyramid." - 1988 Power of Myth

How hard is it for Reddit to make site-famous the name of Dr. Bandy X Lee? A brave woman who stands up to Trump with education and book-writing. Not flame and burning desires of meme addicts on Reddit who are thrilled to have ignorant leaders to mock.

Donald Trump is an addict to entertainment just like the rest of USA society. Trump should be rescued from Putin's fiction storytelling. The addicts to saying Donald Trump { toddler, dumb, idiot, baby, stupid, moron, not smart } over and over in a loop every day on Reddit commenting sections.

Women have been turned into factories of children making. Programmed by men to obey.

Yes. My experience in Algeria during the Arab Spring was still a very anti-fun, anti-joy prizing. Marriage without children is an idea that bewilders people raised by terrorist mosque and society. That humans are the origins of the Quran and origins of compassion and love... the anti-education takes over. Malala from Pakistan has been one of the few to articulate. Elif Şafak is a great educator too.

People jump from one cult to another. Here in USA, you are ridiculed and mocked if you dress out of fashion. Wealthy rulers, billionaires, advertise and market using Edward Bernays methods of manipulating factory purchased cookie-cutter seasonal trends. To listen to music from 1973 or dress like year 1973 will be mocked as stupid. Where following the latest fashion stars that Hollywood billionaires (Like Paul Allen sports owner billionaire in Seattle with investing in DreamWorks)... a lot of manufactured conformity, peer pressure.

* "When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways."
