Top-voted Twitter-length comment. This is where free time and spare time is spent. Low-effort "The Media" of Reddit, people are not asserting important details and names of players / timelines. Just living in a land of short commenting as *social engagement* to Trump Putin Kremlin White House behaviors. This is not resisting, this is play by play audience spectatorship detachment. Sports mentality, sprots-think. People don't say they want to *stop what is happening* and cite nonfiction books, instead high-speed messaging engagement is to make thro-away commenting on it like the weather today might rain for an hour at 2:00pm. Passive and non-resisting, We The People are using spare time this way. Diluting important assertions with time spent on no-citation non-educational filler non-nutritional commenting.

Self-harm. But LOL LOL Reddit community washes it all away with brain resets due to comedy venue commenting.

yes. The faith in { amusement, entertainment, sports games, video games, mockery, hate, feedback loops, gaming, gamers }. We could be building a REAL "Ready Player One" society in Columbus Ohio and other inexpensive areas, but instead we get Bluesky and Reddit with zero self-awareness. People *settle for* shit relationships with sugar-daddy Trickle Down junk images and content from the rich and famous billionaires. Musk, Murdoch, Trump instead of some cool intelligent guy in the Read Player One story.

The faith that it is only a tiny amount of terrorists in Palestine or Pakistan. Makes the whole nation a terrorist nation when people don't actually educate out of terrorists Mosque / terrorists Newsmax / terrorist subreddits / terrorist Facebook training camp / terrorist Fox News HDTV programming of audience minds. 

USA society will not face up that Quran, Bible, Torah, Book of Mormon, L Ron Hubbard are ALL science fiction storytelling. And Truth Social is a fiction-based media venue, as is Reddit a fiction-based media venue. Fiction addiction runs the USA society now. Science thinking and nonfiction abandoned.
