DENIAL_ABOUNDS. Tiny-short shit-commenting on Reddit. Shit-posting nation. People who adore Twitter-length Tweet-thinking mindsets of shit-commenting. The problem is We The People are attracted to this very kind of Twitter commenting. July 6, 2011 when Trump jumped on the shit-commenting https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 at 140 characters and made it an entire way of running a nation. The problem is the audience, the problem is Reddit. Reddit is a fandom of shit-posting shit-leadership Trumpism. Anti-intellectual Reddit community.

"has one toddler with nukes (Putin)" - Trump is not a toddler. But this Reddit comment is baby-talk. Trump is nearly 80 years old, is not a toddler. Donald Trump is a media star, an experienced media practitioner. Trump knows that shit-posting and shit-commenting is what wins debates. Trump knows that antics and behaving wild and crazy gets him instant front-page coverage on Reddit. Reddit fandom to shit can not resist Trump as a shit-lord. People on Reddit CHOOSE to watch Trump every hour of every day to make their shit-comments about how dumb and stupid Trump is. The audience on Reddit is the dumb-shits. **TRUMP IS NOT A TODDLER, ADULTS IN USA GET ADULT EDUCATION FROM SHIT SOURCES**.

* "In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when **cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act**, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.
In America, Orwell’s prophecies are of small relevance, but Huxley’s are well under way toward being realized. For America is engaged in the world’s most ambitious experiment to accommodate itself to the **technological distractions made possible by the electric plug**. This is an experiment that began slowly and modestly in the mid-nineteenth century and has now, in the latter half of the twentieth, reached a perverse maturity in America’s consuming love-affair with television. As nowhere else in the world, Americans have moved far and fast in bringing to a close the age of the slow-moving printed word, and have granted to television sovereignty over all of their institutions. By ushering in the Age of Television, America has given the world the clearest available glimpse of the Huxleyan future." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. year 1985.

DENIAL_ABOUNDS "She wasn’t confident enough to engage in anything but name-calling in a hearing. And so no, I don’t have confidence in her.”

Name-calling wins ANY debate on ANY topic. Manipulating people using the power of the White House media coverage wins ANY TOPIC no matter how complicated, by drowning out nonfiction signal with name-calling shit-talking shit-posting shit-commenting. Russia won against NATO using this technique on Reddit since March 2013! USA is in mental ruins because Russia discovered that name-calling wins ANY AND EVERY debate. Shit-commenting wins! Surkov won since March of year 2013.

* "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using **crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion."** "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that **there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds**, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just **driving discussion away** completely," she adds. "Those **kinds of tactics are meant to stop democratic debate**, and they work." - **year 2014** https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-kremlins-troll-army/375932/

Reddit shit-posting and shit-commenting sold out the USA to shit values. People on Reddit prize high-speed information systems notifications and low-quality low-effort commenting above all else. Enshitification of a nation via Reddit values. Surkov won since 2013. The morality of a Reddit consumer is: spread shit as far and as wide as possible, the more shit-posting shit there is, the harder the Reddit upvote button is pressed. Anti-intellectual cultists. Followers of MAGA values who are so much denial of exactly the shit that MAGA values: anti-intellectualism and hate. Tech addicts of Reddit, gaming tech lovers, can not see all the technology billionaires lined up and how Trump has out-smarted Reddit. Reddit is a shit-commenting feedback loop of shit-lord worshipers. Trumpism USA.

* “Technopoly is to say that its information immune system is inoperable. Technopoly is a **form of cultural AIDS, which I here use as an acronym for Anti-Information Deficiency Syndrome.** This is why it is possible to say almost anything without contradiction provided you begin your utterance with the words “A study has shown …” or “Scientists now tell us that …” More important, it is why in a Technopoly there can be no transcendent **sense of purpose or meaning, no cultural coherence**. Information is dangerous when it has no place to go, when there is no theory to which it applies, no pattern in which it fits, when there is no higher purpose that it serves. Alfred North Whitehead called such information “inert,” but that metaphor is too passive. **Information without regulation can be lethal**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992

Why is Reddit commenting community not quoting and promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee every hour of every day? ANSWER: Reddit is a cult venue for people who DESIRE Trump for the easy low-effort jokes and mockery.

Downplaying the threat. SUPER_HYPER_NORMAL  Extreme tiny-short messaging on Reddit, Twitter-think Tweet-length mindsets, to downplay and ignore all that has been happening since February 20, 2014 with Putin, Russia and information warfare on Reddit since March 2013. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid how **DANGEROUS** Trump leadership is. Shit-commenting Reddit community is commenting away all nonfiction serious learning for adults in favor of downplaying (minimizing / trivializing) and normalizing Trump's every play against We The People and technological threat to humanity that this type of organized machine logic can be.

* “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that [everything was possible and that nothing was true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Is_True_and_Everything_Is_Possible). ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”
― Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism, 1951
