DENIAL_ABOUNDS. Tiny-short shit-commenting on Reddit. Shit-posting nation. People who adore Twitter-length Tweet-thinking mindsets of shit-commenting. The problem is We The People are attracted to this very kind of Twitter commenting. July 6, 2011 when Trump jumped on the shit-commenting https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 at 140 characters and made it an entire way of running a nation. The problem is the audience, the problem is Reddit. Reddit is a fandom of shit-posting shit-leadership Trumpism. Anti-intellectual Reddit community.

"has one toddler with nukes (Putin)" - Trump is not a toddler. But this Reddit comment is baby-talk. Trump is nearly 80 years old, is not a toddler. Donald Trump is a media star, an experienced media practitioner. Trump knows that shit-posting and shit-commenting is what wins debates. Trump knows that antics and behaving wild and crazy gets him instant front-page coverage on Reddit. Reddit fandom to shit can not resist Trump as a shit-lord. People on Reddit CHOOSE to watch Trump every hour of every day to make their shit-comments about how dumb and stupid Trump is. The audience on Reddit is the dumb-shits. **TRUMP IS NOT A TODDLER, ADULTS IN USA GET ADULT EDUCATION FROM SHIT SOURCES**.

* "In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when **cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act**, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.
In America, Orwell’s prophecies are of small relevance, but Huxley’s are well under way toward being realized. For America is engaged in the world’s most ambitious experiment to accommodate itself to the **technological distractions made possible by the electric plug**. This is an experiment that began slowly and modestly in the mid-nineteenth century and has now, in the latter half of the twentieth, reached a perverse maturity in America’s consuming love-affair with television. As nowhere else in the world, Americans have moved far and fast in bringing to a close the age of the slow-moving printed word, and have granted to television sovereignty over all of their institutions. By ushering in the Age of Television, America has given the world the clearest available glimpse of the Huxleyan future." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. year 1985.

Name-calling wins ANY debate on ANY topic. Manipulating people using the power of the White House media coverage wins ANY TOPIC no matter how complicated, by drowning out nonfiction signal with name-calling shit-talking shit-posting shit-commenting. Russia won against NATO using this technique on Reddit since March 2013! USA is in mental ruins because Russia discovered that name-calling wins ANY AND EVERY debate. Shit-commenting wins! Surkov won since March of year 2013.

Reddit shit-posting and shit-commenting sold out the USA to shit values. People on Reddit prize high-speed information systems notifications and low-quality low-effort commenting above all else. Enshitification of a nation via Reddit values. Surkov won since 2013. The morality of a Reddit consumer is: spread shit as far and as wide as possible, the more shit-posting shit there is, the harder the Reddit upvote button is pressed. Anti-intellectual cultists. Followers of MAGA values who are so much denial of exactly the shit that MAGA values: anti-intellectualism and hate. Tech addicts of Reddit, gaming tech lovers, can not see all the technology billionaires lined up and how Trump has out-smarted Reddit. Reddit is a shit-commenting feedback loop of shit-lord worshipers. Trumpism USA.

* “Technopoly is to say that its information immune system is inoperable. Technopoly is a **form of cultural AIDS, which I here use as an acronym for Anti-Information Deficiency Syndrome.** This is why it is possible to say almost anything without contradiction provided you begin your utterance with the words “A study has shown …” or “Scientists now tell us that …” More important, it is why in a Technopoly there can be no transcendent **sense of purpose or meaning, no cultural coherence**. Information is dangerous when it has no place to go, when there is no theory to which it applies, no pattern in which it fits, when there is no higher purpose that it serves. Alfred North Whitehead called such information “inert,” but that metaphor is too passive. **Information without regulation can be lethal**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992

Why is Reddit commenting community not quoting and promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee every hour of every day? ANSWER: Reddit is a cult venue for people who DESIRE Trump for the easy low-effort jokes and mockery.

Downplaying the threat. SUPER_HYPER_NORMAL  Extreme tiny-short messaging on Reddit, Twitter-think Tweet-length mindsets, to downplay and ignore all that has been happening since February 20, 2014 with Putin, Russia and information warfare on Reddit since March 2013. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid how **DANGEROUS** Trump leadership is. Shit-commenting Reddit community is commenting away all nonfiction serious learning for adults in favor of downplaying (minimizing / trivializing) and normalizing Trump's every play against We The People and technological threat to humanity that this type of organized machine logic can be.

* “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that [everything was possible and that nothing was true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Is_True_and_Everything_Is_Possible). ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”

Blocking people on Reddit is intimidation via billionaire media systems. Blocking on Bluesky. Casual dehumanization. **Step out of line, self-censorship**. People constantly afraid of triggering a block, walking on eggshells, because the USA in total (not just Republicans, not just MAGA, not just Fox News and Newsmax HDTV fandoms) is in a hate-harder contest. A race to the bottom of who can hate and dehumanize harder and harder.

Billionaires that have directly planned and organized "Conservative International" in December 2013 right before the February 20, 2014 invasion of Ukraine.

This is how the **cult of Trump images** and Trump videos behaves on Reddit. TRUMP_FANDOM Again and again... Trump video appears on Reddit, right to the top of /r/All front page. Free time and spare time declaring that MAGA is cult with statements like: "How can conservatives be so convinced the government is hiding aliens and shit but not see through like the most obvious staging of an assassination attempt ever."

So, Joe Biden, who was POTUS in July 13, 2024 *staged an assassination*, and had half a year to investigate it.. and did not leak any evidence of it.  Reddit addicts to hyper-reality. ANTI_REALITY

* Duke University, Professor Rick Roderick, year 1993: "that sort of sickly sense that you are twisting above… sort of, abysmally too much of something. This seems to me a fine, sort of, mood characterisation for the postmodern trajectory. A sense of vertigo before all this information. Well if theses like the ones that I just described that Baudrillard holds are true… But of course the word “true” will no longer apply, because **we will be in a setting in which you won’t want the true**, you will want the truer than true. You won’t even… **The false won’t even be a good enough lie for you, you’ll want the lie better than a lie. I mean, the truer than true explanation. You won’t just want Oliver Stone‘s film about JFK. You’ll want the film about how Oliver Stone himself participated in the plot to cover up the real assassin**s by making the film JFK. They want the truth about the truth about the truth and all the way down, interminably. Vertigo. That’s the sense you get looking down that chain of bizarre stories." - Texan Rick Roderick. https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

"How can conservatives be so convinced the government is hiding aliens and shit but not see through like the most obvious staging of an assassination attempt ever." Conservative vs. Liberal brain-rot thinking systems. The real concern should be fiction vs. nonfiction. Trump is a very very popular fiction storyteller, Trump is a great Tony Clifton performance for Reddit audiences who eat it up EVERY HOUR of every day. Alas, this July 13, 2024 shooting was a real bullet that hit a real human being and the skill required to shoot a *real bullet* and miss the brain of Donald Trump intentionally... There are tens of thousands documented examples with evidence of Trump being a fiction storytelling. And Reddit itself is a cult of Trump's engaging content fiction and even photograph cult of Trump.

"is hiding aliens" - which government? People on Reddit are so fixated on Trump and MAGA and USA - do you think aliens from outer space only visit North America, and never visit Africa, Australia, Russia, China - and every government in the world is covering it up? No, what is happening here is addiction to fiction storytelling. **It is DOCUMENTED AND PROVABLE** that people read Mohammad's Quran story and BELIEVE that Allah is in out-space and that there was Adam and Eve on Eden. **IT IS DEMONSTRABLE** that people read The Bible science fiction story and believe God is in outer space sending messages to a burning bush for Moses! it is PROVABLE that people find compelling outer-space alien stories and COMPULSIVELY engage the storybook! There is EVIDENCE that "Clergy" manipulates science fiction audiences to avoid Bible verse "1 John 4:20" realization that God *is not seen*. And real human beings *are seen*.
