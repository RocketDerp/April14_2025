DENIAL_ABOUNDS. Tiny-short shit-commenting on Reddit. Shit-posting nation. People who adore Twitter-length Tweet-thinking mindsets of shit-commenting. The problem is We The People are attracted to this very kind of Twitter commenting. July 6, 2011 when Trump jumped on the shit-commenting https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 at 140 characters and made it an entire way of running a nation. The problem is the audience, the problem is Reddit. Reddit is a fandom of shit-posting shit-leadership Trumpism. Anti-intellectual Reddit community.

"has one toddler with nukes (Putin)" - Trump is not a toddler. But this Reddit comment is baby-talk. Trump is nearly 80 years old, is not a toddler. Donald Trump is a media star, an experienced media practitioner. Trump knows that shit-posting and shit-commenting is what wins debates. Trump knows that antics and behaving wild and crazy gets him instant front-page coverage on Reddit. Reddit fandom to shit can not resist Trump as a shit-lord. People on Reddit CHOOSE to watch Trump every hour of every day to make their shit-comments about how dumb and stupid Trump is. The audience on Reddit is the dumb-shits. **TRUMP IS NOT A TODDLER, ADULTS IN USA GET ADULT EDUCATION FROM SHIT SOURCES**.

* "In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours. There is no need for wardens or gates or Ministries of Truth. When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when **cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience and their public business a vaudeville act**, then a nation finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.
In America, Orwell’s prophecies are of small relevance, but Huxley’s are well under way toward being realized. For America is engaged in the world’s most ambitious experiment to accommodate itself to the **technological distractions made possible by the electric plug**. This is an experiment that began slowly and modestly in the mid-nineteenth century and has now, in the latter half of the twentieth, reached a perverse maturity in America’s consuming love-affair with television. As nowhere else in the world, Americans have moved far and fast in bringing to a close the age of the slow-moving printed word, and have granted to television sovereignty over all of their institutions. By ushering in the Age of Television, America has given the world the clearest available glimpse of the Huxleyan future." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. year 1985.

Name-calling wins ANY debate on ANY topic. Manipulating people using the power of the White House media coverage wins ANY TOPIC no matter how complicated, by drowning out nonfiction signal with name-calling shit-talking shit-posting shit-commenting.

Reddit shit-posting and shit-commenting sold out the USA to shit values. People on Reddit prize high-speed information systems notifications and low-quality low-effort commenting above all else. Enshitification of a nation via Reddit values. Surkov won since 2013. The morality of a Reddit consumer is: spread shit as far and as wide as possible, the more shit-posting shit there is, the harder the Reddit upvote button is pressed. Anti-intellectual cultists. Followers of MAGA values who are so much denial of exactly the shit that MAGA values: anti-intellectualism and hate. Tech addicts of Reddit, gaming tech lovers, can not see all the technology billionaires lined up and how Trump has out-smarted Reddit. Reddit is a shit-commenting feedback loop of shit-lord worshipers. Trumpism USA.

* “Technopoly is to say that its information immune system is inoperable. Technopoly is a **form of cultural AIDS, which I here use as an acronym for Anti-Information Deficiency Syndrome.** This is why it is possible to say almost anything without contradiction provided you begin your utterance with the words “A study has shown …” or “Scientists now tell us that …” More important, it is why in a Technopoly there can be no transcendent **sense of purpose or meaning, no cultural coherence**. Information is dangerous when it has no place to go, when there is no theory to which it applies, no pattern in which it fits, when there is no higher purpose that it serves. Alfred North Whitehead called such information “inert,” but that metaphor is too passive. **Information without regulation can be lethal**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology.

Downplaying the threat. SUPER_HYPER_NORMAL  Extreme tiny-short messaging on Reddit, Twitter-think Tweet-length mindsets, to downplay and ignore all that has been happening since February 20, 2014 with Putin, Russia and information warfare on Reddit since March 2013. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid how **DANGEROUS** Trump leadership is. Shit-commenting Reddit community is commenting away all nonfiction serious learning for adults in favor of downplaying (minimizing / trivializing) and normalizing Trump's every play against We The People and technological threat to humanity that this type of organized machine logic can be.

Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”

This is how the **cult of Trump images** and Trump videos behaves on Reddit. TRUMP_FANDOM Again and again... Trump video appears on Reddit, right to the top of /r/All front page. Free time and spare time declaring that MAGA is cult with statements like: "How can conservatives be so convinced the government is hiding aliens and shit but not see through like the most obvious staging of an assassination attempt ever."

So, Joe Biden, who was POTUS in July 13, 2024 *staged an assassination*, and had half a year to investigate it.. and did not leak any evidence of it.  Reddit addicts to hyper-reality. ANTI_REALITY

* Duke University, Professor Rick Roderick, year 1993: "that sort of sickly sense that you are twisting above… sort of, abysmally too much of something. This seems to me a fine, sort of, mood characterisation for the postmodern trajectory. A sense of vertigo before all this information. Well if theses like the ones that I just described that Baudrillard holds are true… But of course the word “true” will no longer apply, because **we will be in a setting in which you won’t want the true**, you will want the truer than true. You won’t even… **The false won’t even be a good enough lie for you, you’ll want the lie better than a lie. I mean, the truer than true explanation. You won’t just want Oliver Stone‘s film about JFK. You’ll want the film about how Oliver Stone himself participated in the plot to cover up the real assassin**s by making the film JFK. They want the truth about the truth about the truth and all the way down, interminably. Vertigo. That’s the sense you get looking down that chain of bizarre stories." - Texan Rick Roderick. https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

"How can conservatives be so convinced the government is hiding aliens and shit but not see through like the most obvious staging of an assassination attempt ever." Conservative vs. Liberal brain-rot thinking systems. The real concern should be fiction vs. nonfiction. Trump is a very very popular fiction storyteller, Trump is a great Tony Clifton performance for Reddit audiences who eat it up EVERY HOUR of every day. Alas, this July 13, 2024 shooting was a real bullet that hit a real human being and the skill required to shoot a *real bullet* and miss the brain of Donald Trump intentionally... There are tens of thousands documented examples with evidence of Trump being a fiction storytelling. And Reddit itself is a cult of Trump's engaging content fiction and even photograph cult of Trump.

"is hiding aliens" - which government? People on Reddit are so fixated on Trump and MAGA and USA - do you think aliens from outer space only visit North America, and never visit Africa, Australia, Russia, China - and every government in the world is covering it up? No, what is happening here is addiction to fiction storytelling. **It is DOCUMENTED AND PROVABLE** that people read Mohammad's Quran story and BELIEVE that Allah is in out-space and that there was Adam and Eve on Eden. **IT IS DEMONSTRABLE** that people read The Bible science fiction story and believe God is in outer space sending messages to a burning bush for Moses! it is PROVABLE that people find compelling outer-space alien stories and COMPULSIVELY engage the storybook! There is EVIDENCE that "Clergy" manipulates science fiction audiences to avoid Bible verse "1 John 4:20" realization that God *is not seen*. And real human beings *are seen*.

I mean, it has more religious meaning now than a crucifix to see a pie chart. I mean, because…. **why is that so popular? Because it reduces complexity**. The **complexity is very real but his little soundbites**, his little conversations with Larry King help to reduce that complexity and they put another message in there: “Now I know it’s real complicated but we can fix it, **Americans have always fixed it and we can fix it”. Well, if Baudrillard’s right we have fixed it alright. We have fixed it all the way up and down**. And I mean, you know, we see other people engaging in this same, sort of, attempting to reduce complexity. I mean, the political parties, to the extent that they exist at all anymore as anything other than fund raising devices, which I don’t know.

Luigi's family comes from a rich golf course owning family, just like Trump. Housing prices are important, having rent go from $1,800 a month to $4,200 a month to get "free" health care is just cost shifting. All of that was thought out in January 1944. But Reddit Mario cult fandoms don't want to study and learn nonfiction on these serious and complex topics. Gun violence, gun worship is much simpler.

BEYOND_DENIAL. Yes. So many comments on Reddit are about tech-minded technology addicts, saying "traffic stops" technicalities. People are AVOIDING: mental health, corruption of the human brain, cult of commenting! PEOPLE ARE AVOIDING: Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 that is about DANGERS of MIND of Donald Trump! People are in DENIAL of the Forest for the trees of little technical details.

The cult of Reddit is only concerned to leave a "first post", "I was here" Reddit comment message about **the mass dehumanization going on in United States of America February 2026**.

I don't think people are shocked any more than the "shock" they feel watching an episode of a fiction television show when a character dies or a fiction character is hospitalized. People in USA are avoiding the "forest for the trees" perspective, avoiding reality itself, living in personalize filter-bubbles. PERSONALIZED_FILTER_BUBBLE Trump has created economic conditions where people can go to numerous media venues and comment away how much they hate other people. It's a hate-based economy. People are incredibly concerned to make their own unique personal comments about Trump and Putin events... anything to avoid getting on the same page with other people and having a common nonfiction understanding. People are far more attracted to their own personal commenting.

"not many people know" **important and relevant topics** of macroeconomics that impact everyone in USA. Alas, people are unattractive to use numerous information systems like Reddit to organize a priority-based adult education program. MAGA is a cult that celebrates ignorance, and people have all joined in with the values of avoiding the antidote to ignorance: educating and teaching adults instead of celebrating and cheering on the failures caused by ignorance.

So why are We The People not educating about number cults, the mental illness issues that billionaires have? NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH why isn't Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book with 27 contributors not being quoted over and over, repeated and repeated, on Reddit to address the public education issues about billionaire mental health?

* "the public trust is also violated if the profession fails in its duty to alert the public when a person who holds the power of life and death over us all shows signs of clear, dangerous mental impairment. We should pause if professionals are asked to remain silent when they have seen enough evidence to sound an alarm in every other situation.

ANSWER (part 1): Yes, WE, We The People can. We The People have watched Donald Trump consume and eat Twitter and digest Tweet-values like no other executive businessman. July 6, 2011 is a date we (The People) should all memorize and cite together. https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011  No other corporate America seller / CEO man saw the potential for an old white guy Father Daddy Sky Cloud Computing ("Allah" in the sky, CEO الله symbol / status symbol) symbolism like Donald Trump.

CONTEXT_ASSERTION: Free speech topics, CBS media television media. Yes, since 1985 when this was published and articulated what had *already* happened with Second Term Republican Entertainer POTUS.

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by **tech**nological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Fox News ALONE has been wrecking and poisoning any specific meaning of these words. Fox News conservatives are not technology conservatives, the USA conservatives would be the Amish I grew up and worked next to in Grabill, Indiana. Fox News HDTV wealth worship. ASSERTION: people need to focus on fiction vs. nonfiction. Trumpism is storytelling fiction-based leadership, Bible is storytelling fiction-based leadership. Anti-science. AND NAME A LIST. Don't just say "leftists", "right-wing". PLEASE oh God, NAME A NATION AND TIME PERIOD. If you want year 2030 USA to be like Japan 1980, then SAY THAT.

Trumpism right now seems like it wants to be Russia Putinism and Pakistan Taliban 2008 in many policies and attitude changes. Please on please communicate like this by NAMING a place and time period or even a fiction like "Star Trek The Next Generation" values. The "left" in Pakistan is nothing like the "left" in Canada.

* "What Cambridge Analytica observed was that when respondents were angry, their *need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced*. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits, **people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups** and urban liberals.”

ROUTINE_COMMENTING_DESCRIBING_IS_NOT_INTELLECTUALLY_RESISTING This Reddit comment is doing the Reddit cult routine of commenting itself. The cult describes the massive decline of the USA society and the causes, but has no concern to turn it around and resist intellectually. People jump on the bandwagon... adopting the very mechanisms that the billionaires used to first cult capture MAGA... it is cults all around. 

* "Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death. Year 1969.

Comment topic: COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING - alas, it's just more commenting. The Anti-FAQ anti-organizing, anti-Wiki values of Reddit is to want the problems to continue, not to organize and address the crisis and save lives and save the world from Donald Trump and Putin's plans of mass dehumanization. It's Reddit commenting "engagement" to make these, but there is no rescue or defense system being created. ROUTINE_NO_NEED_TO_RESIST_OR_ORGANIZE_INTELLECTUAL_UPRISING

The most powerful media systems ever created by mankind, USA is ground zero for electronic high speed media, have wrecked the population.

Reddit cult is deflecting from reality. Twitter-length messages on Reddit to declare that all teaching, learning, news issues, the Fox News HDTV cult is simple and trivial. DEFLECTION_FROM_BILLIONAIRES_AND_PUTINISM Has this Reddit user never encountered family or co-workers who are cultists to HDTV Fox News network from Rupert Murdoch? Does this Reddit user in the tiny-short Elon Musk programmed Twitter-thinking reactionary mindsets not realize the history of world religions and how people believe science fiction stories are actual reality? That Jesus really is in outer space? Just because a poetry fiction story is so well written.

This is what the cult does on Reddit day in and day out since June 16, 2015 - over a decade of ignoring the reality of MAGA as a fiction storytelling cult. Reddit is a cult of psychological denial that MAGA needs mental health support and rescue. Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book published October 3, 2017 with 27 contributors is ignored by the ignorant-seeking Reddit community.

"If I could denounce my citizenship and find a new country to live in with my child. I definitely would. I am ashamed to call myself an american at this point, especially living in the country that we have now with the leaders that we do." - another Reddit message to GIVE_UP_SURRENDER

I am ashamed how anti-intellectual society has become. All information systems are trashed by jokers who won't stop turning all serious topics into memes. Trump is a cult leader of Reddit fans who can't stop mocking and joking how fat, orange, obese, bad at golf, stupid, moron, dumb Trump is. The cult of mocking has turned the USA into predictable looping mindsets. Trump is God's gift to mockery and hate and Reddit / Bluesky / everywhere has turned into brain rot over how trivial and easy it is to mock a status symbol and how brilliantly intelligent everyone things they are that they are smarter than Donald Trump. The egoism of declaring how smart people are vs. Trump has ruined everything. Dumb jokes have destroyed CDC medical science. Putin won, Surkov won, USA minds are wrecked by infinite jesting.

FAN_PASSION_MAGA_VALUES Reddit media cult can not resist parroting White House talking points. There is no call to resist or organize mental health rescue campaigns. Just satire-washing, sarcasm-washing, joke-washing 24 hours a day fandom on Reddit any time an image of Donald Trump / photo of Trump appears on the touch screens via high-speed Reddit delivery. Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 authors are not good enough to use spare time and free time and be serious, the jokes are why Donald Trump has all this power. Surkov won since year 2013.

ANTI_REALITY is popular. Fiction fandoms flock to Reddit to get their Trump fiction storytelling. Factual reality and goodness are abandoned in favor of people commenting over and over about each story plot twist in the Trump fiction-based leadership. Holocaust deniers will crack jokes and memes, just like people who normalize Trump. The holocaust by Nazi Germany is a source of entertainment to fiction addicts, chucklehead mindsets, just as Donald Trump and MAGA are a source of jokes and humor "Leopards eat faces", ha ha ha ha on Reddit. AMUSING_ZOMBIES Denial via comedy-washing, joke-washing the holocaust. Detachment from goodness via meme stupor / joke mindsets.

Then why is Reddit community not protesting the wide-spread book burning on Bluesky? The blocking of writing? They didn't have Unicode text and "block button" in Germany 1937, they had to use flame and paper. But Reddit users block each other proudly - just like book burning / magazine burning / banning of books / banning of messages against the machine-think Germany 1937 society. Dehumanizing real people as machines and cheering on the silencing of others via powerful cloud computing systems run by billionaires. People don't even have the media ecology learning from Marshall McLuhan to grasp they are banning modern equivalent of books in electric media form.

Stephen Colbert ears HUGE money and is funded by massive corporations. It is the Little Guy like me who has been banned / blocked on Bluesky and Reddit and nobody stands up for me and I do not ear a single penny or sponsored / funded by anyone to promote corporate America like Colbert does.

Putin is killing people in Ukraine. Trump supports Putin. Donald Trump trusts and encourages Putin. Hate distorts the brain into thinking that killing people in Ukraine is fine. Hate distorts the mind into thinking forcing Canada to be the 51st stage of USA is a good idea. There are many many signs that hate is what Trump provides and people follow hate leadership to adopt hate values.

**The 1954 Equation**

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr

We should have multiple GOOD choices for elections.

BIBLE_LITERACY crises. Why are Bluesky and Reddit users not urgently using social information systems for the purposes of rescuing USA with teaching Bible literacy? Rescuing hearts and mins from misunderstanding and comprehension failures. **Adult education. We The People need to be teaching Bible verse Galatians 3:28 about gender. Bible verse "1 John 4:20" about liars and hate**. This is essential science fiction literacy issues. "I love Jesus" is WRONG - "1 John 4:20" verse.

* “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor.

COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING "I just don’t understand this. How was someone with these kinds of terrifying allegations able to become elected president?" ... ANSWER: media cults. Twitter-thinking. Start with study of Neil Postman's reasonable length book, 184 pages, from year 1985. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death Even reading just the first 50 or 60 pages is highly informative of what to look for.

People in rural areas stuck with television and game consoles and considered computers "nerdy". Then in year 2007 the Apple iPhone changed everything.

July 6, 2011 when Donald Trump, an old white Corporate Executive actor went all in with 140 character high-speed Twitter electric messaging system.

Let it sink in: “The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity… They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.”

Reddit cult of commenting avoids nonfiction learning. NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Dr. Bandy X Lee On the topic of the inauguration crowd size...

**QUOTE FROM YEAR 2017 NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:**   

Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.

Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for **misreporting Trump’s inauguration size**: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”

Those who **embrace Trump’s reality**, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”

That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.

**QUOTE FROM NONFICTION BOOK FROM AUGUST 2000 FOLLOWS:**

When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "**narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments**." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways.

People DO NOT REMEMBER. People are commenting over and over with low-effort comments on every media platform and not compiling FAQ / Wiki on critical important topics. RECENCY_BIAS eats away at collective mindsets, people are scattered all on different pages of topic with no organized revisiting of critical important topics.

"hilarious", with Twitter-length commenting about it. Not resisting, just commenting. SOCIAL_CULT_HATE_WATCHING_FANDOM on Reddit just comments every hour of every day for over a decade about images of Donald Trump. No concern to organize a Reddit blackout or top-25 topics list, etc. Just describing how amusing and comedic it all is to their minds. People who can't consider that MAYBE the "hilarious" is a mind exploit that Russian information warfare uses, Putin and Trump blow minds out with antics politics.

"The times we are in", UNDERSTANDING_TRUMPISM - is that July 6, 2011 Trump went all in on Twitter 140 characters, and a cult of low-effort commenting that is pro-violence and pro-hate was created. And the anti-intellectual attitudes have expanded under Putin and Trump media leadership. The answer is not more ignorance and mockery.

Reddit commenting community staring at Congress saying "why are you not doing anything!" while social media society joke-washes, humor-washes, sane-washes, comedy-washes, meme-washes Trump and MAGA as a constant source of amusement and entertainment... avoiding nonfiction serious public education from Dr. Bandy X Lee, not calling for an INTERNET WWW protest, etc. AMUSEMENT_AS_USUAL We The People of the WWwW have not stood up or organized a "We The People" open letter / protest statement.
