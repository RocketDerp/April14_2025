Top-voted Twitter-length comment. This is where free time and spare time is spent. Low-effort "The Media" of Reddit, people are not asserting important details and names of players / timelines. Just living in a land of short commenting as *social engagement* to Trump Putin Kremlin White House behaviors. This is not resisting, this is play by play audience spectatorship detachment. Sports mentality, sprots-think. People don't say they want to *stop what is happening* and cite nonfiction books, instead high-speed messaging engagement is to make thro-away commenting on it like the weather today might rain for an hour at 2:00pm. Passive and non-resisting, We The People are using spare time this way. Diluting important assertions with time spent on no-citation non-educational filler non-nutritional commenting.
