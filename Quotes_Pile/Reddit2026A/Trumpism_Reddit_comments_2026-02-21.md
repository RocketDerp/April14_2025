"They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

Another gullible Reddit user. A person thinks the government of Russia and USA are just accidentally making public scenes and creating media content for the Reddit front page. Reddit cult members do not have the cult education to recognize they are in a media consumption cult. Reddit users can't imagine comedy "The Onion" being used against the audience to trigger reactionary mindsets of name-calling the authorities as stupid and dumb via media systems.

Abuse of children is what the EPSTEIN_FANDOM desires. it gets media coverage, stimulating media content for media cults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LetsDiscussThis/comments/1rar6r9/next_up/o6lms9o/

The POSTING itself is titled, has a cult image of Donald Trump / photograph of Trump, and asks "When will America get serious about our pedophile president issue?" (again, in the posting itself, not this comment). So the Reddit user is asserting people are not serious, with an extreme short-length generic clickbait title posting of "Next Up", two words, that in no way convey the topic or subject.

As for the comment: GIVE_UP_SURRENDER to the Reddit audience. Stay inside your boxed thinking patterns, inside the box of Reddit commenting. Observe the avoidance of nonfiction teaching for the general public. Absence of Dr. Bandy X Lee book quotes, etc.

* "The **successful** sociopath’s predatory “empathy” reflects a definite perceptive acumen, making him a genius at manipulation. When this works, it produces a disastrous trust in him. Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality. The more a sociopath needs to scapegoat others the more he genuinely hates them, **making him even more aggressive and sadistic. Life is devoted to endless destruction in the service of an endless quest for power and admiration**, unmitigated by basic empathy or guilt." ― Bandy X Lee, [The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

OLDER_LANGUAGE_GOODNESS This comment uses older language phrases "Drunk on Power" and how Kings before the Founding Fathers behaved this way in the year 1776. Alas, this kind of comment needs to go further and call for social media to gather around serious remedial adult education, We The People need an urgent intellectual uprising. Starting with Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 assembled writers for her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book.

* "We believe that we can help answer these questions by emphasizing that the two propositions are not mutually exclusive. **A man can be both evil and mentally compromised — which is a more frightening proposition. Power not only corrupts but also magnifies existing psychopathologies**, even as it creates new ones. Fostered by the flattery of underlings and the chants of crowds, a political leader’s grandiosity may morph into grotesque delusions of grandeur. Sociopathic traits may be amplified as the leader discovers that he can violate the norms of civil society and even commit crimes with impunity. And the leader who rules through fear, lies, and betrayal may become increasingly isolated and paranoid, as the loyalty of even his closest confidants must forever be suspect." ― Bandy X.

COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING "Why do people just let this guy rob us blind?" ANSWER: Hate-watching is incredibly popular. Hate and mocking are the foundations of Russian information warfare that invaded Reddit and other media commenting sections since March of year 2013. Putin has used hate-inspiring media patterns to run domestic Russia for over 25 years with Surkov media techniques.

"How does anyone find this appealing?" Study the Levant religions. { Torah science fiction, Bible science fiction, Quran science fiction, Book of Mormon science fiction }. You get hate patterns between Catholics and protestants using the same identical Bible storybook. Quran book gets Shia hate with Sunni. Muslims in Mosque are extremely inspired to hate the science fiction Synagogue venue with Torah storytelling. HOW_SURKOV_WON Surkov cracked the monomyth storytelling patterns, the anti-compassion, anti-love loyalty to hate religion messaging and storytelling methods. No information warfare has ever been this potent. Russia won, NATO lost. Nobody is defending.

* “This is a new type of Kremlin propaganda, less about arguing against the West with a counter-model as in the Cold War, **more about slipping inside its language to play and taunt it** from inside. In the ad for Larry King’s show, keywords associated with the journalist flash up on screen: ‘reputation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘respect’, more and more of them until they merge into a fuzz, finishing with the jokey ‘suspenders’ (i.e. braces). Then King, sitting in a studio, turns to the camera and says: ‘I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power instead of speaking on their behalf. That’s why you can find my new show, Larry King Now, **right here on RT**. Question more.”

LIARS_AS_LEADERS Can Reddit commenting community for once and twice and persistently have a massive Reddit Blackout UPRISING? Can Reddit community stop engaging Trump antics and doing low-effort Twitter-length short-message Twitter-thinking and face that the ENTIRE POPULATION of the United States of America is avoiding the leadership of Dr. Bandy X Lee since year 2017? Again, SINCE YEAR 2017? Why is this not constantly repeated all over Reddit in commenting? To make massive hit waves on Google Search? And massive news coverage waves across the planet for an uprising?

**QUOTE FROM IMPORTANT NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:**   

Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.

Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”

Those who **embrace Trump’s reality**, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”

That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.
