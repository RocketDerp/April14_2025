"They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

Another gullible Reddit user. A person thinks the government of Russia and USA are just accidentally making public scenes and creating media content for the Reddit front page. Reddit cult members do not have the cult education to recognize they are in a media consumption cult. Reddit users can't imagine comedy "The Onion" being used against the audience to trigger reactionary mindsets of name-calling the authorities as stupid and dumb via media systems.

Abuse of children is what the EPSTEIN_FANDOM desires. it gets media coverage, stimulating media content for media cults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LetsDiscussThis/comments/1rar6r9/next_up/o6lms9o/

The POSTING itself is titled, has a cult image of Donald Trump / photograph of Trump, and asks "When will America get serious about our pedophile president issue?" (again, in the posting itself, not this comment). So the Reddit user is asserting people are not serious, with an extreme short-length generic clickbait title posting of "Next Up", two words, that in no way convey the topic or subject.

As for the comment: GIVE_UP_SURRENDER to the Reddit audience. Stay inside your boxed thinking patterns, inside the box of Reddit commenting. Observe the avoidance of nonfiction teaching for the general public. Absence of Dr. Bandy X Lee book quotes, etc.

ROUTINE_COMMENTING_DESCRIBING_IS_NOT_INTELLECTUALLY_RESISTING the Surkovian techniques are not called out by name on Reddit, as nonfiction about serious and relevant topics is avoided. A cult of avoiding nonfiction education and teaching to other adults (via Reddit commenting), there is no resistance (people are attracted and "engaged" by Trump's stimulation. Top-down programming of their mindsets).

Writing about mental health and emotional motivations. Alas: NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction is consistently and predictable avoided in the Reddit commenting media cults (cults to low-effort commenting, attracted to high-speed commenting and avoidance of nonfiction books on paper). Reddit users are consistently AVOIDING: CALL_FOR_MENTAL_HEALTH_NATIONAL_RESCUE

* "The **successful** sociopath’s predatory “empathy” reflects a definite perceptive acumen, making him a genius at manipulation. When this works, it produces a disastrous trust in him. Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality. The more a sociopath needs to scapegoat others the more he genuinely hates them, **making him even more aggressive and sadistic. Life is devoted to endless destruction in the service of an endless quest for power and admiration**, unmitigated by basic empathy or guilt." ― Bandy X Lee, [The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.
