"They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

Another gullible Reddit user. A person thinks the government of Russia and USA are just accidentally making public scenes and creating media content for the Reddit front page. Reddit cult members do not have the cult education to recognize they are in a media consumption cult. Reddit users can't imagine comedy "The Onion" being used against the audience to trigger reactionary mindsets of name-calling the authorities as stupid and dumb via media systems.

Abuse of children is what the EPSTEIN_FANDOM desires. it gets media coverage, stimulating media content for media cults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LetsDiscussThis/comments/1rar6r9/next_up/o6lms9o/

The POSTING itself is titled, has a cult image of Donald Trump / photograph of Trump, and asks "When will America get serious about our pedophile president issue?" (again, in the posting itself, not this comment). So the Reddit user is asserting people are not serious, with an extreme short-length generic clickbait title posting of "Next Up", two words, that in no way convey the topic or subject.

As for the comment: GIVE_UP_SURRENDER to the Reddit audience. Stay inside your boxed thinking patterns, inside the box of Reddit commenting. Observe the avoidance of nonfiction teaching for the general public. Absence of Dr. Bandy X Lee book quotes, etc.

* "The **successful** sociopath’s predatory “empathy” reflects a definite perceptive acumen, making him a genius at manipulation. When this works, it produces a disastrous trust in him. Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality. The more a sociopath needs to scapegoat others the more he genuinely hates them, **making him even more aggressive and sadistic. Life is devoted to endless destruction in the service of an endless quest for power and admiration**, unmitigated by basic empathy or guilt." ― Bandy X Lee, [The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

Starting with Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 assembled writers for her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book.

* "We believe that we can help answer these questions by emphasizing that the two propositions are not mutually exclusive. **A man can be both evil and mentally compromised — which is a more frightening proposition. Power not only corrupts but also magnifies existing psychopathologies**, even as it creates new ones. Fostered by the flattery of underlings and the chants of crowds, a political leader’s grandiosity may morph into grotesque delusions of grandeur. Sociopathic traits may be amplified as the leader discovers that he can violate the norms of civil society and even commit crimes with impunity. And the leader who rules through fear, lies, and betrayal may become increasingly isolated and paranoid, as the loyalty of even his closest confidants must forever be suspect." ― Bandy X.

COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING "Why do people just let this guy rob us blind?" ANSWER: Hate-watching is incredibly popular. Hate and mocking are the foundations of Russian information warfare that invaded Reddit and other media commenting sections since March of year 2013. Putin has used hate-inspiring media patterns to run domestic Russia for over 25 years with Surkov media techniques.

"How does anyone find this appealing?" Study the Levant religions. { Torah science fiction, Bible science fiction, Quran science fiction, Book of Mormon science fiction }. You get hate patterns between Catholics and protestants using the same identical Bible storybook. Quran book gets Shia hate with Sunni. Muslims in Mosque are extremely inspired to hate the science fiction Synagogue venue with Torah storytelling. HOW_SURKOV_WON Surkov cracked the monomyth storytelling patterns, the anti-compassion, anti-love loyalty to hate religion messaging and storytelling methods. No information warfare has ever been this potent. Russia won, NATO lost. Nobody is defending.

* “This is a new type of Kremlin propaganda, less about arguing against the West with a counter-model as in the Cold War, **more about slipping inside its language to play and taunt it** from inside. In the ad for Larry King’s show, keywords associated with the journalist flash up on screen: ‘reputation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘respect’, more and more of them until they merge into a fuzz, finishing with the jokey ‘suspenders’ (i.e. braces). Then King, sitting in a studio, turns to the camera and says: ‘I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power instead of speaking on their behalf. That’s why you can find my new show, Larry King Now, **right here on RT**. Question more.”

LIARS_AS_LEADERS Can Reddit commenting community for once and twice and persistently have a massive Reddit Blackout UPRISING? Can Reddit community stop engaging Trump antics and doing low-effort Twitter-length short-message Twitter-thinking and face that the ENTIRE POPULATION of the United States of America is avoiding the leadership of Dr. Bandy X Lee since year 2017? Again, SINCE YEAR 2017? Why is this not constantly repeated all over Reddit in commenting? To make massive hit waves on Google Search? And massive news coverage waves across the planet for an uprising?

**QUOTE FROM IMPORTANT NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:**   

Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.

Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”

Those who **embrace Trump’s reality**, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”

That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.

40% number is denial / represents a massive misunderstanding of entertainment media. DENIAL_ABOUNDS On a practical level, 100% of people react to Trump in USA. The 40% number does not account hate-watching. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching Trump leads with hate, and Reddit and Bluesky fandom FOLLOW the hate leadership. Promoting hate. Avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction, avoidance of Jen Senko's nonfiction. The hate fandom avoids relevant nonfiction. Surkov won since March 2013.

MAGA and Putin have shifted the way all people communicate in USA. There is a hostility. "Worship the billionaires or else" attitude. NO_PUNK_ROCK_NO_PUNK_SOCIAL_MEDIA_MINDSET This Reddit comment is so typical of the caged "inside the box" thinking of the Reddit commenting box mindsets. (Avoiding nonfiction books by Dr. Bandy X Lee, for example) Only one day in November matters, all other days just mock nonfiction away on Reddit. ELECTION_DAY_FIXATED_BRAIN_ROT_EVERY_DAY_FOX_NEWS_ETC This attitude about life I have sadly seen in other institutions like marriage: Only anniversary day matters, the other 364 days you are loveless. Only birthdays matter, every other day is tedious and the is undesirable. I've seen parents treat their own children that way about birthdays. I've seen crowds of people treat a person's entire life as tough the only thing that mattered was the technical circumstances of their death and clause of death. Some sick kind of logic thinking in the mind. Sort of how Rick Roderick describes deflationary thinking.

* "Tarski’s theory of truth goes something like this. Tarski says the sentence “Snow is white” – and he puts “Snow is white” in quotation marks – is true, if and only if snow is white. I don’t expect anybody in the audience to gasp, if you follow me. **This isn’t a theory of truth; this is the deflationary remark about how we use the word “true”, you follow me?** It’s just… this is not the upshot of what we thought were the glowing and humanistic accounts that I appreciate to this day, developed by Socrates, Aristotle, all the way through Aquinas and so on, and in the late twentieth century what we get in area after area are these – what I will call – deflationary accounts. On the upside, these accounts don’t pretend to know much. I mean, that’s the upside for me. In other words, they are not overly grand."
* ... "Well why do I start with these rather snotty remarks – if they are snotty – I mean, it may turn out that these deflationary things are all we do know: that snow is white if and only if it’s white, and that if we can’t tell whether we are free or determined after two thousand and something years, then the best attitude to take is “I don’t really give a damn” I mean, if that turns out to be the right view, we’ll leave ourselves with that. But there are some problems – and this is going to be the heart of the course – about which a deflationary view is hard to take, and one is our view of ourselves as selves, our own self reflective view about what we are as human beings, what is our place in our society and in our world, and more importantly maybe, what is our place vis-a-vis our commitments; our stations in life, our roles as husbands, wives, fathers, and I guess today to be absolutely correct about everything, significant others, significant other others, dogs and cats, whatever. I mean, you know, I’ll just cover the whole gamut here to try to be contemporary. These are questions about which it’s extremely deflationary to go “Oh yes, the self… ah, I haven’t got one”. I mean, that’s disappointing in a different kind of way."
* ... "and perhaps this difficulty in imagining it is just my difficulty in dealing with the world as it is today – it’s difficult for me to imagine anyone taking that kind of cavalier attitude about their view of themselves."

The social force of celebrity. Sunday morning this is on front page of Reddit, church day, The Bible. People on Reddit are extremely ignorant and pro-ignorance when it comes to COMPARATIVE_MYTHOLOGY - the study of society behaviors toward science fiction stories. Particularly the Levant science fiction trilogy { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon, etc }. Easter, Christmas, Trump Bible, hearing magical voices in minds from reading a poetry book. If that were artificial intelligence imagining ideas in mind because of reading a book for training, we call it "hallucination" for ChatGPT. Viral imagination of book fandoms. RELIGION_CULTS_MONOMYTH_PROGRAMMING

Celebrity cult leaders, Nicki Minaj are impressed with the cult leadership of Jesus fiction storytelling / song stories of Jesus / poetry of Jesus stories. And Trump has a cult audience right on Reddit comment section that will not REMOVE the cult leader, because the Reddit media cult fandom of Trump desires and craves the mockery leadership Trump provides. Mocking itself is the stimulation of Reddit community. Mocking Trump, mocking MAGA, mocking Elon Musk, etc, etc.

GULLIBLE_FANDOM on Reddit. Behaving with extreme recency bias. The constantly streaming meme programs on Reddit wipe out memory of Trump's total domination of media culture since June 2015. First, this topic has very little to do with removing Trump from power and turning life around away from the self-harm that the MAGA movement / ICE has been... it's just celebrity singer and celebrity actor and famous icon book. Second, this popular Reddit comment show the brain rot of We The People who encounter touch devices to consume media.

Donald Trump grasps what Reddit users do not grasp. CULT_BEHAVIOR The cult behavior of the human species about tall buildings. The pyramid on the dollar bill / Great Seal USA. Humans may have all different spoken and written languages across Earth, and argue economic systems, argue health care systems. But one things humans all agreed on across the world were: airports, tall buildings (skyscrapers), smartphones. Reddit users drown themselves in technology of high-speed information delivery but have no grasp at all that tall buildings "branded" by Donald Trump resonates deep within the everyday man as impressive.

Many rich people are collectors of exotic automobiles and are admired by men for it. Nice clothes and fashion design on women is universally attention-getting. Trump is a MASTER of icons and symbols and Trump has an eye for what crowds will flock to and photograph and cover. Standing next to places, objects, symbols that will get Trump the most media coverage is a talent and skill. Trump has an eye for juxtaposition and how to "leave his mark" and "leave his stink" like a cat or dog does.

Reddit social REEKS of Donald Trump mindsets, stink, markings. Putin winning "hearts and minds" since year 2013. Cultist "Daddy" behaviors of Reddit towards Trump. Territory, domination...

* Quote ::: "Mojo" refers to a magical charm (originating in Hoodoo) or, commonly, a person's magical, **irresistible power**, influence, or "groove". It often implies confidence, sex appeal, or talent. :::

Reddit cult of Trump absolutely can not resist his charm. People on Reddit become slaves to Trump's persona. Very predictable mindsets of Reddit consumers in calling Donald Trump: { Fat, Dumb, Stupid, Idiot, Moron, Dementia, Insane, Nuts, Smelly, Poop, Diaper Fetish, Skin Color associations }. I lived in the Middle East studying long-standing cult behaviors for years. In my lifetime (born 1969), I have never seen a celebrity cult / sports star cult / rock musician cult behave anywhere near as strong as people do regarding Donald Trump. The ultimate "King of Pop", and I saw a Michael Jackson concern in Detroit in the mid 1980's with Pepsi (Motown, his home Gary Indiana shadow of USA music culture).

Reddit comment creators and comment votes reveal a cult behavior unlike any I have seen. People who follow the hate leaership that Trump provides. People who prize hate just as Trump prizes hate. People who prize mocking and insulting just as Trump prizes mocking and insulting. People on Reddit who avoid nonfiction books on paper just as Donald Trump avoids them.

* "Being illiterate in the processes of any medium (language) leaves one at the mercy of those who control it. The new media — these new languages — then are among the most important "subjects" to be studied in the interests of survival." - Neil Postman on media ecology

The Trump brand, the signing of Holy Bible, the building markings, the golf course markings... Territorial. "Golf of America", not Mexico. Raping Canada and Greenland as 51st 52nd states... Reddit does not see the metaphorical scent that Trump has with every image that appears on /r/All of Reddit itself. The cult of hate. The media cult of mockery. Eating right out of Surkov student hands since year 2013 on Reddit.

* "Scent marking, also known as territorial marking or spraying when this involves urination, is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory. Most commonly, this is accomplished by depositing strong-smelling substances contained in the urine, faeces, or, from specialised scent glands located on various areas of the body." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)#Scent_marking

This is the foundation of celebrity Donald Trump family power. Celebrity Charlie Kirk family power. People in USA society can not resist their "Reality TV", "Reality Podcast" addictions. The attraction to the media delivery, the high-speed electric information systems.

MONOMYTH_VS_MONOMYTH Kid Rock music media monomyth cult vs. Bible monomyth media cult vs. Reddit media cult. Why is Reddit not teaching BIBLE_LITERACY of verse "1 John 4:20" and rescuing Kid Rock and his audience from such terrible reading of rock music lyrics and 2,000 year old Levant Bible stories both? "1 John 4:20" - You have never *seen God*, He is not going to smite your enemies. Reddit fandom to misunderstandings, the Kid Rock hate-watching fandom, also has this same literacy issues with Levant science fiction trilogy (Torah, Bible, Book of Mormon, Quran, etc) retcons.

* “**Half the people in the world think** that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

"One would think that after such a statement, alarm bells would start ringing for all" - one would beg and plead that Reddit users with free time and spare time to comment day and night about every news report covering Donald J.

NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH why is Reddit commenting community avoiding nonfiction serious books on the USA crisis.
