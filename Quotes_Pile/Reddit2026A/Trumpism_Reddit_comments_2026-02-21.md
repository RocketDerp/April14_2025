"They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

Another gullible Reddit user. A person thinks the government of Russia and USA are just accidentally making public scenes and creating media content for the Reddit front page. Reddit cult members do not have the cult education to recognize they are in a media consumption cult. Reddit users can't imagine comedy "The Onion" being used against the audience to trigger reactionary mindsets of name-calling the authorities as stupid and dumb via media systems.

Abuse of children is what the EPSTEIN_FANDOM desires. it gets media coverage, stimulating media content for media cults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LetsDiscussThis/comments/1rar6r9/next_up/o6lms9o/

The POSTING itself is titled, has a cult image of Donald Trump / photograph of Trump, and asks "When will America get serious about our pedophile president issue?" (again, in the posting itself, not this comment). So the Reddit user is asserting people are not serious, with an extreme short-length generic clickbait title posting of "Next Up", two words, that in no way convey the topic or subject.

As for the comment: GIVE_UP_SURRENDER to the Reddit audience. Stay inside your boxed thinking patterns, inside the box of Reddit commenting. Observe the avoidance of nonfiction teaching for the general public. Absence of Dr. Bandy X Lee book quotes, etc.

* "The **successful** sociopath’s predatory “empathy” reflects a definite perceptive acumen, making him a genius at manipulation. When this works, it produces a disastrous trust in him. Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality. The more a sociopath needs to scapegoat others the more he genuinely hates them, **making him even more aggressive and sadistic. Life is devoted to endless destruction in the service of an endless quest for power and admiration**, unmitigated by basic empathy or guilt." ― Bandy X Lee, [The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

Starting with Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 assembled writers for her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book.

* "We believe that we can help answer these questions by emphasizing that the two propositions are not mutually exclusive. **A man can be both evil and mentally compromised — which is a more frightening proposition. Power not only corrupts but also magnifies existing psychopathologies**, even as it creates new ones. Fostered by the flattery of underlings and the chants of crowds, a political leader’s grandiosity may morph into grotesque delusions of grandeur. Sociopathic traits may be amplified as the leader discovers that he can violate the norms of civil society and even commit crimes with impunity. And the leader who rules through fear, lies, and betrayal may become increasingly isolated and paranoid, as the loyalty of even his closest confidants must forever be suspect." ― Bandy X.

COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING "Why do people just let this guy rob us blind?" ANSWER: Hate-watching is incredibly popular. Hate and mocking are the foundations of Russian information warfare that invaded Reddit and other media commenting sections since March of year 2013. Putin has used hate-inspiring media patterns to run domestic Russia for over 25 years with Surkov media techniques.

"How does anyone find this appealing?" Study the Levant religions. { Torah science fiction, Bible science fiction, Quran science fiction, Book of Mormon science fiction }. You get hate patterns between Catholics and protestants using the same identical Bible storybook. Quran book gets Shia hate with Sunni. Muslims in Mosque are extremely inspired to hate the science fiction Synagogue venue with Torah storytelling. HOW_SURKOV_WON Surkov cracked the monomyth storytelling patterns, the anti-compassion, anti-love loyalty to hate religion messaging and storytelling methods. No information warfare has ever been this potent. Russia won, NATO lost. Nobody is defending.

* “This is a new type of Kremlin propaganda, less about arguing against the West with a counter-model as in the Cold War, **more about slipping inside its language to play and taunt it** from inside. In the ad for Larry King’s show, keywords associated with the journalist flash up on screen: ‘reputation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘respect’, more and more of them until they merge into a fuzz, finishing with the jokey ‘suspenders’ (i.e. braces). Then King, sitting in a studio, turns to the camera and says: ‘I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power instead of speaking on their behalf. That’s why you can find my new show, Larry King Now, **right here on RT**. Question more.”

LIARS_AS_LEADERS Can Reddit commenting community for once and twice and persistently have a massive Reddit Blackout UPRISING? Can Reddit community stop engaging Trump antics and doing low-effort Twitter-length short-message Twitter-thinking and face that the ENTIRE POPULATION of the United States of America is avoiding the leadership of Dr. Bandy X Lee since year 2017? Again, SINCE YEAR 2017? Why is this not constantly repeated all over Reddit in commenting? To make massive hit waves on Google Search? And massive news coverage waves across the planet for an uprising?

**QUOTE FROM IMPORTANT NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:**   

Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.

Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”

Those who **embrace Trump’s reality**, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”

That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.

The 40% number does not account hate-watching. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching Trump leads with hate, and Reddit and Bluesky fandom FOLLOW the hate leadership. Promoting hate.

MAGA and Putin have shifted the way all people communicate in USA. There is a hostility. "Worship the billionaires or else" attitude. NO_PUNK_ROCK_NO_PUNK_SOCIAL_MEDIA_MINDSET This Reddit comment is so typical of the caged "inside the box" thinking of the Reddit commenting box mindsets. (Avoiding nonfiction books by Dr. Bandy X Lee, for example) Only one day in November matters, all other days just mock nonfiction away on Reddit. ELECTION_DAY_FIXATED_BRAIN_ROT_EVERY_DAY_FOX_NEWS_ETC This attitude about life I have sadly seen in other institutions like marriage: Only anniversary day matters, the other 364 days you are loveless. Only birthdays matter, every other day is tedious and the is undesirable. I've seen parents treat their own children that way about birthdays. I've seen crowds of people treat a person's entire life as tough the only thing that mattered was the technical circumstances of their death and clause of death. Some sick kind of logic thinking in the mind. Sort of how Rick Roderick describes deflationary thinking.

* "Tarski’s theory of truth goes something like this. Tarski says the sentence “Snow is white” – and he puts “Snow is white” in quotation marks – is true, if and only if snow is white. I don’t expect anybody in the audience to gasp, if you follow me. **This isn’t a theory of truth; this is the deflationary remark about how we use the word “true”, you follow me?** It’s just… this is not the upshot of what we thought were the glowing and humanistic accounts that I appreciate to this day, developed by Socrates, Aristotle, all the way through Aquinas and so on, and in the late twentieth century what we get in area after area are these – what I will call – deflationary accounts. On the upside, these accounts don’t pretend to know much. I mean, that’s the upside for me. In other words, they are not overly grand."
* ... "Well why do I start with these rather snotty remarks – if they are snotty – I mean, it may turn out that these deflationary things are all we do know: that snow is white if and only if it’s white, and that if we can’t tell whether we are free or determined after two thousand and something years, then the best attitude to take is “I don’t really give a damn” I mean, if that turns out to be the right view, we’ll leave ourselves with that. But there are some problems – and this is going to be the heart of the course – about which a deflationary view is hard to take, and one is our view of ourselves as selves, our own self reflective view about what we are as human beings, what is our place in our society and in our world, and more importantly maybe, what is our place vis-a-vis our commitments; our stations in life, our roles as husbands, wives, fathers, and I guess today to be absolutely correct about everything, significant others, significant other others, dogs and cats, whatever. I mean, you know, I’ll just cover the whole gamut here to try to be contemporary. These are questions about which it’s extremely deflationary to go “Oh yes, the self… ah, I haven’t got one”. I mean, that’s disappointing in a different kind of way."
* ... "and perhaps this difficulty in imagining it is just my difficulty in dealing with the world as it is today – it’s difficult for me to imagine anyone taking that kind of cavalier attitude about their view of themselves."

The social force of celebrity. Sunday morning this is on front page of Reddit, church day, The Bible. People on Reddit are extremely ignorant and pro-ignorance when it comes to COMPARATIVE_MYTHOLOGY - the study of society behaviors toward science fiction stories. Particularly the Levant science fiction trilogy { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon, etc }. Easter, Christmas, Trump Bible, hearing magical voices in minds from reading a poetry book. If that were artificial intelligence imagining ideas in mind because of reading a book for training, we call it "hallucination" for ChatGPT. Viral imagination of book fandoms. RELIGION_CULTS_MONOMYTH_PROGRAMMING

Celebrity cult leaders, Nicki Minaj are impressed with the cult leadership of Jesus fiction storytelling / song stories of Jesus / poetry of Jesus stories. And Trump has a cult audience right on Reddit comment section that will not REMOVE the cult leader, because the Reddit media cult fandom of Trump desires and craves the mockery leadership Trump provides. Mocking itself is the stimulation of Reddit community. Mocking Trump, mocking MAGA, mocking Elon Musk, etc, etc.

GULLIBLE_FANDOM on Reddit. Behaving with extreme recency bias. The constantly streaming meme programs on Reddit wipe out memory of Trump's total domination of media culture since June 2015. First, this topic has very little to do with removing Trump from power and turning life around away from the self-harm that the MAGA movement / ICE has been... it's just celebrity singer and celebrity actor and famous icon book. Second, this popular Reddit comment show the brain rot of We The People who encounter touch devices to consume media.

Donald Trump grasps what Reddit users do not grasp. CULT_BEHAVIOR The cult behavior of the human species about tall buildings. The pyramid on the dollar bill / Great Seal USA. Humans may have all different spoken and written languages across Earth, and argue economic systems, argue health care systems. But one things humans all agreed on across the world were: airports, tall buildings (skyscrapers), smartphones. Reddit users drown themselves in technology of high-speed information delivery but have no grasp at all that tall buildings "branded" by Donald Trump resonates deep within the everyday man as impressive.

Many rich people are collectors of exotic automobiles and are admired by men for it. Nice clothes and fashion design on women is universally attention-getting. Trump is a MASTER of icons and symbols and Trump has an eye for what crowds will flock to and photograph and cover. Standing next to places, objects, symbols that will get Trump the most media coverage is a talent and skill. Trump has an eye for juxtaposition and how to "leave his mark" and "leave his stink" like a cat or dog does.

Reddit social REEKS of Donald Trump mindsets, stink, markings. Putin winning "hearts and minds" since year 2013. Cultist "Daddy" behaviors of Reddit towards Trump. Territory, domination...

* Quote ::: "Mojo" refers to a magical charm (originating in Hoodoo) or, commonly, a person's magical, **irresistible power**, influence, or "groove". It often implies confidence, sex appeal, or talent. :::

Reddit cult of Trump absolutely can not resist his charm. People on Reddit become slaves to Trump's persona. Very predictable mindsets of Reddit consumers in calling Donald Trump: { Fat, Dumb, Stupid, Idiot, Moron, Dementia, Insane, Nuts, Smelly, Poop, Diaper Fetish, Skin Color associations }. I lived in the Middle East studying long-standing cult behaviors for years. In my lifetime (born 1969), I have never seen a celebrity cult / sports star cult / rock musician cult behave anywhere near as strong as people do regarding Donald Trump. The ultimate "King of Pop", and I saw a Michael Jackson concern in Detroit in the mid 1980's with Pepsi (Motown, his home Gary Indiana shadow of USA music culture).

Reddit comment creators and comment votes reveal a cult behavior unlike any I have seen. People who follow the hate leaership that Trump provides. People who prize hate just as Trump prizes hate. People who prize mocking and insulting just as Trump prizes mocking and insulting. People on Reddit who avoid nonfiction books on paper just as Donald Trump avoids them.

* "Being illiterate in the processes of any medium (language) leaves one at the mercy of those who control it. The new media — these new languages — then are among the most important "subjects" to be studied in the interests of survival." - Neil Postman on media ecology

The Trump brand, the signing of Holy Bible, the building markings, the golf course markings... Territorial. "Golf of America", not Mexico. Raping Canada and Greenland as 51st 52nd states... Reddit does not see the metaphorical scent that Trump has with every image that appears on /r/All of Reddit itself. The cult of hate. The media cult of mockery. Eating right out of Surkov student hands since year 2013 on Reddit.

* "Scent marking, also known as territorial marking or spraying when this involves urination, is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory. Most commonly, this is accomplished by depositing strong-smelling substances contained in the urine, faeces, or, from specialised scent glands located on various areas of the body." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)#Scent_marking

Why is Reddit not teaching BIBLE_LITERACY of verse "1 John 4:20" and rescuing Kid Rock and his audience from such terrible reading of rock music lyrics and 2,000 year old Levant Bible stories both? "1 John 4:20" - You have never *seen God*, He is not going to smite your enemies. Reddit fandom to misunderstandings, the Kid Rock hate-watching fandom, also has this same literacy issues with Levant science fiction trilogy (Torah, Bible, Book of Mormon, Quran, etc) retcons.

* “**Half the people in the world think** that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all.

September 9, 2014 https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/

Exactly the kind of technique that the TSA is doing with world travel affairs. Self-harm to USA as a method of control.

* "What this film is going to suggest is that that defeatist response has become a central part of a new system of political control. And to understand how this is happening, you have to look to Russia, to a man called Vladislav Surkov, who is a hero of our time." - December 31, 2014. year 2014.

 Claims we are not stupid. Same old STUPID_VS_STUPID claims of out-group is the dumb stupid ones. OBSERVE: Reddit community is not quoting nonfiction books or linking nonfiction relevant information on topics. Why is Reddit commenting community not calling for a Reddit blackout protest, an online protest to break all previous Reddit protest records? Why is the Reddit commenting community not citing Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction books for the general public about Trump's mental health? ANSWER: A cult of commenting how stupid and dumb everyone else is in feedback loops via high-speed messaging is the Reddit addictions. 

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

CALL_TO_INTELLECTUAL_ACTION_PLAN why not require, going forward, beyond this... that any public broadcast that has a Tourette Syndrome audience member present, for accommodation, agree to being filmed and recorded. And if any compulsive outbursts are induced into the central broadcast of the content... then the person who did the outburst has their video released for the sake of documenting the behavior. This serves to educate the general public. It also focuses on those who broadcast being held responsible (the Tourette Syndrome audience member being identified as the source of offensive content). OTHERWISE, the accommodations for such a person would be to build some kind of soundproof seating at the live performance.

Consideration should also be given even if it is not broadcast where censor cut time-delay is common. As people in the audience itself are still exposed to the messages.

As for the comment... “Everyone loved Martin Luther King!” and the anti-Wiki anti-FAQ anti-Truth values of February 2026 society that has **abandoned nonfiction learning of truth** topics. In favor of addiction and cult followings of fiction storytelling.

* "Deep down in **our nonviolent creed** is the conviction that there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things **so eternally true** that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36 years old, as I happen to be, and some great truth stands before the door of his life, some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right, he's afraid his home will get burned, or he's **afraid that he will lose his job**, or he's afraid that he will get shot or beat down by state troopers. He may go on and live until he's 80, but he's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. And the cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier **death of the spirit**. He died... A man dies when he refuses to stand up for **that which is right**. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. **A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true**." - March 8, 1965

It is a society that celebrates ignorance and low-effort commenting instead of authentic intellectual progress and better understanding / comprehension. Anti-Malala anti-education anti-teaching reforms. The no-identity commenting on social systems is prized over authentic adult nonfiction books on paper with author names. Reddit audience is very anti-intellectual in year 2026, avoidant of FAQ and Wiki creation of organized focus "on the same page" - and instead flocks to scattered fragmented commenting messages.

* "The extremists are afraid of books and pens. **The power of education frightens them**. They are afraid of women. The power of **the voice of women frightens them**. This is why they killed 14 innocent students in the recent attack in Quetta. And that is why they kill female teachers. That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are **afraid of change and equality that we will bring to our society**. And I remember that there was a boy in our school who was asked by a journalist why are the Taliban against education? He answered very simply by pointing to his book, he said, "a Talib doesn't know what is written inside this book."

Trump fandom is a hate fandom. FAITH_IN_HATE PizzaCake's experience on Reddit is gun-worship USA social values. GUN_WORSHIP anti-intellectual to the core. Shoot every MAGA person with a gun instead of teaching cult deprogramming (serious nonfiction adult education using Reddit itself is avoided). Trump leads with hate and followers on Reddit follow the hate.

Attacking NATO Canada makes ZERO SENSE economically or for any reason other than to self-harm the future of the USA. The avoidance of NONFICTION SERIOUS BOOKS about cults and mental health (Dr. Lee) I am DOCUMENTING! Because people on Reddit will DENY and not learn the crisis of mythology leadership, fiction vs. nonfiction leadership. We The People are not standing in the street holding signs saying: "We All Need to Promote Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership and get on the same page together as a nation!". The AVOIDANCE of RELEVANT NONFICTION BOOKS is OBVIOUS if you LOOK AROUND! SELF-EVIDENT! Screaming "Dementia, orange, poop diapers" is NOT addressing the DANGER!

Somewhere somebody must have** a little sense, and that's the strong person. The strong person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate, the chain of evil. And that is the tragedy of hate, that it doesn't cut it off. It only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe. **Somebody must have religion enough and morality enough to cut it off** and inject within the very structure of the universe that strong and powerful element of love."; "Somewhere somebody must have some sense. Men must see that force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody **must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe**. And you do that by love." - November 17, 1957

ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH woman Dr. Bandy X Lee's assembling of 27 people writing words about the DANGER Donald Trump is to the nation October 3, 2017. But the only words that people care about is commenting words. The constant avoidance of nonfiction books printed on paper is there if you look at social media users and "No Kings" protests and ICE protest. People are avoidant of learning and always engaging exactly what Donald Trump provides: Mocking, insulting, anti-learning, anti-education, anti-Malala values. The *commenting about Trump* is all people learn any more, the latest patterns of insulting, joking, mockery. When Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon are the methods of communications that people think wins all debate, you get Donald Trump making videos about playing on the hockey team.

The population, the society, We The People, wrecked the future of their children so they could play toy-game with an Apple iPhone and Apple iPad and Android devices using apps. An entire nation wrecked itself because of Reality Television being more important than loving neighbors in Mexico and Cuba. Because people care more about hating their "ex lover" and disappointing neighbor - they insisted to put the most terrible person up on television every day to be stimulated into having crowds form around lighted screens to discuss just how much hate is the most important thing to the future of the United States of America... and what we always dreamed up was having a machine in our hands to touch and spread hate all over the World Wide Web in the nae of waking up to beeps and vibrations that the future really needs to have more comments about how stupid and dumb one person is over and over. The population sold-out health care, education, healthy food... just so that machine held in the hand could deliver messages about a terrible person over and over in every variation and pattern imaginable.

* "That shows that court orders just don't matter anymore." - Reddit comment

Reddit avoidance of nonfiction books shows that the entire society has found itself so attracted to a leader of hate that goodness does not matter anymore. How many years has it been since Donald Trump became content on every media system and news platform and topic of society?

Love your neighbor doesn't matter anymore. Parenting your children with good education and understanding of life outside television and life outside Trump Truth Social doesn't matter anymore. Women and what they have to say doesn't matter anymore. If I had to put my finger on what actually does matter to people, it is is fingering a touch screen to make jokes, memes, comments about one single person: Donald J. Trump, over and over and over. Like drug addicts who go to the trap house to get their fix of Trump media, Trump content. TRICKLE_DOWN_MEDIA of Trump cult stimulation.

It is a social movement that has spread across the world from Russia. Winning hearts and minds to follow hate leadership of Putin. How does this idea spread? Media systems. Newspapers, magazines, newsletters, leaflets, postings, billboards, messages paid for by billionaires like Rupert Murdoch who has a global network of urgent message delivery. And, somehow, the consumers of media are convinced that the "dumb" "stupid" problem lies not with the audience. But that we need to *ban* and *block* television channels like Fox News. We should  not criticize the Reddit audience for putting MAGA hat photographs on the front page of Reddit in full color. Because no way would a man in Russia named "Surkov" have inspired a network of media systems to all behave the same way.

* BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, established in year 1927 as a public corporation... headquartered in London. On December 31, 2014 broadcast these words: "But **maybe, we have something similar emerging here in Britain. Everything we're told by journalists and politicians is confusing and contradictory. Of course, there is no Mr. Surkov in charge**, but it is an odd, non-linear world that plays into the hands of those in power." - year 2014.

 South Park, Family Guy. "He's such an embarrassment". The audience who recognizes "Family Guy" animated show in Donald Trump's content says more about the audience than the POTUS Tony Clifton act that Trump is acting. If Trump is not great at economics, what is Trump's skill that puts him in the center of every media system in USA? if Trump is not good at diplomacy and trade agreements, then what exactly is the talent that Trump has in getting at the center of every conversation on Reddit for 3,906 days in a row? Does anyone remember that being a "socialite" and "influencer" on television, that being on Reality TV is the thing Donald Trump was popular January 8, 2004 on NBC? Just maybe, the problem is THE AUDIENCE, the fandom, that watches Family Guy...

1. "Winning hearts and minds is a concept occasionally expressed in the resolution of war, insurgency, and other conflicts, in which one side seeks to prevail not by the use of superior force, but by making emotional or intellectual appeals to sway supporters of the other side. The term "hearts and minds" was first used by French general Hubert Lyautey. The use of the term "hearts and minds" to reference a method of bringing a subjugated population on side, was first used by French general and colonial administrator Hubert Lyautey as part of his strategy to counter the Black Flags rebellion during the Tonkin campaign in 1895." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_hearts_and_minds

OUTBREAKS_OF_MOB_CULT_BEHAVIORS Donald Trump is a symptom of the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency targeting NATO, multiple nations, that resonated most with the ignorance celebrators in USA. Trump makes no sense as a leader, ignorant rural people do not trust a "City Slicker" Playboy who lives in a Penthouse in NYC. A man in a business suit does not connect with rural less-educated "red areas" of the nation... what changed was the Apple iPhone / Apple iPad / Android smart devices reaching the rural area and allowing the St. Pete IRA into hearts and minds. DENIAL_ABOUNDS Surkov won since March 2013.

It is important to understand: **We The People can call for impeachment and removal**. We can make a mistake or error. But when impeachment over Russia / Putin... "was officially announced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi on September 24, 2019" - where was the REDDIT_BLACKOUT ? When did Reddit users have an INTELLECTUAL uprising to call for truth, honesty, goodness, sincerity in government? When did We The People on Reddit social get into the world newspapers in September 2019, October 2019, November 2019, December 2019 for a massive Internet WWW protest and blackout?

We The People can get drunk on memes, drunk on Apple iPhone TCP/IP power of high-speed information delivery.. but We The People can *sober up* and organize an online nonfiction book quotation of Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book in October 2019 (two years later).. yet, We The People find trump so thrilling as a source of entertainment and amusement - that We The People have no evidence of a major Internet protest and blackout in Q4 2019. Right before the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a chance to REMOVE Donald Trump from office. But We The People did not stand up to Trump a an Internet cyberbully. We followed the Trump leadership of always avoiding the nonfiction section of the public library, avoiding relevant books on paper. People follow Trump's Twitter leadership behaviors instead, anti-book, anti-study, anti-learning, anti-girls, anti-women, anti Dr. Lee woman. Anti Nancy Pelosi's leadership September 24, 2019 woman.

"A torrent that began in 2014. I am so tired of lies." - YES, not 2016, but years before the election. Trumpism didn't just start after he took office in January 2017. " It's everything the 80s said was true of the USSR." - Excellent understanding. Alas, we need to connect this "the 80s" talk to Neil Postman's year 1985 book and see what issue we are up against. 

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

And this cited Reddit comment will get drowned out as everyone is commenting away on different sites and pages on those sites. There is no call for FAQ, no call for Wiki, no call for nonfiction books to all get on the same pages at the same times :( It is entirely normalized to avoid relevant nonfiction books on paper now in USA society.

Yes. Trump is not alone. The abandonment of nonfiction relevant books on paper is a NATIONAL issue of THE ENTIRE POPULATION. Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017 being ignored and avoided by the Reddit community, Bluesky community... I am calling out over and over and over on this GitHub project. Trump is not the only one, the Supreme Court SCOTUS is not the only ones, **it is an entire nation (population over age 12) avoiding the leadership of 27 people since October of year 2017 that Dr. Lee assembled.

TRUMP_FANDOM on Reddit giving prayers to God that Trump is maximum nonsense and chaos for thrilling exciting entertainment and mockery. The bewildering Tony Clifton performance is what has attracted the fandom to Trump all along since June 16, 2015. More than a decade of people prizing Trump messages and videos as a source of amusement and comedy. The best Tony Clifton character performer in history. Gullible audience thinks that what we need is FICTION_HARDER - that we need NONSENSE_HARDER cries for more and more Trump family content to comment about. Cult of ignorance. Celebrating the ignorance source and ignorance leadership Trump provides.

AMUSEMENT_COMEDY_WASHING_TRUMP_AS_FUNNY_MEDIA_SANEWASHING Trump is in power because joke-washing and comedy-washing Trump is so incredibly popular. Popularity itself is toxic.

SYMBOLISM_GUMBO - and as if Trump is the only person in the world to figure out that having your photograph taken next to a sexy car or a sexy woman makes you popular. That tall buildings with your name on them don't get the world swooning. Putin and Trump, Saudi Arabia owners of Mecca, it is a game that fandoms never tire of it seems. Or we would all turn to comparative mythology. Trump tower buildings, golf course meeting places.

* "The Power of Myth" filmed by George Lucas at the height of his popularity and cultural influence in 1985, 1986, 1987 to educate the Star Wars fandom. Nonfiction book published in year 1988. "CAMPBELL: It takes me back to a time when these spiritual principles informed the society. You can tell what’s informing a society by what the tallest building is. When you approach a medieval town, the cathedral is the tallest thing in the place. When you approach an eighteenth-century town, it is the political palace that’s the tallest thing in the place. And when you approach a modern city, the tallest places are the office buildings, the centers of economic life. **If you go to Salt Lake City, you see the whole thing illustrated right in front of your face. First the temple was built, right in the center of the city. This is the proper organization because the temple is the spiritual center from which everything flows in all directions. Then the political building, the Capitol, was built beside it, and it’s taller than the temple. And now the tallest thing is the office building that takes care of the affairs** of both the temple and the political building. That’s the history of Western civilization. From the Gothic through the princely periods of the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth centuries, to this economic world that we’re in now."

STAND_UP_FOR_THE_BIG_GUY Imagine a population of educated intelligent people who spend all their free time commenting about Donald Trump with low-effort messages. People always avoiding using the same spare time and free time to promote and quote nonfiction relevant books. Such as Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 about the DANGER of Donald Trump and his mental health. Instead, commenting about every photograph of Donald Trump in the White House is how so many people in USA population behaves. Year after year after year, attraction to Trump images.
