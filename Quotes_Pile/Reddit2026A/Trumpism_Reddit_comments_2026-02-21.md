:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
I don’t understand why people have such a problem with high school kids protesting. They’ve never lived in a time when things are normal. They probably don’t have a lot of hope about their future, or maybe even see how continuing education will benefit them, so fuck school. They HAVE to protest. They see no accountability in the adults in charge, so they have to fight.

> "They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

They're still [in custody](https://patch.com/pennsylvania/doylestown/students-stage-ice-walkout-engage-police-quakertown). The article says they're holding them until Monday.

The guy who started this whole thing is allegedly the Chief of Police, Scott McElree. He is also the Borough Manager. Both positions are appointed by the Borough Council.

I'm calling the Borough Council to tell them that this guy needs to be removed from both positions.

Here's the info for anyone else who might want to do the same:

You would think that by now these dumbass cops would realize that they are constantly being filmed when in public. And therefore act accordingly. Their arrogance is astounding. They really seem to think that they can continue to get away with abusing the public like they did for decades before everyone had a phone w camera in their pocket.

These are grown adult men beating on children. The police chief is attacking a teenage girl? And then she got arrested? Is that seriously just what happened? Incompetent idiots.

Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality.

Post Title:      Trump vows to raise worldwide tariffs to 15% ‘effective immediately’

> CALL_FOR_ACTION_TO_DO_TRIVIAL_CHANGE This Reddit user is encouraging the Trump-content cult members on Reddit to make a trivial media-content change. To change the name of a prop in the Reality TV White House Kremlin show. The fandom does not call to arms for Dr. Bandy X Lee's mental health public education. Instead the fandom calls for screenplay changes, the name of a character. No call to REMOVE the tariffs, just to give them a different name for the audience on Reddit. This is what an engaged fandom does, this is Reddit behavior. This is fans in a crowd crying out to the performer on stage to change a line in the show! Glued to their Reddit device screens.

I can’t believe how little he seems to care. It’s fucking unbelievable. He’s piling taxes on us in an already struggling economy. Every additional percent just drives up the price of everything.

Your whole system is flawed, f both parties, both parties had these files for years on their hands. The only difference is that it is now public info.

Unless you guys go out and actually riot, you are just going to be ruled by a different pedo party, nothing changes, no one will ever be held accountable.

I think you’ve fallen into the trap that they’ve set, where they’ve divided all of us simpletons into two different teams that fight each other, while they go about their business fucking children and raking in billions. If you think it’s just republicans, then you’re thinking what they want you to think, and republicans are thinking what they’re supposed to think as well. And round and round we go.

Can people just let go? The people in charge do not care about ethics that you do.

If you want to see change, you have to take charge. You can't depend on others to do it for you. If you fork over your money to them with taxes, they'll just take it all from you and give you nothing back.

Either realize this and take real action, or continue to complain and hope that something will happen

I'm sorry to the victims that this is REALITY but you can't sit your ass in front of a monitor and just expect change.

What? The E. Jean Carrol trial was a massive deal and in the news every day at the time. He was found liable. It was a civil case because statute of limitations had passed.

A lot of Gen Z make absolutely zero effort to access news beyond your social media feeds and then are shocked and offended when they miss huge stories. Maybe a moment for self reflection.

Post Title:      Trump imposes 15% tariffs on the world  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Because the US is filled with 'yes' politicians which would sell their mother for a half a pack of cigs and a crate of beer.

Your entire political system not only allows but encourages it's politicians to benefit from their position (lobbying or bribing which ever word you prefer), so they represent the people that pay them, not the people that vote for them.

You get hate patterns between Catholics and protestants using the same identical Bible storybook. Quran book gets Shia hate with Sunni. Muslims in Mosque are extremely inspired to hate the science fiction Synagogue venue with Torah storytelling. HOW_SURKOV_WON Surkov cracked the monomyth storytelling patterns, the anti-compassion, anti-love loyalty to hate religion messaging and storytelling methods. No information warfare has ever been this potent. Russia won, NATO lost. Nobody is defending.

In the ad for Larry King’s show, keywords associated with the journalist flash up on screen: ‘reputation’, ‘intelligence’, ‘respect’, more and more of them until they merge into a fuzz, finishing with the jokey ‘suspenders’ (i.e. braces). Then King, sitting in a studio, turns to the camera and says: ‘I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power instead of speaking on their behalf. That’s why you can find my new show, Larry King Now, **right here on RT**. Question more.”

> Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.
> 
> Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”

The "State of Trump" will be on Tv Tuesday night. They used to call it the State of the Union. Here is a preview. His face will be orange, but his neck and ears will be white. He will be scowling. He will waddle to the podium like an old sick hippo. And then blame Americans for hurting his poor boo boo feelings for the next 70 minutes. Pam Bondi will be standing the whole time, complete with her wittle orange pom poms and screaming Make Trump Great Again over and over. Spraying everyone around her with her juice as she squeals at the end of the cheer saying his name, and the errand boys in Congress who do what he tells them to do, when he tells them to do it. will get more exercise standing up and sitting down and standing up and sitting down for 70 minutes, than they have had in a year. He will declare himself God towards the end as he mumbles, slurs his words and spits, and maybe . . . the tv coverage will end. Because no Americans are watching this shit.

NO_PUNK_ROCK_NO_PUNK_SOCIAL_MEDIA_MINDSET This Reddit comment is so typical of the caged "inside the box" thinking of the Reddit commenting box mindsets. (Avoiding nonfiction books by Dr. Bandy X Lee, for example) Only one day in November matters, all other days just mock nonfiction away on Reddit. ELECTION_DAY_FIXATED_BRAIN_ROT_EVERY_DAY_FOX_NEWS_ETC This attitude about life I have sadly seen in other institutions like marriage: Only anniversary day matters, the other 364 days you are loveless. Only birthdays matter, every other day is tedious and the is undesirable. I've seen parents treat their own children that way about birthdays. I've seen crowds of people treat a person's entire life as tough the only thing that mattered was the technical circumstances of their death and clause of death. Some sick kind of logic thinking in the mind. Sort of how Rick Roderick describes deflationary thinking.

I don’t expect anybody in the audience to gasp, if you follow me. **This isn’t a theory of truth; this is the deflationary remark about how we use the word “true”, you follow me?** It’s just… this is not the upshot of what we thought were the glowing and humanistic accounts that I appreciate to this day, developed by Socrates, Aristotle, all the way through Aquinas and so on, and in the late twentieth century what we get in area after area are these – what I will call – deflationary accounts. On the upside, these accounts don’t pretend to know much. I mean, that’s the upside for me. In other words, they are not overly grand."

"Well why do I start with these rather snotty remarks – if they are snotty – I mean, it may turn out that these deflationary things are all we do know: that snow is white if and only if it’s white, and that if we can’t tell whether we are free or determined after two thousand and something years, then the best attitude to take is “I don’t really give a damn” I mean, if that turns out to be the right view, we’ll leave ourselves with that. But there are some problems – and this is going to be the heart of the course – about which a deflationary view is hard to take, and one is our view of ourselves as selves, our own self reflective view about what we are as human beings, what is our place in our society and in our world, and more importantly maybe, what is our place vis-a-vis our commitments; our stations in life, our roles as husbands, wives, fathers, and I guess today to be absolutely correct about everything, significant others, significant other others, dogs and cats, whatever. I mean, you know, I’ll just cover the whole gamut here to try to be contemporary. These are questions about which it’s extremely deflationary to go “Oh yes, the self… ah, I haven’t got one”. I mean, that’s disappointing in a different kind of way."

In my lifetime (born 1969), I have never seen a celebrity cult / sports star cult / rock musician cult behave anywhere near as strong as people do regarding Donald Trump. The ultimate "King of Pop", and I saw a Michael Jackson concern in Detroit in the mid 1980's with Pepsi (Motown, his home Gary Indiana shadow of USA music culture).

Any president who publicly rants about his ability to destroy trade and destroy the nation should be immediately impeached and removed from office, or removed via the 25th Amendment. He's openly declaring that he's allowed to destroy the country.

Why are all the news neetworks not covering a social media uprising? Why is the DANGER book published by Dr. Bandy X Lee with 27 authors since October 3, 2017 not being quoted constantly to raise alarm bells in specific nonfiction language to get everyone on the same page of DANGER?

Post Title:      Trump Is Rage Baiting the US Into a Second Civil War - In a healthy democracy, all sides generally recognize the legitimacy of the system itself, regardless of internal squabbles. In the United States, this is no longer the case.  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Calling it “rage baiting” feels accurate. Donald Trump has basically mastered the art of saying something inflammatory, watching the outrage cycle spin, and then fundraising off it.

I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

It would be hilarious if more impersonators did this. Watching the talking heads who have spent a decade sanewashing Trump and giving him so much air time having to struggle between a moment of wondering "Should we cut the mic on this idiot and move on before he says something stupid?" to "What if it's THE idiot? Our ratings golden goose and we just cut his air time?!" would be ironic.

What are the odds that although the show is edited, they chose to broadcast this on the night Ryan Coogler makes history as the first black person to win Best Original Screenplay and Wumni Mosaku also winning Supporting Actress for a movie with a predominantly black cast? It feels like a way to divert attention away from the amazing achievements of these black people. 

It also feels like another way to garner interest and attention to the BAFTAs at the expense of a man with a severe disability, the black actors that were affected, and the black audience at large. 

I know I may sound like a cynical conspiracy theorist, but it’s hard not to be one about this. It’s exploitative of everyone involved, and I think we need to talk about why the ABC network chose to keep this in while editing out other distressing tics and activism shoutouts.

Edit: spelling errors

We continue to let others minimize this and instead turn it into a conversation about intolerance or lack of understanding of Tourette’s. The reality is that the Baftas allowed this to happen publicly, either intentionally or negligently. And Tourette’s or not, I didn’t hear of any episodes when anyone Jewish, Indian, transsexual or other hit the stage. Excuses and diseases aside this was not acceptable by the Bafta production crew, network, or individual. At a bare minimum it deserved acknowledgment.


> [!NOTE]
> :::::: Analysis_Thoughts Commentary: ======  
> CALL_TO_INTELLECTUAL_ACTION_PLAN why not require, going forward, beyond this... that any public broadcast that has a Tourette Syndrome audience member present, for accommodation, agree to being filmed and recorded. And if any compulsive outbursts are induced into the central broadcast of the content... then the person who did the outburst has their video released for the sake of documenting the behavior. This serves to educate the general public. It also focuses on those who broadcast being held responsible (the Tourette Syndrome audience member being identified as the source of offensive content). OTHERWISE, the accommodations for such a person would be to build some kind of soundproof seating at the live performance.

Well, **if Baudrillard’s right we have fixed it alright. We have fixed it all the way up and down**. And I mean, you know, we see other people engaging in this same, sort of, attempting to reduce complexity.

> 4 month Reddit account. Extreme tiny-short reactionary messages. Reacting to Trump all the time every day all across USA society to behave like Truth Social programmed mindsets ruins everything. Why does nobody follow Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership on Reddit? Why are people not constantly quoting Dr. Lee over and over on Reddit? Because she is an intelligent woman, and the anti-intellectual short-commenting lovers of Reddit don't like a woman who uses big complex quotable words and language? Tiny short commenting on Reddit as 'engagement' to Trump. HIGH_SPEED_REACTIONARY_MINDSETS

This is performative. "Who did you fire?" Is not the right question to be asking. That really just opens the door for the company to pin the blame on someone, and fire them, and move forward as if it never happened. That's unfortunately what the government wants as well. Sadly, that would lead to it just happening again, and then pinning the blame on someone else.

ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH woman Dr. Bandy X Lee's assembling of 27 people writing words about the DANGER Donald Trump is to the nation October 3, 2017. But the only words that people care about is commenting words. The constant avoidance of nonfiction books printed on paper is there if you look at social media users and "No Kings" protests and ICE protest. People are avoidant of learning and always engaging exactly what Donald Trump provides: Mocking, insulting, anti-learning, anti-education, anti-Malala values. The *commenting about Trump* is all people learn any more, the latest patterns of insulting, joking, mockery. When Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon are the methods of communications that people think wins all debate, you get Donald Trump making videos about playing on the hockey team.

Because people care more about hating their "ex lover" and disappointing neighbor - they insisted to put the most terrible person up on television every day to be stimulated into having crowds form around lighted screens to discuss just how much hate is the most important thing to the future of the United States of America... and what we always dreamed up was having a machine in our hands to touch and spread hate all over the World Wide Web in the nae of waking up to beeps and vibrations that the future really needs to have more comments about how stupid and dumb one person is over and over. The population sold-out health care, education, healthy food... just so that machine held in the hand could deliver messages about a terrible person over and over in every variation and pattern imaginable.

Newspapers, magazines, newsletters, leaflets, postings, billboards, messages paid for by billionaires like Rupert Murdoch who has a global network of urgent message delivery. And, somehow, the consumers of media are convinced that the "dumb" "stupid" problem lies not with the audience. But that we need to *ban* and *block* television channels like Fox News. We should  not criticize the Reddit audience for putting MAGA hat photographs on the front page of Reddit in full color. Because no way would a man in Russia named "Surkov" have inspired a network of media systems to all behave the same way.

The audience who recognizes "Family Guy" animated show in Donald Trump's content says more about the audience than the POTUS Tony Clifton act that Trump is acting. If Trump is not great at economics, what is Trump's skill that puts him in the center of every media system in USA? if Trump is not good at diplomacy and trade agreements, then what exactly is the talent that Trump has in getting at the center of every conversation on Reddit for 3,906 days in a row? Does anyone remember that being a "socialite" and "influencer" on television, that being on Reality TV is the thing Donald Trump was popular January 8, 2004 on NBC? Just maybe, the problem is THE AUDIENCE, the fandom, that watches Family Guy...

Post Title:      Donald Trump’s 2024 election win increased the social acceptability of prejudice. Study reveals that groups targeted by Donald Trump during his campaign experienced an increase in both the perceived acceptability of prejudice and self-reported prejudice against them.

I met up with a few guys I used to hang out with in highschool, haven’t seen either since COVID and was looking foreward to catching up with them. We go to this one taco place that is incredible in my city and within three minutes of sitting down one of the guys says “ oh by the way we lately have been getting rather racist”. They said it like I would say lately I got into pickle ball. Like it was so normal and just a fun little tid bit. I obviously left and haven’t talked to them since, but the normalcy in acknowledging self bigotry is wild.

It's not just Trump. In 2008 when Obama won, all these bigots found each other on the Internet and once they realized they weren't alone they felt their BS was ok and then it started leaking out into the real world. Trump is just one of those people and when he won the presidency in 2016 the flood gates opened. I wouldn't even say that 2024 was worse. Just more of the same.

Race\-based hate crimes peaked in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and then started to trend downward. Then, coincidentally, right around the time in 2015 when Trump announced his intention to run for president, race\-based hate crimes took a sharp turn upwards and have been increasing ever since.

It’s important to note that not only did Trump win, he won the popular vote. If he had won due to gerrymandering or the electoral college, people would still go about their daily lives assuming that, more often than not, strangers would not approve of discrimination and hostility. But that’s not what happened.

Many people did not vote in the 2024 election because their vote ‘didn’t matter’ but if Trump had won despite being clearly unpopular with voters, we might have had a 2025 that was more like 2016\.

> "A torrent that began in 2014. I am so tired of lies." - YES, not 2016, but years before the election. Trumpism didn't just start after he took office in January 2017.

I think this is reductive. Yeah, there’s a ton of corruption and duplicity in the Mexican government. Saying that if the country wanted to wipe out the cartels, it would, is really kind of BS. Cartels survive because of a bunch of factors but not the least of which is a jaw\-dropping amount of money from outside the country and systemic issues that Mexico has been dealing with since independence and throughout the 20th century. That’s like saying if the US wanted to deal with its racism issues, it would. It’s never that simple.

And can't let them see the connection between them being in control and everything sucking. As long as they can blame the left for the problems and make up stories about how the liberals are causing problems, the republican voters will keep pouring votes and money into their party. 

And somehow democrat voters believe that the dem officials are liberal and if we can get enough of them in they will make changes. Despite that being disproven every time they get power. They are centerist at best. They find ways to blame conservatives for problems and make little changes to look tough then they bow to their corporate donors and beg for handouts.

They love to act like the underdog victims

The biggest evidence of this is referring to any news channel that isn't Fox News as the "mainstream media", which paints themselves as the little underdog fighting against the mainstream. 

The most popular news channel by viewership for YEARS has been Fox News...... so by definition Fox News, their news channel, IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA

Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017 being ignored and avoided by the Reddit community, Bluesky community... I am calling out over and over and over on this GitHub project.

The bewildering Tony Clifton performance is what has attracted the fandom to Trump all along since June 16, 2015. More than a decade of people prizing Trump messages and videos as a source of amusement and comedy. The best Tony Clifton character performer in history. Gullible audience thinks that what we need is FICTION_HARDER - that we need NONSENSE_HARDER cries for more and more Trump family content to comment about. Cult of ignorance. Celebrating the ignorance source and ignorance leadership Trump provides.

When you approach a medieval town, the cathedral is the tallest thing in the place. When you approach an eighteenth-century town, it is the political palace that’s the tallest thing in the place.

In fact, given this postmodern world any one of the four could emerge with the biggest one fourth depending on how they ran their campaign. Probably it would depend on who could hire David Gergen. I mean, if Fidel got to Gergen first, he might win the damn thing, we don’t know.

Thats the thing, it isn’t nonsensical when you look at the whole picture. These groups of people are surrounded by a viewpoint, in radio, tv, social media. This viewpoint defines their social identity. They are trying to conform with where they think this identity puts them, it is easier to deny facts or reality than who they think they are.

Post Title:      Pentagon sets Friday deadline for Anthropic to abandon ethics rules for AI — or else  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
Anthropic is refusing to allow their AI make final targeting decisions without human input or be used for mass domestic surveillance.

The Pentagon threatened to blacklist Anthropic from federal contracts and use the Defense Production Act to to continue using their technology anyway.

> CONSERVING_WHAT one thing I note about American "conservative" leadership, there never is any concern about conserving technology. Conservative Neil Postman of NYC ignored again and again. The Amish I grew up with and worked next to in Grabill, Indiana actually understood "conservative".  Technology worship, weapon systems worship, GUN_WORSHIP systems of thinking is cult behavior in USA.

It's billionaires and weird religious psychos. Trump will die and they'll make a new one.

If Trump is dangerous, why is it that Bluesky and Reddit end-users are consistently avoiding Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership? Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee not being quoted constantly over and over in Reddit comments. ANSWER: because nonfiction serious books are avoided. The cult is of memes and images.
