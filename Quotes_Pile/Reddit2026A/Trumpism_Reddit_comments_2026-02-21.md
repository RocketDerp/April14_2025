"They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

Another gullible Reddit user. A person thinks the government of Russia and USA are just accidentally making public scenes and creating media content for the Reddit front page. Reddit cult members do not have the cult education to recognize they are in a media consumption cult. Reddit users can't imagine comedy "The Onion" being used against the audience to trigger reactionary mindsets of name-calling the authorities as stupid and dumb via media systems.

Abuse of children is what the EPSTEIN_FANDOM desires. it gets media coverage, stimulating media content for media cults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/LetsDiscussThis/comments/1rar6r9/next_up/o6lms9o/

The POSTING itself is titled, has a cult image of Donald Trump / photograph of Trump, and asks "When will America get serious about our pedophile president issue?" (again, in the posting itself, not this comment). So the Reddit user is asserting people are not serious, with an extreme short-length generic clickbait title posting of "Next Up", two words, that in no way convey the topic or subject.

As for the comment: GIVE_UP_SURRENDER to the Reddit audience. Stay inside your boxed thinking patterns, inside the box of Reddit commenting. Observe the avoidance of nonfiction teaching for the general public. Absence of Dr. Bandy X Lee book quotes, etc.

ROUTINE_COMMENTING_DESCRIBING_IS_NOT_INTELLECTUALLY_RESISTING the Surkovian techniques are not called out by name on Reddit, as nonfiction about serious and relevant topics is avoided.

Top-down programming of their mindsets).

* "The **successful** sociopath’s predatory “empathy” reflects a definite perceptive acumen, making him a genius at manipulation. When this works, it produces a disastrous trust in him. Yet, like the tiger, he is unconcerned about the welfare of his target. The pathological emotional problems in sociopathy make one another worse. An inability to have a consistent realistic view of the world, or to maintain emotionally genuine relationships, leads to more paranoia. The weakness in impulse control which arises from enraged reactions to imagined slights and produces reckless, destructive behavior, leads to a greater need to deny criticism with more lies to tell oneself and everyone else, and an increasing distance from reality. The more a sociopath needs to scapegoat others the more he genuinely hates them, **making him even more aggressive and sadistic. Life is devoted to endless destruction in the service of an endless quest for power and admiration**, unmitigated by basic empathy or guilt." ― Bandy X Lee, [The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

CALL_FOR_ACTION_TO_DO_TRIVIAL_CHANGE This Reddit user is encouraging the Trump-content cult members on Reddit to make a trivial media-content change. To change the name of a prop in the Reality TV White House Kremlin show. The fandom does not call to arms for Dr. Bandy X Lee's mental health public education. Instead the fandom calls for screenplay changes, the name of a character. No call to REMOVE the tariffs, just to give them a different name for the audience on Reddit. This is what an engaged fandom does, this is Reddit behavior. This is fans in a crowd crying out to the performer on stage to change a line in the show! Glued to their Reddit device screens.

1. Why is there no Reddit blackout calling for Trump removal?

2. 2hy is social media not being used to organize FAQ and Wiki of the badness of Trump / MAGA?

3. Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction education for the general public not being quoted constantly over and over on Reddit and Blueksy? Why are people not following a woman leader who assembled 27 contributors to a nonfiction book on paper?

4. Why is it that Jen Senko's 2015 film (and later book) about brainwashing of right-wing media not discussed all the time and frequently on Reddit commenting sections?

ANSWER: Reddit is a cult of media events. a "RIOT" is a media event with action and ICE-like violence. Why is it that Reddit brainwashed people can't discuss Jen Senko's brainwashing media ecology film... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad Because the self-awareness of how billionaires have programmed Reddit audience into predictable reactions is too painful.

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re **no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken**. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241.

* "We believe that we can help answer these questions by emphasizing that the two propositions are not mutually exclusive. **A man can be both evil and mentally compromised — which is a more frightening proposition. Power not only corrupts but also magnifies existing psychopathologies**, even as it creates new ones. Fostered by the flattery of underlings and the chants of crowds, a political leader’s grandiosity may morph into grotesque delusions of grandeur. Sociopathic traits may be amplified as the leader discovers that he can violate the norms of civil society and even commit crimes with impunity. And the leader who rules through fear, lies, and betrayal may become increasingly isolated and paranoid, as the loyalty of even his closest confidants must forever be suspect." ― Bandy X.
