"They see no accountability in the adults in charge" - COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING Reddit adults are fixated on those "in charge". We The People are the source of power in a democracy. This is no longer comprehended and understood, that the very people watching this video on Reddit are the source and foundation of power. Why is REDDIT society not having a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest? Why is Reddit community not constantly quoting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book and repeating it in every comment? Why is nonfiction serious sources of adult education avoided on Reddit hour after, hour, day after day, in favor of low-effort commenting about the police, MAGA, ICE, Trump, etc? ANSWER: Adults are addicted to the commenting about the situation using touch media devices. Adults are not teaching adults nonfiction relevant emergency topics. Low-importance comments are drowning out urgently needed rescue education. INFORMATION_GLUT_COMMENTING_GLUT

Another gullible Reddit user. A person thinks the government of Russia and USA are just accidentally making public scenes and creating media content for the Reddit front page. Reddit cult members do not have the cult education to recognize they are in a media consumption cult. Reddit users can't imagine comedy "The Onion" being used against the audience to trigger reactionary mindsets of name-calling the authorities as stupid and dumb via media systems.
