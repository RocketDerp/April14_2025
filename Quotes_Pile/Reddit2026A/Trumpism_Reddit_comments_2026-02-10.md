Most upvoted (popular) comment. Assume Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin programming of media cults is to mock. Short-length Twitter-style commenting. The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

This whole posting title is bullshit. The comment may be factual, but the post title is simulation of resistance. Fiction reality of The Bible does indeed trump over real science reality.

Reddit audience is a cult of MAGA, cult of Trump, cult of billionaire media stunts. The Reddit cult is a hate-watching cult club. It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers. "Early online hate-watching communities emerged with sites like Television Without Pity in 1998, which gleefully criticised every new episode of the teen series Dawson's Creek. In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

If you **truly want to understand what is going on in USA** since year 2013, study this behavior on Reddit. DELIGHTED people to have hate in their life. To have high-speed TCP/IP media system to express how much they love and are delighted following the Putin + Trump hate leadership. We The People are the followers of hate. We The People prize hate, to seek out MAGA and USA audiences to hate. Hate vs. hate fandoms, Super Bowl team sports sport-mentality thinking of hate vs. hate as the ideal version of governing. You have to take the media ecology addiction to hate seriously, study the Middle East.

**The 1954 Equation**

Sunday, February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

“At the front door I pat my trouser pocket to check for the thin outline of my passport and realize it’s not there. Always the passport, always the “dokumenti!” **You can get stopped and checked for papers at any moment**. It might only actually happen once or maybe even twice a year, but you still have to stand in queues and knock on doors to obtain the whole library of little stamps, regulations, permits — the legal stipulations and requirements that are themselves always changing. A little trick to keep you always on tenterhooks, always patting your pockets for your papers, always waking up worried that you might have lost them in a bar. Over time you begin to pat for the passport instinctively, your hand going down unthinkingly to check your pocket so many times a day you don’t even notice any more. That’s true power — when it starts to influence the unconscious movements of your arms.”

Surely spending free time and spare time commenting on Trump without bringing up mental health professionals, quotes from 27 authors, from Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book on... social media commenting... is important since October 3, 2017. Why isn't this the most discussed serious book on social media? Why is everyone commenting day after day, year after year, decade after decade about Donald Trump and avoiding recommending and teaching the general public from a nonfiction book...

* "Therapists of mental health across the country report having to expand their practices to include what is being called “election trauma.” “What I’m seeing with my clients, particularly with women who experienced sexual abuse when younger, is that they are being re-wounded, re-traumatized,” said Atlanta licensed professional counselor Susan Blank. “They can’t escape it. It’s all around them, written large on the national stage” (LaMotte 2016). Among the many truly disturbing behaviors of this man now serving as the leader of the free world is his relationship to his daughter Ivanka." ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

And the Middle East is a role model for love and compassion in USA. Hate vs. hate clergy teachings. Out-group mocking and out-group hate are foundations of Levant clergy leadership and popularity.  Democracy does not work without "love thy neighbor", "love thy enemy". Nonfiction book, "The Power of Myth", published year 1988:

CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. **They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what the **Great Seal** is all about.

The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.

Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, **by politics**, by history, **by truth**, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is **totalitarian technocracy**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

* “Whenever I ask my Russian bosses, the older TV producers and media types who run the system, what it was like growing up in the late Soviet Union, whether they believed in the Communist ideology that surrounded them, they always laugh at me.   
“Don’t be silly,” most answer.   
“But you sang the songs? Were good members of the Komsomol?”   
“Of course we did, and we felt good when we sang them. And then straight after we would listen to ‘Deep Purple’ and the BBC.”   
“So you were dissidents? You believed in finishing the USSR?”   
“No. It’s not like that. You just speak several languages at the same time, all the time. There’s like several ‘you’s.”  
Seen from this perspective, the great drama of Russia is not the “transition” between communism and capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that during the final decades of the USSR no one believed in communism and yet carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of simulations. For this remains the common, everyday psychology: the **Ostankino producers who make news worshiping the President** in the day and then switch on an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists who morph from role to role with liquid ease—a nationalist autocrat one moment and a liberal aesthete the next; the “orthodox” oligarchs who sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism—and keep their money and families in London. All cultures have differences between “public” and “private” selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be quite extreme.”

What abut the cults of people who are so attracted to Trump? People who want to follow leadership of badness? The hundreds of millions of people who think it is entertaining to have all media systems constantly sharing Trump's image like this posting om Reddit. Media consumption cults.'

Twitter-length. No off-Reddit URL. Top-upvoted popular comment. No quotes from any authors / books / author names. It is commenting addiction about MAGA that runs society now. People are not taking terrorism as a serious intellectual topic. 

The screen shot is asking the right questions. Having lived in Algeria and intimately involved in the terrorism mental conditioning of family... this is EXACTLY the OPENING of very important and critical questions (in the screen shot). But, alas, people in USA are making the same mistake as they did after September 11, 2001. Getting GUNS ready and cheering on "liberals get guns too!!!".

There is so much liberals vs conservative brain-rot. BOTH worshiping guns is bad. Where are the peace lovers who want to use Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's words and TEACHING and EDUCATING and PREACHING (too preachy) to address terrorism! Malala is giving up, not that I say she didn't do her tour of duty and also do long-term changes - but Malala's latest book and book tour is making it clear that she is not going to be doing what Greta Thunberg is doing. And fine, I think Malala's year 2013 book captures several authors and what needs to be said. If ANYTHING, I would fault Malala for not pointing to  Elif Şafak and her library of public lectures, writing, etc. If Malala wants to be into popular sports, fashion, a celebrity - so be it. Again, her speeches and lectures and writings from January 3, 2009 to year 2014 stand. Capturing that youth into time travel writing.

Personally for me, the crisis is far more extreme and Greta Thunberg is intellectually uppity in the way we all need to be (minus the physical antics, I don't encourage, we need a THINKING revolution. Not Trump-style antics politics). Alas, I'm too exhausted to explain better. But we don't need 5,000 Greta Thunberg - we need billions of EVERYDAY people quoting: Dr. Bandy X Lee, quoting Malala, quoting Greta's 2019 book, quoting Banksy's book, quoting Elif Şafak. Teaching what these have to say. And there are more out there to quote and teach... but I can only keep so many in my head as examples! Peter Pomerantsev too!

The CRISIS of OUR TIME is people not getting on the same page! And GOOD pages. We are all on the same page of mocking Musk and Mocking Trump and Mocking Putin! We need to get off the mocking pages and into the serious comprehension pages. Pomerantsev... Dr. Bandy X Lee... Elif Şafak ... Malala's year 2013 speeches, interviews and book!

That's why I keep emphasizing the spare-time free-time on Reddit where people are NOT quoting and teaching Dr. Bandy X Lee. How people avoid Jen Senko's film and book. People are NOT asserting goodness. People are NOT doing cult deprogramming. People are NOT facing up to the Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency outcomes since year 2013. We need to spiritually heal as a nation through education and teaching. Media ecology self-awareness. Just saying "cult", "cray" is not enough. Jen Senko and Dr. Bandy X Lee are leaders that are on the table, at the public library, and one URL clock away... that we are not facing up to.

People in USA can not see they are 0.34 billion out of over 8 billion people. In an ISLAMIC nation, where I lived in Algeria, when a Muslim man does terrorism it's the same thing! It is when it happens in ANOTHER nation by Israel against Palestine people are far more upset. When terrorism is "one of your own" - Russian Putin harming Russian people... it's often treated entirely different than when it is an immigrant or different religion, etc.

That is why Campbell said in 1986/1987 that the Levant faith systems have DISQUALIFIED themselves for the future. "they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future."

We, USA society, learned nothing from September 11, 2001. We did not study Mecca, we did not study the Quran, we did not study the clergy of the Mosque. And October 7, 2023 was another reminder. We did not listen to Malala when she came to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's church. A Muslim woman from Pakistan, which is way way way far away from both the Middle East and USA - came to Atalanta, Georgia and gave a speech in a Christian Church. A MUSLIM WOMAN gave a speech in a CHURCH! WHILE TRUMP was POTUS! Why the fuck do people not cheer on goodness itself!

Trumpism. Trump fandom on Reddit. MAGA-writing. Trump-language. This is what White House says "radical x-wing terrorists", and Reddit messaging is repeating what the billionaire media systems tell people to parrot and repeat. ["You might have come across the articles (“I Lost My Dad to Fox News” / “Lost Someone to Fox News?” / “‘Fox News Brain’: Meet the Families Torn Apart by Toxic Cable News”), or the Reddit threads, or the support groups on Facebook, as people have sought ways to mourn loved ones who are still alive. The discussions consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one. At this point, some Americans speak English; others speak Fox."](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/)

"bad people". The idea that there are "good people" and "bad people" instead of bad ideas and and bad information and bad behaviors. People are complex.

In what way does this man benefit from murder of his daughter? How is his life better for having killed a 23 year old woman? I don't believe for one minute that he has improved his life or improved the world at large. It is an error, it is a mistake, and likely PROGRAMMED INTO HIS BRAIN to seek out guns to worship. Seek out Fox News HDTV and Newsmax HDTV and Trump HDTV to worship. Billionaires have manipulated him into gun worship, hate and dehumanization. Texas United States of America is a TOXIC society a TOXIC culture that he swims in. He swims in an ocean of billionaire media systems USA February 2026. It is a BAD SOCIETY with SPECIFIC BAD VALUES I HAVE NAMED: Gun worship, Billionaire worship!

What's simple: simple-thinking simple-message short-length commenting on Reddit. 

* "you could legitimately expect people to write if they still read or wrote. Not many people still do either – read or write, much – but in any case; **reduction of complexity**. Let’s look at political parties for a moment. The Republicans with their great traditions have come up with a slogan of incredible sophistication: “No more tax and spend”. Now any you who can quack that one out could be a Republican. And I am using that **in the Orwellian sense of “quack”; you don’t need to engage higher brain functions**. All you have to do is say “Don’t take my money, and don’t spend it… well, except on me and my friends, but don’t tax and spend”. Now it’s not that the Democrats are doing any better, I don’t guess that’s news. I mean, Clinton is now less popular than Castro. If Castro ran against Clinton, Clinton would lose by a few points. I mean, he wouldn’t lose big, but he would lose, you know, by a few points. I mean, especially in a three person race with Clinton, Castro, Perot and Gaddafi. I mean, I don’t know who would win. In fact, given this postmodern world any one of the four could emerge with the biggest one fourth depending on how they ran their campaign. Probably it would depend on who could hire David Gergen \[crowd laughter\]. I mean, if Fidel got to Gergen first, he might win the damn thing, we don’t know. But the Democrat’s response to this “tax and spend” is “No we don’t, nah nah na-nah nah: invest” **This is political debate in a democracy. No it’s not. It’s the simulation of politics**." - Texan Rick Roderick

Yes. Comparative mythology is essential studies. People live in such filter-bubbles they don't see that supporting Malala in year 2013 and year 2014 is supporting women girls in Texas too. People are so fixated on national flags, languages, sports teams of their city that they can not see common-ground issues of parenting, marriage, childhood that Malala was raising on her WWW blog January 3, 2009.

Exactly how is the coverage "misleading"? The comment is anti-informative. Is this a practiced social media engagement technique? Non-details.

The low-effort short-length commenting on Reddit is nothing new. "both sides", as if all topics of parenting are "two sides". Like the Texas Clergy teaches; there is a good team and an evil team, decide if you are going to follow Jesus or Satan, take your pick! There are two sides! Evil or good, both are valid creations by God above! This one-bit TWO AND ONLY TWO logic is incredibly popular with cloud computing Reddit fandoms.

28 day Reddit account. with a SHIT Reddit shit-posting headline of "To not be in a cult" - the constant "cult" claim on Reddit that never actually turns to **cult deprogramming** and mental health professionals that Dr. Bandy X Lee has organized. But no, "cult" is just shit-talking street-gang sign to insult and mock, not something to rescue Texas people from. Just a way to *look down* and *punch down* on Texas people that have been manipulated by powerful billionaire Rupert Murdoch into a cult of media Fox News HDTV. The Reddit comment complains about "the media" headline when Reddit media headline is total trash-talk shit-posting media. Reddit cult of shit-posting to serious topics needs to be rescued!

Reddit commenting fandom is literally joking and mocking the out-group in patterns conditioned by billionaire information systems owners and programmers. As programmed by billionaire leaders. Texas is a joke, Reddit commenting is joke-washing mill. Minds are blown into joking about serious problems instead of actually helping people using education and teaching in a serious positive way.

5 month Reddit account. The comments about the wine drinking. The gun is being a source of entertainment and "show and tell" and even POINTED at a human person, while LOADED. There is no defense of any kind, pointing a loaded gun at a person is an OFFENSIVE action, not home defense. Bullets do not simply jump into a gun. A gun doesn't have any useful purpose in the house. These actions are not like accidentally poisoning someone with bad food... the food has a purpose other than killing a person. A gun doesn't have a purpose other than to kill and intimidate people!

**The 1954 Equation**

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.
