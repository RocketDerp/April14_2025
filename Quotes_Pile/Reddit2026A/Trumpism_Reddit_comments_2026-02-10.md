Most upvoted (popular) comment. Assume Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin programming of media cults is to mock. Short-length Twitter-style commenting. The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

A long-form detailed off-Reddit citation comment! There needs to be a Wiki and FAQ compilation of topics, with focus on priority (this is not a high-priority concern, it is engagement content for Trump information fandoms)

This whole posting title is bullshit. The comment may be factual, but the post title is simulation of resistance. Fiction reality of The Bible does indeed trump over real science reality. Fox News HDTV fiction rules over our most important real problems. Kid Rock is not an important fucking subject. Fox News HDTV anti-reality is wrecking USA 24 hours a day.

But if we don’t practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the **truly serious problems that face us and we** risk becoming a nation of suckers" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 38

And remember: Rural people do not have education from New York City. New York University. Manhattan Professor Neil Postman. And study Reddit commenting, a cult of avoiding nonfiction. Reddit is a cult of MAGA / ICE / Trump / Musk hate-watching. Study hard on the Reddit comments, observe the lack of concern to rescue USA and NATO from the mental manipulation Trump and Putin have done. AVOIDED: { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev } nonfiction.
