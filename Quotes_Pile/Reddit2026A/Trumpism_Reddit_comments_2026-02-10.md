Most upvoted (popular) comment. Assume Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin programming of media cults is to mock. Short-length Twitter-style commenting. The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

This whole posting title is bullshit. The comment may be factual, but the post title is simulation of resistance. Fiction reality of The Bible does indeed trump over real science reality. Fox News HDTV fiction rules over our most important real problems. Kid Rock is not an important fucking subject. Fox News HDTV anti-reality is wrecking USA 24 hours a day.

Reddit audience is a cult of MAGA, cult of Trump, cult of billionaire media stunts. The Reddit cult is a hate-watching cult club. It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers. "Early online hate-watching communities emerged with sites like Television Without Pity in 1998, which gleefully criticised every new episode of the teen series Dawson's Creek. In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

If you **truly want to understand what is going on in USA** since year 2013, study this behavior on Reddit. DELIGHTED people to have hate in their life. To have high-speed TCP/IP media system to express how much they love and are delighted following the Putin + Trump hate leadership. We The People are the followers of hate. We The People prize hate, to seek out MAGA and USA audiences to hate. Hate vs. hate fandoms, Super Bowl team sports sport-mentality thinking of hate vs. hate as the ideal version of governing. You have to take the media ecology addiction to hate seriously, study the Middle East. I moved to Amman, Jordan during the Arab Spring Syria War outbreak in March 2011 to study media ecology of *hate for hate* fandoms. *Hate harder* competitive hate faith of Reddit users. Surkov won since March of year 2013.

**The 1954 Equation**

Sunday, February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

“At the front door I pat my trouser pocket to check for the thin outline of my passport and realize it’s not there. Always the passport, always the “dokumenti!” **You can get stopped and checked for papers at any moment**. It might only actually happen once or maybe even twice a year, but you still have to stand in queues and knock on doors to obtain the whole library of little stamps, regulations, permits — the legal stipulations and requirements that are themselves always changing. A little trick to keep you always on tenterhooks, always patting your pockets for your papers, always waking up worried that you might have lost them in a bar. Over time you begin to pat for the passport instinctively, your hand going down unthinkingly to check your pocket so many times a day you don’t even notice any more. That’s true power — when it starts to influence the unconscious movements of your arms.”

Before modern medicine, that's the way white European life was. Before ambulance, 911 phone service, airlift to hospitals. Parents had many children and morality rate was higher. Even pets are often allowed to breed freely, and farms can become overrun with cats and dogs that have not had surgery to prevent reproduction. This is a cult behavior that does not put human compassion but addiction to power leaders and mechanical gun devices. Sacrifices to the God Trump, God Jesus age 80 father figure.

Surely spending free time and spare time commenting on Trump without bringing up mental health professionals, quotes from 27 authors, from Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book on... social media commenting... is important since October 3, 2017. Why isn't this the most discussed serious book on social media? Why is everyone commenting day after day, year after year, decade after decade about Donald Trump and avoiding recommending and teaching the general public from a nonfiction book...

* "Therapists of mental health across the country report having to expand their practices to include what is being called “election trauma.” “What I’m seeing with my clients, particularly with women who experienced sexual abuse when younger, is that they are being re-wounded, re-traumatized,” said Atlanta licensed professional counselor Susan Blank. “They can’t escape it. It’s all around them, written large on the national stage” (LaMotte 2016). Among the many truly disturbing behaviors of this man now serving as the leader of the free world is his relationship to his daughter Ivanka." ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

And the Middle East is a role model for love and compassion in USA. Hate vs. hate clergy teachings. Out-group mocking and out-group hate are foundations of Levant clergy leadership and popularity.  Democracy does not work without "love thy neighbor", "love thy enemy". Nonfiction book, "The Power of Myth", published year 1988:

CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. **They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what the **Great Seal** is all about.

Cheering on failure of media education and failure to resist billionaire cult programming systems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching People on Reddit so thrilled to see Russia's Putin mind-fuck other people into self-harm via social media systems. Rupert Murdoch and Elon Musk programming people with Kremlin manipulation to prize out-group hate. And Reddit is doing the same patterns of out-group hate. The whole nation is sinking on the world stage because nobody wants to break the chain of hate and no leaders are calling out that hate itself is badness.

* "Somewhere somebody must have some sense. Men must see that force begets force, hate begets hate, toughness begets toughness. And it is all a descending spiral, ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody. Somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe. And you do that by love." - Montgomery, Alabama (17 November 1957)

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241.
