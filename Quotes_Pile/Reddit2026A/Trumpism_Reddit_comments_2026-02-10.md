Most upvoted (popular) comment. Assume Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin programming of media cults is to mock. Short-length Twitter-style commenting. The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

A long-form detailed off-Reddit citation comment! There needs to be a Wiki and FAQ compilation of topics, with focus on priority (this is not a high-priority concern, it is engagement content for Trump information fandoms)

This whole posting title is bullshit. The comment may be factual, but the post title is simulation of resistance. Fiction reality of The Bible does indeed trump over real science reality. Fox News HDTV fiction rules over our most important real problems. Kid Rock is not an important fucking subject. Fox News HDTV anti-reality is wrecking USA 24 hours a day.

And remember: Rural people do not have education from New York City. New York University. Manhattan Professor Neil Postman. And study Reddit commenting, a cult of avoiding nonfiction. Reddit is a cult of MAGA / ICE / Trump / Musk hate-watching. Study hard on the Reddit comments, observe the lack of concern to rescue USA and NATO from the mental manipulation Trump and Putin have done. AVOIDED: { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev } nonfiction.

The problem of Reddit society is that people are avoiding FAQ creation, Wiki creation, off-Reddit linking to stable information, nonfiction books on paper. Reddit is a cult community of low-effort commenting to avoid organizing the most critical and important information. AVOIDED: { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev } nonfiction.

Reddit audience is a cult of MAGA, cult of Trump, cult of billionaire media stunts. The Reddit cult is a hate-watching cult club. It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers. "Early online hate-watching communities emerged with sites like Television Without Pity in 1998, which gleefully criticised every new episode of the teen series Dawson's Creek. In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

Bring back a revival of older music that has been drowned out in Truth Social noise and static. Create an Opera of revival, including Dixie Chicks.

OPERA_A This song has even deeper roots, but the cover video and pregnancy visual themes are so great. Great Seal USA growing plants (front side of the pyramid on the Nile river in Africa) visual metaphors... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4_wXPZ1Bnk 36,051,568 views September 27, 2010 When I was teaching the meaning of the Great Seal to women in North Africa over the Internet after Ramadan 2010 - I shared this excellent video!

**Hate-based Economy**, ecology and economy of **out-group hate** media values and mindsets.  

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.
