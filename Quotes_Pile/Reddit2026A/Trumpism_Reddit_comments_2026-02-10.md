Most upvoted (popular) comment. Assume Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin programming of media cults is to mock. Short-length Twitter-style commenting. The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

This whole posting title is bullshit. The comment may be factual, but the post title is simulation of resistance. Fiction reality of The Bible does indeed trump over real science reality.

Reddit audience is a cult of MAGA, cult of Trump, cult of billionaire media stunts. The Reddit cult is a hate-watching cult club. It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers. "Early online hate-watching communities emerged with sites like Television Without Pity in 1998, which gleefully criticised every new episode of the teen series Dawson's Creek. In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

If you **truly want to understand what is going on in USA** since year 2013, study this behavior on Reddit. DELIGHTED people to have hate in their life. To have high-speed TCP/IP media system to express how much they love and are delighted following the Putin + Trump hate leadership. We The People are the followers of hate. We The People prize hate, to seek out MAGA and USA audiences to hate. Hate vs. hate fandoms, Super Bowl team sports sport-mentality thinking of hate vs. hate as the ideal version of governing. You have to take the media ecology addiction to hate seriously, study the Middle East.

**The 1954 Equation**

Sunday, February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

“At the front door I pat my trouser pocket to check for the thin outline of my passport and realize it’s not there. Always the passport, always the “dokumenti!” **You can get stopped and checked for papers at any moment**. It might only actually happen once or maybe even twice a year, but you still have to stand in queues and knock on doors to obtain the whole library of little stamps, regulations, permits — the legal stipulations and requirements that are themselves always changing. A little trick to keep you always on tenterhooks, always patting your pockets for your papers, always waking up worried that you might have lost them in a bar. Over time you begin to pat for the passport instinctively, your hand going down unthinkingly to check your pocket so many times a day you don’t even notice any more. That’s true power — when it starts to influence the unconscious movements of your arms.”

Surely spending free time and spare time commenting on Trump without bringing up mental health professionals, quotes from 27 authors, from Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book on... social media commenting... is important since October 3, 2017. Why isn't this the most discussed serious book on social media? Why is everyone commenting day after day, year after year, decade after decade about Donald Trump and avoiding recommending and teaching the general public from a nonfiction book...

* "Therapists of mental health across the country report having to expand their practices to include what is being called “election trauma.” “What I’m seeing with my clients, particularly with women who experienced sexual abuse when younger, is that they are being re-wounded, re-traumatized,” said Atlanta licensed professional counselor Susan Blank. “They can’t escape it. It’s all around them, written large on the national stage” (LaMotte 2016). Among the many truly disturbing behaviors of this man now serving as the leader of the free world is his relationship to his daughter Ivanka." ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

And the Middle East is a role model for love and compassion in USA. Hate vs. hate clergy teachings. Out-group mocking and out-group hate are foundations of Levant clergy leadership and popularity.  Democracy does not work without "love thy neighbor", "love thy enemy". Nonfiction book, "The Power of Myth", published year 1988:

CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In biblical thinking, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. **They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That’s what the **Great Seal** is all about.

The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.

Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, **by politics**, by history, **by truth**, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is **totalitarian technocracy**.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE).

* “Whenever I ask my Russian bosses, the older TV producers and media types who run the system, what it was like growing up in the late Soviet Union, whether they believed in the Communist ideology that surrounded them, they always laugh at me.   
“Don’t be silly,” most answer.   
“But you sang the songs? Were good members of the Komsomol?”   
“Of course we did, and we felt good when we sang them. And then straight after we would listen to ‘Deep Purple’ and the BBC.”   
“So you were dissidents? You believed in finishing the USSR?”   
“No. It’s not like that. You just speak several languages at the same time, all the time. There’s like several ‘you’s.”  
Seen from this perspective, the great drama of Russia is not the “transition” between communism and capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that during the final decades of the USSR no one believed in communism and yet carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of simulations. For this remains the common, everyday psychology: the **Ostankino producers who make news worshiping the President** in the day and then switch on an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists who morph from role to role with liquid ease—a nationalist autocrat one moment and a liberal aesthete the next; the “orthodox” oligarchs who sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism—and keep their money and families in London. All cultures have differences between “public” and “private” selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be quite extreme.”

Twitter-length. No off-Reddit URL. Top-upvoted popular comment. No quotes from any authors / books / author names. It is commenting addiction about MAGA that runs society now. People are not taking terrorism as a serious intellectual topic. 

The screen shot is asking the right questions. Having lived in Algeria and intimately involved in the terrorism mental conditioning of family... this is EXACTLY the OPENING of very important and critical questions (in the screen shot). But, alas, people in USA are making the same mistake as they did after September 11, 2001. Getting GUNS ready and cheering on "liberals get guns too!!!".

There is so much liberals vs conservative brain-rot. BOTH worshiping guns is bad. Where are the peace lovers who want to use Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's words and TEACHING and EDUCATING and PREACHING (too preachy) to address terrorism! Malala is giving up, not that I say she didn't do her tour of duty and also do long-term changes - but Malala's latest book and book tour is making it clear that she is not going to be doing what Greta Thunberg is doing. And fine, I think Malala's year 2013 book captures several authors and what needs to be said. If ANYTHING, I would fault Malala for not pointing to  Elif Şafak and her library of public lectures, writing, etc. If Malala wants to be into popular sports, fashion, a celebrity - so be it. Again, her speeches and lectures and writings from January 3, 2009 to year 2014 stand. Capturing that youth into time travel writing.

Personally for me, the crisis is far more extreme and Greta Thunberg is intellectually uppity in the way we all need to be (minus the physical antics, I don't encourage, we need a THINKING revolution. Not Trump-style antics politics). Alas, I'm too exhausted to explain better. But we don't need 5,000 Greta Thunberg - we need billions of EVERYDAY people quoting: Dr. Bandy X Lee, quoting Malala, quoting Greta's 2019 book, quoting Banksy's book, quoting Elif Şafak. Teaching what these have to say. And there are more out there to quote and teach... but I can only keep so many in my head as examples! Peter Pomerantsev too!

The CRISIS of OUR TIME is people not getting on the same page! And GOOD pages. We are all on the same page of mocking Musk and Mocking Trump and Mocking Putin! We need to get off the mocking pages and into the serious comprehension pages. Pomerantsev... Dr. Bandy X Lee... Elif Şafak ... Malala's year 2013 speeches, interviews and book!

That's why I keep emphasizing the spare-time free-time on Reddit where people are NOT quoting and teaching Dr. Bandy X Lee. How people avoid Jen Senko's film and book. People are NOT asserting goodness. People are NOT doing cult deprogramming. People are NOT facing up to the Cambridge Analytica and Internet Research Agency outcomes since year 2013. We need to spiritually heal as a nation through education and teaching. Media ecology self-awareness. Just saying "cult", "cray" is not enough. Jen Senko and Dr. Bandy X Lee are leaders that are on the table, at the public library, and one URL clock away... that we are not facing up to.

People in USA can not see they are 0.34 billion out of over 8 billion people. In an ISLAMIC nation, where I lived in Algeria, when a Muslim man does terrorism it's the same thing! It is when it happens in ANOTHER nation by Israel against Palestine people are far more upset. When terrorism is "one of your own" - Russian Putin harming Russian people... it's often treated entirely different than when it is an immigrant or different religion, etc.

That is why Campbell said in 1986/1987 that the Levant faith systems have DISQUALIFIED themselves for the future. "they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. They have disqualified themselves for the future."

We, USA society, learned nothing from September 11, 2001. We did not study Mecca, we did not study the Quran, we did not study the clergy of the Mosque. And October 7, 2023 was another reminder. We did not listen to Malala when she came to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's church. A Muslim woman from Pakistan, which is way way way far away from both the Middle East and USA - came to Atalanta, Georgia and gave a speech in a Christian Church. A MUSLIM WOMAN gave a speech in a CHURCH! WHILE TRUMP was POTUS! Why the fuck do people not cheer on goodness itself!

Trumpism. Trump fandom on Reddit. MAGA-writing. Trump-language. This is what White House says "radical x-wing terrorists", and Reddit messaging is repeating what the billionaire media systems tell people to parrot and repeat. ["You might have come across the articles (“I Lost My Dad to Fox News” / “Lost Someone to Fox News?” / “‘Fox News Brain’: Meet the Families Torn Apart by Toxic Cable News”), or the Reddit threads, or the support groups on Facebook, as people have sought ways to mourn loved ones who are still alive. The discussions consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one.

I don't believe for one minute that he has improved his life or improved the world at large. It is an error, it is a mistake, and likely PROGRAMMED INTO HIS BRAIN to seek out guns to worship.

What's simple: simple-thinking simple-message short-length commenting on Reddit. 

* "you could legitimately expect people to write if they still read or wrote. Not many people still do either – read or write, much – but in any case; **reduction of complexity**. Let’s look at political parties for a moment. The Republicans with their great traditions have come up with a slogan of incredible sophistication: “No more tax and spend”. Now any you who can quack that one out could be a Republican. And I am using that **in the Orwellian sense of “quack”; you don’t need to engage higher brain functions**. All you have to do is say “Don’t take my money, and don’t spend it… well, except on me and my friends, but don’t tax and spend”. Now it’s not that the Democrats are doing any better, I don’t guess that’s news. I mean, Clinton is now less popular than Castro. If Castro ran against Clinton, Clinton would lose by a few points. I mean, he wouldn’t lose big, but he would lose, you know, by a few points. I mean, especially in a three person race with Clinton, Castro, Perot and Gaddafi. I mean, I don’t know who would win. In fact, given this postmodern world any one of the four could emerge with the biggest one fourth depending on how they ran their campaign. Probably it would depend on who could hire David Gergen \[crowd laughter\]. I mean, if Fidel got to Gergen first, he might win the damn thing, we don’t know. But the Democrat’s response to this “tax and spend” is “No we don’t, nah nah na-nah nah: invest” **This is political debate in a democracy. No it’s not. It’s the simulation of politics**." - Texan Rick Roderick

There is no defense of any kind, pointing a loaded gun at a person is an OFFENSIVE action, not home defense. Bullets do not simply jump into a gun. A gun doesn't have any useful purpose in the house.

**The 1954 Equation**

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

And Reddit fandom of Corporate America shit can not resist the USA being a joke. Laughing constantly, always joking. The attraction to shit-commenting and shit-posting has ruined the USA minds. Brain rot central, Reddit meme mill. Why is there no Reddit blackout protesting and begging for the world wide web (all nations) to protest ONLINE against Trump? Because people are too busy laughing away at the joke Trump is. Trump is playing Tony Clifton joker and Reddit can not resist joking!

Extremely popular top of front page /r/All - most upvoted comment. Fandom of White House mockery, Tony Clifton performances. People flock to Reddit to get the latest mockery out of Kremlin performers. "LMAO", amused, entertained. Reality TV jokies / junkies "LMAO" on Reddit just can never get enough of this mock feedback looping playing over and over, day after day. Putin won, Surkov won.

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still **have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained**.” “So what should we **play with**?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”. Nonfiction.

Short-length Twitter-think comment message. Downplaying how incredibly dangerous it is to just call this a minor "embarrassment". The abandonment of serious nonfiction and hard thinking in USA is a threat to the entire world and people on Reddit comment sections only care about the most superficial and shallow "cringe" aspect. Blows the minds of Reddit end-users that there is so much "crashing out" content. There is no resistance, just fandom grading each theatrics performance of the professional Surkov media students.

* "When NPD and psychopathy combine, they form a pattern of behavior called malignant narcissism. This isn’t a diagnosis, but a term coined by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and elaborated on by personality disorder expert, Otto Kernberg, to describe people so driven by feeling special that they essentially see other people as **pawns in their game** of kill or be killed, whether metaphorically or literally. Hitler, who murdered millions, Kim Jong-un, who’s suspected of ordering his uncle’s and brother-in-law’s deaths, and **Vladimir Putin, who jokes about “liquidating journalists”** — no doubt all fall in the category of malignant narcissist (among possessing other pernicious traits, like sadism, or delight in hurting others)."

Imagine being in the Reddit commenting crowd and making a low-effort imagination comment like this without ever pondering if Russian intelligence has blown-out the minds of your fellow Americans and you should be halting all your low-effort commenting and taking up intellectual defenses against the Kremlin. Imagine you witness people commenting every hour day and night about the White House with no concern that the commenting itself is "engagement addiction" to "antics politics". Never learning anything about serious and sophisticated Russian information warfare in favor of spending free time on Reddit making comments that play right into Putin's conditioned programming by the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency.

Putin is alive and abusing both Russian and Ukraine children for sex and power in front of the whole world. The cult of celebrity television and celebrity film fiction is out of fucking control in USA. People can not turn to nonfiction serious learning and do a Reddit blackout / Bluesky blackout. People just keep yammering on and on in comments about Trump and are not demanding the REMOVAL of Trump and Dr. Bandy X Lee's mental health education and teaching for the whole fucking nation.

No matter how absurd or surreal a White House and Kremlin idea is, Reddit users just eat it up as a discussion topic. Instead of shutting down Reddit in blackout, protesting, to remove Trump, the simulation of commenting about every plot twist and idea coming out is all people fucking car about. Commenting about the food as the nation burns to the ground. The addiction to high speed messaging eclipses all goodness.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1r29x7k/whats_he_really_hunting_for/o4vw6o1/

It's just a simulation on Reddit of making simple points like this. As I have to do on GitHub to zero audience. The detachment from the real world is so extreme that people can not grasp what has happened. The attacking of Canada, being abusive to people for kindness, wasn't a "red flag" enough for Reddit audiences to maybe say the ENTIRE ROOM, the entire NATION is compromised, and that maybe just maybe gaslighting actually WORKS. Not just saying "gas lighting", but that the manipulation is not just one person fucking with a partner in a house - but an organized crime technique with all the most powerful media players in on it! Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, on and on. 

There isn't anyone calling for reality. Just compulsive mocking back and forth in feedback loops. People have never found it more easy to declare how dumb the White House has become. And people have never been more engaged in low-effort reactions.

The bullshit that "our government does not represent We The People" that people play will not fly with a nation that has school shootings and worships Superman and Batman fantasy. The praise of all-powerful men / daddy issues / Daddy Trump male authority figures is what is fed to children by adult parents.

"insane". 

It is INSANE how many people do not listen to the women in their life. In my high school, Snider High in Fort Wayne Indiana - I distinctly remember year 1984 and 1985 etc. listening to girls talk to each other about the older men that were giving them gifts and secret affairs. Since I was a book nerd reading in class all the time, they talked right in front of me and I never once was accused of spreading rumors or sharing secrets. Reddit constantly cracks jokes about what it is like in Ohio with men manipulating boys. My mother is from Ohio, my father is from Ohio, my two brothers are from Ohio. https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/07/11/in-new-documentary-former-ohio-state-wrestlers-say-u-s-rep-jim-jordan-knew-about-strauss-abuse/ The abuse men do **to other men** and girls younger than them is suburban Ohio and Indiana - and I expect all over USA. It isn't just wealthy billionaires. Hot girls in my high school classrooms were not afraid to discuss their "weekend and night outings" at age 14 and age 15. But men DO NOT LISTEN. Men do not READ BETWEEN THE LINES. People in my high school couldn't read between the lines of hot girls talking any more than reading between the lines of Shakespeare or James Joyce! People were too busy fixated on keeping balls in rectangle lines as competition. The hot age 14 and age 15 girls were targeted and prized by charming men over age 30! But Reddit behaves like only Epstein USA has this going on, not "Christian culture USA, Football Culture USA". 

People couldn't read between the lines of December 11, 1987 Indianapolis Indiana song on the Frequency Modulation radio lyrics either. "LOOK HERE" is the fucking title of the song, READ BETWEEN THE LINES! Age 14 age 15 girls are not the most impossible language to crack, it isn't Bible level Romans 11:32 verse encryption!

Simple-think. NATO has been entirely re-arranged by Putin and Trump. The USA is imploding into an explosion, the caloric density of meme-think Twitter-length short-message mind patterns, circling between media platform to media platform (media ocean to media ocean, medium to medium, media ecology to media ecology, media environment to media environment at higher and higher reaction twitching speeds). Cramming neurodiversity nation into tiny-think Apple iPhone meme screen images. We The People on Reddit, as programmed by the Saint Petersburg IRA, have boiled away all the water of life to simplistic bare wires.

* "Quixote saved the adventure for himself by inventing a magician who had just transformed the giants he had gone forth to encounter into windmills. You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not a mechanistic world in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and **behavioristic psychology, that we’re nothing but a predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli**. This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life." - age 83, published year 1988.

Where USA Government goes, Reddit fandom follows. The more stupid the federal government leads, the more the fandom avoids nonfiction on Reddit.

There have never been more Reddit meme addicts ready to purchase souls of fellow Americans. People who seek out hate leadership of the White House to follow from their Reddit fandom. People who find disaster a form of entertainment on their Reddit app screens. Instead of REDDIT_BLACKOUT having a protest blackout to call for reform and remedial morality teaching lessons for MAGA cult, the Reddit cult has joined in the mockery.

Social media sports-think society loves to deport people with ICE, block people with Reddit cloud computing machines and face-masked secret moderators and admins. Machine-think blocking and book burning is incredibly popular and people don't even recognize that in 1937 Germany had to burn magazines and books on paper with real flame and didn't have block buttons.

No, they do not act like children. They command powerful systems and use decades of experience as adults to manipulate other adults. They behave like USA adults who have been mentally manipulated by Putin's Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg since March 2013... and whatever new organization names and techniques that copycats and Russia have devised in year 2026. Reddit audiences keep downplaying the threat as mere "children" when NATO has lost an adult information war using the most sophisticated monomyth techniques of the Levant (adapted to modern Internet medium).

Reddit community refuses to have a REDDIT_BLACKOUT blackout protest and promote Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 mental health experts. But member of Reddit spend their free time and spare time calling people unhinged and keeping Trump in power by not quoting, promoting, and repeat promoting Dr. Bandy X Lees nonfiction book from October 3, 2017. This fandom of Epstein e-mail messages and details does not want the information show to stop with all the Trump lead methods.. there is no healthy sense or danger that Dr. Bandy X Lee put in the very TITLE of her book! Reddit community avoids promoting authentic goodness leadership that Dr. Bandy X Lee has been providing to the general public / citizens of the nation:

* “Assessing dangerousness is different from making a diagnosis: it is dependent on the situation, not the person. Signs of likely dangerousness due to mental disorder can become apparent without a full diagnostic interview and can be detected from a distance, and one is expected to err, if at all, on the side of safety when the risk of inaction is too great.”

The cult of celebrity on Reddit wants to keep Trump on stage as long as possible to satisfy the media delivery / notification cult desires. The rich men secrets cultists of Reddit will do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING to avoid calling for a BIG SERIOUS IMMEDIATE REDDIT_BLACKOUT and having Trump removed from office. The amusement and entertainment addictions to the celebrity and status symbol persons information drives all behavior. the URGENT crisis is cult deprogramming so men are not ongoing harming people... the danger is extreme... the information addictions are what We The People on Reddit information platform desire. Instead of promoting and rescuing hearts and mins with Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction education and leadership.

Bad Bunny is billionaire filmed / billionaire Judy Allen NFL team owner content for Reddit fandom. Instead of doing a serious sustained REDDIT_BLACKOUT and BLUESKY_BLACKOUT and making world press coverage calling for Trump to be removed. People keep acting as if a 15 entertainment show at the Super Bowl was a bit "gotcha" protest. Simulation between Kid Rock and Bad Bunny is corporate profit making, selling music, selling advertising for Jody Allen's team profit brand growth. The macro economics of this "diss track" behavior are great, just like last year Super Bowl "diss track" simulations. Reddit audience is entertained to see Kid Rock defeated. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_Bowl these days (2026 iPad iPhone era) people have a dozen screens in front of them at family gatherings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_counterprogramming

ANYTHING but do a REDDIT_BLACKOUT where WE THE PEOPLE of the USA can demonstrate to the entire world wide web that we have come to our media addiction cult sense and do NOT want antics politics and Reality TV Fox News and Reality Surkov Putinism running our nation any more. Trump's death does NOT demonstrate MEDIA USAGE REFORM of the general population. Cults of Twitter / Elon Musk Twitter / Facebook / Reddit have been the source of Trumpism / MAGA alternate-reality anti-reality! 

We the People have to face up to what Neil Postman wrote in his 1985 nonfiction book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" about Reddit and Twitter! This cult of death is exactly what Trump is leading, a death cult, and this entire Reddit posting I've linked is a death-cult! People need to put GOODNESS, stand up for GOODNESS on social media. More death cult fantasy parties is just following the leadership of MAGA death cult.

Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership should be repeated and repeated and quoted over and over constant on social media until people can organize the largest cult deprogramming in world history.

Why was there no REDDIT_BLACKOUT Reddit blackout in September 2024 to let the world know that We the  People do not support Donald Trump? I saw Trump signs all over in places I have lived and traveled and can identify real attitudes and behaviors. The cult of Fox News HDTV in 2024 and cult of Newsmax HDTV was as strong as ever 2024. Reddit fandom can not face up to their own cult of stimulation that Trump provides. Why are people not protesting on Reddit any time in year 2025? January 2026? The denial of the importance of We The People and intelligence and defending against Russian information warfare. 

The Founding Fathers did not have color photography in year 1776. Media has dramatically changed since year 2007 when the Apple iPhone 1 was introduced. Reddit cult of media can not see that Trump is a cult leader that Reddit follows every hour of every day. This movement is way bigger than election days and into the very social fabric of society of men hating upon women. Why is Reddit society not promoting woman leader Dr. Bandy X Lee? Woman leader Jen Senko?

Women like Pam Bondi are hated and mocked constantly. Why is it when a serious nonfiction leader like Jen Senko and Dr. Bandy X Lee are leading towards good directions, Reddit and Blueksy do not follow the women? AOC is very entertaining and engages is mocking that Reddit prizes. Attraction to mocking back and forth with antics politics is the pattern of what captures attention of fandoms.

Reddit community can not face that Reddit is heavily influenced by billionaire media owners and the investment billionaires have made in media in general. And that is what Trump has spent decades focused on, being *on camera* more than anyone, being the center of Reddit attention more than anyone with antics and odd behavior. Mocking more than anyone, Reddit's (community, audience) attraction to mockery and avoidance of serious Dr. Bandy X Lee nonfiction.

Reddit will not call for impeachment and blackouts of social media - because the attraction to mocking and insulting Trump is stronger than the desire to REMOVE Trump and educate and teach people remedial morality and why it is dangerous to be in a media cult (Reddit media cults) of fiction.

"Sane person"

Every topic of every day on every media platform is about stimulating cults of fiction addicts. People even regularly write "cult" about out-groups but will not turn to nonfiction. You don't see people calling for nonfiction cult deprogramming. You see "brainwashing" but you do not witness any call for nonfiction education on how to counter and rescue brainwashed people. You witness compulsive high speed commenting... reactionary mindsets, reacting to MAGA reacting to Trump, reacting to the White House.

A representative should have the paperwork staff and skills to create a website for under $200 with basic text content and have it online in 1 to 8 hours of labor. And point people to THE SAME PAGE OF ACTION and timelines. www . Remove Trump Crow . org - and be able to update it. Square Space or other provider for a basic blog of information... could use Google Blogger with a registered Internet domain.

People could then link and monitor the website for updates. Instead, a "concept of a plan".

I've posted about "Brain Rot Society" and called out the need to use social media in non-reactionary ways. On Lemmy, Bluesky, Mastodon. Nobody is interested. I just now posted a Dr. Bandy X Lee posting - and reviewed the activity on her Bluesky posts from October.

“Whenever I ask my Russian bosses, the older TV producers and media types who run the system, what it was like growing up in the late Soviet Union, whether they believed in the Communist ideology that surrounded them, they always laugh at me.  
“Don’t be silly,” most answer.  
“But you sang the songs? Were good members of the Komsomol?”   
“Of course we did, and we felt good when we sang them. And then straight after we would listen to ‘Deep Purple’ and the BBC.”   
“So you were dissidents? You believed in finishing the USSR?”   
“No. It’s not like that. You just speak several languages at the same time, all the time. There’s like several ‘you’s.”   
Seen from this perspective, the great drama of Russia is not the “transition” between communism and capitalism, between one fervently held set of beliefs and another, but that during the final decades of the USSR no one believed in communism and yet carried on living as if they did, and now they can only create a society of simulations. For this remains the common, everyday psychology: **the Ostankino producers who make news worshiping the President in the day and then switch on an opposition radio as soon as they get off work; the political technologists who morph from role to role with liquid ease — a nationalist autocrat one moment and a liberal aesthete the next**; the “orthodox” oligarchs who sing hymns to Russian religious conservatism—and keep their money and families in London. All cultures have differences between “public” and “private” selves, but in Russia the contradiction can be quite extreme.”

Superficial, shallow, banal is what makes Reddit audiences happy. Instead of using social media for cult deprogramming (returning to non-entertainment based Surkovian governing), people are commenting on each scene and performance of the players. There is no desire to end the antics politics and harm it is doing, because that would remove the Reddit audience attraction to the anti-goodness prizing.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1r3lvq2/karoline_leavitt_trolled_as_shes_caught_using_bad/o55f170/

The Office is fiction television. Michael Scott is a fiction character. Donald Trump played fiction "The Apprentice" television. Reddit is a cult that is attracted to following fiction content. To understand why MAGA and Trumpism has taken over the USA... study the fiction attraction and audience cravings for more and more fiction-based leadership. Surkovian governing and Surkovian information warfare.

Joe Rogan Experience and Reddit audience experience suffer from the same media-engagement audience techniques. I am not saying Reddit users are all fans and listen to Joe Rogan. I'm saying the same low-effort media that favors fiction over nonfiction is prized by both fandoms. Amusement and comedy "news".

This is a cultural wide, not just voters, not just MAGA, everyone in society problem. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" is a starting point on understanding this self-harm attraction.

"Tears into him" - the mental health of mob mentality is a problem ANYONE on ANY MEDIA platform, including Reddit commenting can address. Dr. Bandy X Lee compiled 27 people in a book published October 3, 2017. Yet, everyone is avoiding turning to nonfiction teaching and education. We don't need more debate and arguing, we need to recognize the addiction to Trump as a content source is a problem both Joe Rogan and Reddit both share. All media systems have converged on Epstein / Trump / MAGA mentality of media addiction to fiction storytelling.

The avoidance of Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017 has been consistent across society. People are not engaging nonfiction serious topics that are organized and well written. Instead, streaming podcasts of Rogan and streaming commenting of Reddit, streaming shit-postings of Bluesky...  THE STREAMING, the SCROLLING itself is prized over *getting on the same page of a paper nonfiction book* that describes a **common problem we all share**. People all have one URL click or touch that we could converge on: https://www.ScientificAmerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/ and start facing up to the **motion addiction of flowing information** streaming.

Yes. You watched Evil be programmed right into hearts and minds. And your parents **warned you about Russia, KGB**. Putin worked for the KGB before the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany. Your parents warned you to *keep an eye on Russia*. Not to turn your back on Russians and be complacent. And you are today on Reddit making jokes over and over to joke-wash sane-wash the **clearly mentally disturbed behavior of American people** (We The People) who have been manipulated, via Reddit invasion, by the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency since March of 2013. You are members of Reddit February 2026 - which is nothing like Reddit of year 2012 - you are members of an anti-compassion anti-empathy anti-intellectual **cult of hate, a death cult**, that thinks it is funny to exploit what Putin has done to *rural less-educated* Americans via the Apple iPhone venue! You sold our your fellow Americans to the Kremlin without any defense. Your elderly parents were some of the last people in USA to get an Apple iPhone / Apple iPad and you let Russia **FUBAR your own parent's minds**. Cowards, afraid of the fucking public library. You didn't defend at all, **you embraced the Kremlin's psych**ological **war**fare. Surkov won the war.

ANSWER: Reddit users are avoidant of nonfiction learning. Instead, people are engaged in REACTING to CDC actions by the White House. People on Reddit are REACTING to Republican political party and Kremlin political organized crimes. People using social media systems are NOT turning to Dr. Bandy X Lee as a leader and quoting her nonfiction books and articles. ANY NATION in the entire world could be elevating Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 contributors from her October 3, 2017 book. But the entire world is failing to take mental health of the White House seriously as a educational teaching topic.

Reddit Fandom of MAGA, the Trumpism fandom cult on Reddit, has extreme recency bias. RECENCY_BIAS Minds are being reset constantly with extreme laughter and joke sessions over Trump / MAGA / Musk and people blow their memories out. Neil Postman warned of this mind exploit in his year 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" - which is a nonfiction book about Reddit authored decades before Reddit went online.

The constant "shocked" and "amazed" reaction is a SYMPTOM of over-amusement! We are over 10 years into deep shit and people are thinking that it only started last week or this month. Thinking itself is corrupted by laughter. Laughter is the best mind-fuck. Surkov won.

People can't see that EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME is laughing and mocking at the total mockery created by Surkov students. Russia won the information war exploiting this HIGHLY PREDICTABLE reaction. It blows minds to LOL away issues. Gallows humor has been weaponized. BLIND_FAITH in laughing. Instead of doing a Reddit blackout, REDDIT_BLACKOUT - people are LOL LOL LOL all day every minute of every day for over A DECADE LONG laughter shit-show at Trump! Trump shit-posts on Truth Social and Reddit end-users drag it over to Reddit for crowds frolicking in Trump's shit comedy! The POTUS Tony Clifton act works on Reddit fandom EVERY DAMN TIME!

* “For in the end, he was trying to tell us what afflicted the people in 'Brave New World' was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. New York University.

QUOTE FROM NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS

When conformity enforcers overwhelm diversity generators, all of us are in trouble. Spartans -- fundamentalists, militia groups, fascists, and ultra-nationalists -- can freeze the machinery of collective mind. A shutdown of urban diversity devastates that exercise of collective acumen we call an economy. Christian Fundamentalism has been shown by the research of sociologists Alfred Darnell and Darren E. Sherkat to retard the learning of children raised within its grasp. Darnell and Sherkat sum up a common Fundamentalist attitude in the following words: "No schooling is better than secular schooling." Then there's the paralysis of thought which outright battle brings. When World War I erupted, Sigmund Freud was horrified by the sudden "narrow-mindedness shown by \[even\] the best intellects, their obduracy, their inaccessibility to the most forcible arguments." Such closings of the mind may explain why authoritarians are prone to ignore it when their approaches flop. They often goose-step from one year to another rigidly glued to backfiring ways.

GULLIBLE_FANDOM An audience of Apple computers and Reddit /r/Technology love that is so gullible to news sources that it believes billionaire talking points. Unable to turn to serious nonfiction. For over a decade, parroting away about "the government" without seeing the influence the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad have had with Twitter-thinking short-message mocking that is all too predictable of social media consumers.

And Reddit commenting section is news? it is ALL entertainment. Another Twitter-length short message upvoted high on the page. Reddit fandom of MAGA can not cite nonfiction serious discussions of the problems of media systems and the cult of fiction storytelling Fox News feeds.

Every subreddit of Reddit is an "alternate universe", alternate reality game of fiction fandoms. Thousands and thousands of Fox News entertainment-style communities as subreddits. This was published more than a decade ago, but Reddit society repulses nonfiction media analysis:

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.

Fiction outsells nonfiction. Reddit community can't comprehend that Reddit itself is full of fiction storytelling and that nonfiction books on paper have been abandoned by the entire society. People are avoidant of seriously organizing and promoting critical nonfiction teaching and education for adults. Dr. Bandy X Lee assembled 27 people and published a book October 3, 3017 that every Reddit user should be quoting, linking, citing - but it rots on the shelf and people are drawn to commenting over and over all on different pages and not getting on the same pages of very important nonfiction books on paper.

Like the 27 people Dr. Bandy X lee assembled in her nonfiction book published October 3, 2017. That Reddit can't seem to locate at the public library and rescue the USA from Trump.

Mythology and fiction has been proven far more popular as a way of governing. Surkov governing. But Reddit users can't be bothered to learn about Russia's war against nonfiction since March 2013 via Reddit manipulation using the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency. Reddit tech fandoms now prefer no-identity screen shots off Twitter on /r/All and no-identity commenting that avoids any kind of FAQ and Wiki organization of important critical society topics. Nonfiction books quotes relevant to the topics at hand are deafening silence on Reddit. But low-effort commenting all at different times sure is thriving and breeding!

* “If all information is seen as part of a war, **out go any dreams of a global information space where ideas flow freely, bolstering deliberative democracy**. Instead, the best future one can hope for is an ‘information peace’, in which each side respects the other’s ‘information sovereignty’: a favoured concept of both Beijing and Moscow, and essentially a cover for enforcing censorship.”

IGNORANCE_CELEBRATIONS on Reddit comment section. "Breitbart News Network was created in mid-2007 by American conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart." **Fox News went online October 7, 1996** - Putin's birthday which is is more than a decade BEFORE Breitbart network. The very Reddit posting title mentions Fox News. Rupert Murdoch has been doing global media systems like this all over the world. Neil Postman's book, "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about television news - published in year 1985 was already raising very serious and important concerns. Just like Reddit memes do in year 2026:

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

Neil Postman, year 1985: "We may surmise that the ninety million Americans who watch television every night also think so. But what I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience. Our television set keeps us in constant communion with the world, but it does so with a face whose smiling countenance is unalterable. The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that **all subject matter is presented as entertaining**, which is another issue altogether."

Neil Postman, year 1985: "To say it still another way: **Entertainment is the supra-ideology of all discourse on television. No matter what is depicted or from what point of view, the overarching presumption is that it is there for our amusement and pleasure**. That is why even on news shows which provide us daily with fragments of tragedy and barbarism, we are urged by the newscasters to “join them tomorrow.” What for? One would think that several minutes of murder and mayhem would suffice as material for a month of sleepless nights. We accept the newscasters’ invitation because we know that **the “news” is not to be taken seriously, that it is all in fun**, so to say. Everything about a news show tells us this — the good looks and amiability of the cast, their pleasant banter, the exciting music that opens and closes the show, the vivid film footage, **the attractive commercials** — all these and more suggest that what we have just seen is no cause for weeping. A news show, to put it plainly, is a format for entertainment, not for education, reflection or catharsis."

― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: [Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. page 87. Year 1985.](https://books.google.com/books?id=zGkhbPEjkRoC&pg=PA87&dq=%22The+problem+is+not+that+television+presents+us+with+entertaining+subject+matter+but+that+all+subject+matter+is+presented+as+entertaining.%E2%80%9D&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjQ-aP3z9eSAxW5CTQIHcW8ALQQ6AF6BAgHEAM)

RECENCY_BIAS Recency bias abounds on Reddit comment section. Adults do not educate themselves with nonfiction on these critical and serious topics and are attracted to creating extremely low-effort commenting on important concerns. "State media is here", this was spelled out in year 1985 that entertainment seeking fandoms like Reddit audience behaves... is far more concerned with amusements and tech /r/Technology diversions.

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. **The President does not have the press under his thumb**. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and **narcoticized by tech**nological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111
* * Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

The Reddit culture of avoiding FAQ and Wiki systems with everyone in filter-bubbles https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble on different pages (creating low-effort comments) is a huge source of problems regarding serious and critical topics.

ANSWER: a nation of commenting addicts and like-button toching addicts, upvote-button addicts... people who avoid nonfiction learning for adults. We The People of the USA have abandoned nonfiction in favor of low-effort commenting on page after page of social media systems. Trump is a media addict leading  nation of media addictions. Surkov won since March 2013. Reddit can't face the addiction problems and have a REDDIT_BLACKOUT protest to demonstrate that We The People are the power of society - and instead people keep making shit-commenting and shit-postings and AMUSEMENT_AS_USUAL with entertainment and memes. No matter how horrific it has gotten, Reddit users can't call to get on the same page of critical and important nonfiction topics. GTA6 news and Steam sales is more a Reddit fandom concern that having an Internet protest to remove Trump and put Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 people front and center regarding MAGA cult.

You see replies to this comment about 75% of the population. SO MUCH DENIAL of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter, Donald Trump Truth Social, Fox News HDTV, the **extreme low-effort commenting all over Reddit**. Shit-commenting, shit-posting, EVERYWHERE in USA society! The enshitification problems and crisis! The Brain Rot problem and crisis! Donald Trump was OUT OF OFFICE for 4 years, Joe Biden took over, but the BRAIN ROT of Apple iPhone / Apple iPad / Samsung Android device users CONTINUED! Joe Biden did not address the cult issues of high-speed information systems!

WHY IS REDDIT community Not doing BLACKOUTS AS PROTESTS, Internet PROTESTING, and landing on the front page of world news sections all over planet Earth? REDDIT_BLACKOUT - because anti-MAGA is a cult. Reddit audience is a **media cult** of mocking and insulting! "Leopard At Faces" cultists! Meme cult of making memes about Trump and his supporters!

We The People have NOT demonstrated any self-awareness that the addiction to IRA memes and Elon Musk Twitter has been at the core of the USA's abandonment of nonfiction serious books and learning for adults since year 2013. The level of reform require is a MASSIVE uprising of the ENTIRE POPULATION age 12 to age 120, voters and non-voters alike, to demonstrate a newfound serious focus on nonfiction learning on media ecology, science, intellectual pursuits. To stop the mocking and insulting of intelligence that Putin has programmed deeply into mindsets.

Where is the BLUESKY_BLACKOUT and REDDIT_BLACKOUT ? Where are the parents telling their children they were bamboozled by Fox News? People are addicted to hate leadership so they can hate-watch and mock and feel emotionally superior to terrible men. But the men are in power because people will not turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee and other nonfiction leaders to face the emotions and hate that has been normalized. Now many broken marriages and families because of Donald Trump? How many sexual abuse copycats? People are not calling for an emotional and intellectual awakening to the manipulation they have been subjected to by billionaires and their media techniques. Surkov won since March of year 2013.

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241.

The commenting addictions, the fandom of hate, looks terrible for the whole nation. The absence of INTERNET_BLACKOUT protesting. The absence of RESCUE MAGA promoting. "Save the USA from billionaires, we were all manipulated by the richest man on Earth, Elon Musk, and Trump" - the absence of standing up for common decency, common goodness, getting ton the same page behind Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership since her public education book with 27 authors... nonfiction published October 3, 2017. Every day of life is a sick society of people commenting over and over and not confronting how Trump is an entertainer playing a "hate me hard" character, Tony Clifton character, and people are media "engaged" and Trump is a bad-ass influencer. Rupert Murdoch wrecked families on a smaller scale, Trump is a threat to the entire world. Children all over planet earth are being given this role model because USA social media addicts will not study and learn from Neil Postman's library of books.

Joe Rogan has harmed people like a terrorist mosque in an Islamic nation leading a cult of worship of ignorance. IGNORANCE_CELEBRATIONS Living next to people who are cults of Joe Rogan media celebrity and cults of Trump hate messaging is horrific. These men who love and worship Joe Rogan not only hate women { Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris } but avoid brave women who teach positive to the general public like Jen Senko and Dr. Bandy X Lee.

This is why I say turn to the writings of Malala from January 2009 to year 2015. Her raging confrontation of egoism and egomania when she was outraged at how men treat other men and how men treat women. It is there in her blogs, in her writings, in her interviews, in her speeches. But people can not get behind a woke and intelligent girl leader (she was a girl in 2013 when her book was published October 8, 2013).

People are unattractive to nonfiction serious thinkers. People are attracted to low-effort lazy shallow commenting over and over and over on social machines and attracted to Joe Rogan Experience, podcasts, junk media. Malala's ideas need peer to peer assertion, repeating, not more Joe Rogan repeating. Malala's ideas are a bottom-up rebalance of power away form elderly power men in the Taliban, Russia, White House, Saudi Arabia. Give girls a voice, start listening to girls!

15 years ago. Year 2011. Language has changed since 15 years ago is what this Reddit commenting has drawn attention to.

* October 20, 2011. https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin "the stage is constantly changing: the country is a dictatorship in the morning, a democracy at lunch, an oligarchy by suppertime, while, backstage, oil companies are expropriated, journalists killed, billions siphoned away. **Surkov is at the centre of the show**, sponsoring nationalist skinheads one moment, backing human rights groups the next. It’s a strategy of power based on keeping any opposition there may be constantly confused, a ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it’s indefinable. This fusion of despotism and postmodernism, in which no truth is certain, is reflected in the craze among the **Russian elite for neuro-linguistic programming**"

And then the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg started exporting it to the World Wide Web, including Reddit.

* "Documents Show How Russia’s Troll Army Hit America. The adventures of Russian agents like The Ghost of Marius the Giraffe, Gay Turtle, and Ass — exposed for the first time." Max Seddon; June 2, 2014 - "The trolls appear to have taken pains to **learn the sites' different commenting systems**.

Despite world history, and Putin being in power for over 25 years, the TRUMP_FANDOM of JD Vance and White House / Kremlin can not imagine that this mental exploit of We The People is the very mechanism of power. That attraction to hate, flocking to hate leaders, is the very means Trump + JD Vance has so much **social power, political power**, wealth power over the world. That *hate motivates* everyday people to go to Reddit and comment and comment about how much they hate the media experience and encounters of JD Vance. That this is the very means, techniques, and methods of Surkov students! The loathing of what Putin's Russia does to Ukraine since year 2013 is the very population power.

Year 2014. December 31, 2014:

* "The underlying aim, Surkov says, is **not to win the war**, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - December 31, 2014. And Russia has indeed not won the war, currently February 2026. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

Just like **Fox News HDTV fandom of hate content** that is **not-self aware of their attraction to hate-content and hate-watching**, the Reddit commenting community, the end-users of Reddit, are attracted to hate-signals and hate icons / hate status symbols without being self-aware.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

Reddit users are not educated. Reddit users have not been taught that this is the very mechanism Surkov governing techniques / media techniques exploit. That hate and loathing are the mental brain entry point Putin cult / MAGA cult is based upon. Surkov won since March 2013.

* "I've seen too much hate to want to hate myself; hate is too great a burden to bear. I've seen it on the faces of too many sheriffs of the South — I've seen hate. In the faces and even the walk of too many Klansmen of the South, **I've seen hate. Hate distorts** the personality. **Hate does something to the soul that causes one to lose his objectivity.** The man **who hates can't think straight**; the man **who hates can't reason right; the man who hates can't see right**; the man who hates can't walk right. And I know now that Jesus is right, that love is the way. And this is why John said, "God is love," so that he who hates does not know God, but he who loves at that moment has the key that opens the door to the meaning of **ultimate reality**." - July 4, 1965 Atlanta, Georgia.

This is classic extreme short-message Twitter-thinking SATIRE_SARCASM_WASHING of White House as a constant steady supply of jokes and humor. This is the Reddit fandom, Reddit cult, of jokes and memes. The cult on Reddit does not with to turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee and REMOVE JD Vance from the White House with Internet uprising of quotes and teachings for the general public / population from Dr. Lee - and instead is attracted to JD Vance content on Reddit as a way to waste time, spare time and free time, cracking jokes about how great it is to joke and be amused by the hate leadership (that Reddit fandom follows around in cult usage of their media devices).

The Reddit cult members using symbolism / status symbols / icons of Pope Catholic symbol combined with White House USA symbolism / icons... re-arranging these in the minds is the cult addiction. Surkov students have enslaved the Reddit audience with this since March 2013. The Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg has seeded perpetual mind patterns of cult-thinking hive minded "we are the cook kids" street-gang signs and symbols. People who can not escape the total mockery / mocking media platforms. People who mock in predictable conditioned mentally programmed patterns. Reddit was directly infiltrated to seed this tone.

* "Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using **crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion."** "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that **there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds**, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just **driving discussion away** completely," she adds.

The change in behavior was extreme of how much Donald Trump / MAGA was viewed as an entertainment / celebrity Reality TV star, source of comedy content, jokes and humor memes. The Internet Research Agency seed the mocking of "inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change the climate of discussion." - Nonfiction common ground was wrecked in favor of common ground (common thinking patterns) of jokes, humor, memes, amusement about how great it was to have Donald Trump as a constant source of absurd comedy and surreal humor. Surkov won since March of year 2013.

* "r/The_Donald was a subreddit where participants created discussions and internet memes in support of U.S. president Donald Trump. Initially created in June 2015"; "The subreddit grew to be known for frequent posting of memes, especially Pepe the Frog, and frequent uses of slang terms such as "centipede" (a reference to a much-distributed Trump highlight reel featuring the Knife Party song "Centipede"), "MAGA", "nimble navigator", "no brakes", "cuck", "4D chess", and "SJW". Furthermore, users on the site referred to Trump as "God Emperor". For a period of time, the subreddit repeatedly posted an image of Hillary Clinton kissing Robert Byrd, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan. The image was accompanied by a photoshopped picture of an aged Byrd in Klan garb, which was meant to falsely portray Clinton and Byrd as Klan supporters. Byrd had severed ties with the Ku Klux Klan in 1952." - Reddit history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/The_Donald

Unsettling brain exploitation, it is PREDICTABLE_OUTCOME - Reddit is a FANDOM to this technique, Reddit comment creators are in a CULT of media that unsettles them. They have not met JD Vance in person, shaken his hand, ti is images of media systems, it is video clips that ALONE create this. Like a horror film cult audience, cult films. But this is constant, JD Vance / Trump / Putin / Musk give this sense of fiction unreality, like a fiction horror film. Mythological. Surkov cracked the Levant monomyth media John 1:1 patterns (at least the out-group hate clergy side, anti-compassion anti-goodness, anti-empathy) somewhere around year 2010 from my own reckoning.

Trump and Putin have shown that Surkov governing is very popular with Reddit media cult members. Fiction and stimulating media is very popular on Reddit. Low-effort commenting that avoids serious nonfiction on the critical and important topics.

Posting title "funny", amusing. Neil Postman was correct in year 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about Reddit media audience behaviors and outcomes.

22 day Reddit account. Trivializing the situation. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid dealing with the Fox News HDTV cult crisis. The QAnon cult crisis, etc. Reddit is a cult of hating other cults. Ask yourself why Reddit isn't promoting the mental health public education by Dr. Bandy X Lee who assembled 27 people to educate the everyday public? Why isn't Reddit social staging a newsworthy serious sustained INTERNET protest, blackout, Internet uprising... REDDIT_BLACKOUT

Posting and comment "cult", "cults". But people can't describe media cults, content cults. People do not meet Mohamamd, people engage media storytelling: Quran. People do not meet god or Jesus, they encounter a wildly creative science fiction story, The Bible media. This is the Bible verse "1 John 4:20" crisis - you have only seen a story, not god.

Reddit is a billionaire fandom, media cultists. Reddit end-user cultists will tolerate any abuse and Trumpism if media systems keep producing stimulating images. There is no Internet protest / Internet uprising because the cult of images and memes and low-effort comment content is what Cambridge Analytica and the IRA programmed into minds. The Trump government / Kremlin system is prized as a constant source of entertainment. TRUMP_FANDOM

"I really can't understand this" COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING People are not turning to nonfiction learning of cult behaviors and dangers. Dr. Bandy X Lee's compilation of 27 people for general public education is ignored since published October 3, 2017 describing the mental health crisis. Surkov won since March 2013.

Reddit is a fandom of stupid media and stupid leaders. Reddit society is not organizing nonfiction education and teaching to combat stupid. Stupid is just acknowledged and the cure to stupid, adult education, is not seen as something We The People on Reddit need to be doing. CONDITIONED_OPPOSITION

Top upvoted popular comment. Twitter-length short-think short-message patterns. MIND_BLOWN_BY billionaire Rupert Murdoch. Fox News has been around since October 7 of yer 1996. And Reddit community is so ignorant about media ecology of NYC, that people predictably have their minds blown about billionaires using Fox News network for control of the USA population. People on Reddit also behave as if Reddit, which is decades established, isn't overrun by Russia's IRA and Elon Musk owner of ISP Starlink, Memphis datacenter, Twitter resources, etc. Reddit community has done everything it can to avoid serous and sustained following of the lead created by Jen Senko since year 2015.

This is Reddit. Which has let the IRA overrun Reddit since March 2013. The anti-intellectual anti-nonfiction attitudes. Avoiding Jen Senko about brainwashing topic.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad people say "cult", "Fox News", "right-wing media" all over Reddit - but when "The Little Gal" stands up to right-wing media with a nonfction film. Crickets from Reddit in terms of promoting her name and film more than Epstein and more than just complain the word "cult". Putin has put Reddit into a simulation of resisting.
