Most upvoted (popular) comment. Assume Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin programming of media cults is to mock. Short-length Twitter-style commenting. The agenda Russia has is to harm Canada and USA NATO relations and for audiences to view this all as Reality Television / Reality Kremlin antics for guiding the shining meme device screens mindsets of the audience. This is fandom content for fans of shit-commenting shit-posting Truth Social leadership. This is shit-commenting content for followers of Trump's mastery of social machine addictions.

A long-form detailed off-Reddit citation comment! There needs to be a Wiki and FAQ compilation of topics, with focus on priority (this is not a high-priority concern, it is engagement content for Trump information fandoms)

This whole posting title is bullshit. The comment may be factual, but the post title is simulation of resistance. Fiction reality of The Bible does indeed trump over real science reality. Fox News HDTV fiction rules over our most important real problems. Kid Rock is not an important fucking subject. Fox News HDTV anti-reality is wrecking USA 24 hours a day.

And remember: Rural people do not have education from New York City. New York University. Manhattan Professor Neil Postman. And study Reddit commenting, a cult of avoiding nonfiction. Reddit is a cult of MAGA / ICE / Trump / Musk hate-watching. Study hard on the Reddit comments, observe the lack of concern to rescue USA and NATO from the mental manipulation Trump and Putin have done. AVOIDED: { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev } nonfiction.

The problem of Reddit society is that people are avoiding FAQ creation, Wiki creation, off-Reddit linking to stable information, nonfiction books on paper. Reddit is a cult community of low-effort commenting to avoid organizing the most critical and important information. AVOIDED: { Dr. Bandy X Lee, New York University Neil Postman, University of Toronto Marshall McLuhan, Johns Hopkins University Peter Pomerantsev } nonfiction.

Reddit audience is a cult of MAGA, cult of Trump, cult of billionaire media stunts. The Reddit cult is a hate-watching cult club. It takes YEARS to recognize this cult behavior of online media centers. "Early online hate-watching communities emerged with sites like Television Without Pity in 1998, which gleefully criticised every new episode of the teen series Dawson's Creek. In 2012, Emily Nussbaum discussed the concept in New Yorker" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching (it took until year 2012 to discuss the concept of online sites in year 1998).

Bring back a revival of older music that has been drowned out in Truth Social noise and static. Create an Opera of revival, including Dixie Chicks.

OPERA_A This song has even deeper roots, but the cover video and pregnancy visual themes are so great.

**Hate-based Economy**, ecology and economy of **out-group hate** media values and mindsets.  

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

If you **truly want to understand what is going on in USA** since year 2013, study this behavior on Reddit. DELIGHTED people to have hate in their life. To have high-speed TCP/IP media system to express how much they love and are delighted following the Putin + Trump hate leadership. We The People are the followers of hate. We The People prize hate, to seek out MAGA and USA audiences to hate. Hate vs. hate fandoms, Super Bowl team sports sport-mentality thinking of hate vs. hate as the ideal version of governing. You have to take the media ecology addiction to hate seriously, study the Middle East. I moved to Amman, Jordan during the Arab Spring Syria War outbreak in March 2011 to study media ecology of *hate for hate* fandoms. *Hate harder* competitive hate faith of Reddit users. Surkov won since March of year 2013.

**The 1954 Equation**

Sunday, February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

“At the front door I pat my trouser pocket to check for the thin outline of my passport and realize it’s not there. Always the passport, always the “dokumenti!” **You can get stopped and checked for papers at any moment**. It might only actually happen once or maybe even twice a year, but you still have to stand in queues and knock on doors to obtain the whole library of little stamps, regulations, permits — the legal stipulations and requirements that are themselves always changing. A little trick to keep you always on tenterhooks, always patting your pockets for your papers, always waking up worried that you might have lost them in a bar. Over time you begin to pat for the passport instinctively, your hand going down unthinkingly to check your pocket so many times a day you don’t even notice any more. That’s true power — when it starts to influence the unconscious movements of your arms.”
― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: [The Surreal Heart of the New Russia. **Year 2014**. Page 117.](https://books.google.com/books?id=OJToBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA117&dq=%22Over+time+you+begin+to+pat+for+the+passport+instinctively,+your+hand+going+down+unthinkingly+to+check+your+pocket%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

Think hard, ponder. How does that 2014 nonfiction book quote about Moscow apply to USA 2025, USA 2026 and ICE / immigration enforcement... Putin and Trump relationship runs very deep in the psychological levels. "That’s true power — when it starts to influence the unconscious..."

Reddit society is corrupt. We The People are corrupt. Surkov won since March 2013. Prizing hate of *any person* for *any reason* is what Surkov students exploited. Every pattern of hate imaginable.
