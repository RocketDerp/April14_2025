Post Title:      Bolton on Trump Venezuela plan: ‘I don’t think he understands anything’

It’s really impressive how much they make the insanity of bush jr. look like a competent and reasonable presidentship.

That's because people in USA are unwilling to study **nonfiction** of Russia, how wild and bad it is. USA was founded on a thinking system by Free Masons, but that's been abandoned. Pluribus gets mocked for any serious discourse of Free Mason ideals and art work meaning.

I keep seeing people say this like somehow there is some genius plan underneath or something. Look the Nazis were also idiots. They flexed incredible competence often towards truly fantastically idiotic aims near constantly. Those around them spent the regime trying to twist the actions into making sense out of shear sense of duty and belief. Like all the facts that have ever come before, it's not about efficiency, it's not about plans, it's not about high ideals, it's about staying in power and gaining more power and that's it. That's the plan. It show strings and bubble gum, wishes and prayers all the way down. It's the competency being wielded for it eroniously that's the challenge not them.

We keep trying to believe that merit is what it takes to rise to the top. It is not. If you see clearly you can realize that, that is the last skill it ever takes to get ahead. And in this case we have the example in point that it is not what it takes to gain power. It doesn't mean they don't have that power. That is a completely separate thing. 

Might does not make right it makes round holes the exceptable path for square blocks. There is no concern for shape. Efficiency doesn't matter. They are hammers and we are nails no matter what fastener we actually are. It's a waste and it will show itself when we are dead as door nails. But the reallity is it's colossally incompetent, colossally wasteful. And there in lies the key to its downfall.

It isn't easy to leave a high\-control group, let alone decline a pardon *and* make a public apology. I'm not giving a pass to every MAGA supporter but I believe this person is sincere and we *need* more MAGA supporters to see the light and follow suit.

Unfortunately I think she will always be in the minority. People who support Trump have deeply seated issues that would require years of therapy to overcome, and that even assumes that they'd be willing to try. But because their hate has been celebrated and validated, none of them will ever even be aware of their issues, much less address them.

Trump is a leader of media addiction on intimate touch devices. The introduction of the Apple iPhone in June 2007 has more to do with Trump Reality TV stardom coming over to Reddit than anything. 

This Reddit comment, the one linked, is celebrating Rupert Murdoch as the "deeply seated issue". Bamboozled Rural less-education population. Reddit users with the ability to write paragraphs like this will not engage Neil Postman's library of books. High Speed HDTV and Reddit messages are a risk to humanity and Neil Postman called it out in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", that is the deep-seated issue. October 7, 1996 Fox News, and then Reddit and Twitter came along, Facebook, etc. Elon Musk purchasing Twitter wasn't an accident and Reddit mocked away. Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk, Truth Social, Russia Today, Internet Research Agency.

When you have a nation with this unhealthy, over\-the\-top patriotism, where they see themselves as almost divinely chosen, a shining beacon, the biggest, the best, blah blah blah, mixed with insane inequality, a downright inhumane system, and a weird obsession with guns, it’s a recipe for disaster. America is full of decent people, but it’s never really figured out how to build a decent society.

From a global perspective, the big decay of the U.S. began in 2001\. What is happening now is the result of a series of events that have already taken place. Nothing occurs in a vacuum. Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 after witnessing the U.S. carry out a similar action in Iraq just a few years earlier. The war in Ukraine can be seen as an escalation of that dynamic. Now the U.S. is going full bunker mode, taking whatever it believes is theirs. The significance of 9/11 cannot be underestimated. It marked the beginning of internal unrest that gradually spilled out into the world. It also represented the peak of American power. In the end, Bin Laden won.

[Shit-eating LOL LOL amusement audience on Reddit, people grading the turds of Trump as they pour down / trickle down from the wealthy media empires](/Grim_Blunt/Society_of_grading_and_ranking_turds.md).

Reddit meme addicts do not realize Trump is an actor. Trump has been an actor decades before he went into the White House in early year 2017. Trump is acting. President Tony Clifton, live every day all day. Acting to Surkov screenplays, SNL NYC home town of Trump, Tony Clifton improvisation and scripting hybrid Russian warfare. ACTOR that Reddit community of meme addicts eat up, fall for.

Reddit audience comment contribution has now become the very source of Trump / MAGA / Fox News normal making, normalization... prizing shit as thrilling content.

No, what the conservatives want is 30 million Venezuelan slaves. When they fly the Confederate flag, that means slavery and always has meant slavery.

Also, it's not just Venezuelan ones, they'll enslave anyone they don't like, which is basically everyone. "Own the libs" is meant literally, that's why they're all falling in line behind Russian imperialism in more ways than one.

Right vs. left brainrot. Out-group brainrot mindsets. Human beings behave like this all over the world and throughout history. Out-group domination. Long before "left vs. right" was framing it. If other nations had the wealth, power, military, technology of the USA - Reddit users wouldn't grasp it is driven by masculine domination / power drives that we are not facing. If Russia had twice the power and 10 times the wealth, war with Ukraine and others would be worse. Reddit community mindset (mob mentality of left vs. right USA only) is to avoid American from Atlanta 1954 learning.

The post is bait, but the extra apostrophe is just a lack of basic English language skills. Or a typo. Probably the former tbh.

That is what is important on Reddit. Twitter messages screenshots on Reddit to mock and mockery away at. Constant simulation by Elon Musk media platform on Reddit. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to avoid using spare time and free time to learn nonfiction cult behavior issues to Reddit media and Tweet media.

Simple-short messages. Prizing of Twitter content. Simulation against Twitter screenshots. Anything to not quote nonfiction books. No author name, no links, no thought-out analysis quoted. Just perpetual rounds of mocking back and forth with junk images of South America and other image trash. Fiction storytelling with low-effort commenting. Media addiction now runs USA society, flocking to MAGA mindsets on Reddit.

* Twitter entertainment screenshots for Reddit audiences. “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, when **cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act...” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

Totally this. They don't give a fuck about feelings, they care about their bottom line, and if they make the social media news about being heartless, they'll take note. 

Nothing ever seems to work until you publicly shame.

Same thing happened to me. I had a miscarriage but kept getting emails about my baby's development and offers for Enfamil. 

I even went in to see my obgyn a year later and the first thing he said when he walked in was, "Congratulations." I said, "What for?" He said, "Didn't you have a baby?" I said, "No, I lost it." He was mortified and very apologetic, but clearly someone didn't mark it on my file correctly.

Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.” It was something of an underestimation.

Addiction to the exciting thrilling sports entertainment, online high-speed punishment and reward via money and living rent-paid in minds. Billionaires control the audience, puppet people to worship the Elon Musk / Murdoch / Trump / Putin leaders (all multi-billionaires).

I personally worked for the richest people in the entire world in Bellevue Washington, year 1996. NBA team owner, I was part of the owner's representatives in purchasing / takeover of NFL Seattle Seahawks. Having access to the owner's inside research and planning was very eye opening how "The Little Guy" in the audience is delivered big content. Apps empire, Dreamworks film empire, music producer empire / Jimi Hendrix museum, NFL, NBA, brain study institution,  fleet or private jets and private cruise ships, private homes all over the world. Wired World. People are deeply programmed from childhood to prize the branding and owners of their players.

Audiences eat the "Trickle Down Content" from billionares. People think economic money is "Trickle Down", but it is images of Trump and images of sports assets that trickle down. All highly manipulated by public relationships industry.

My personal favorite class of non\-voters are the twats who abstained from voting or even in some cases voted for Trump over Gaza/Palestine. 

One of the stupidest self\-owns I have ever seen. I get genuinely angry every time I think of the 2024 US election, pisses me right off that we're all in this mess.

Also "the black woman laughed too much". Say what you will about "Biden should have dropped out earlier" and whatever else you want to say, your choice was status quo vs literal criminal, rapist monster and people fucked it up. 

American exceptionalism, domestic and foreign propaganda, as well as media illiteracy has REALLY done a number on the US.

MAGA is less than 50 percent, MAGA is the hate target of Reddit. Non-MAGA is the hate target of Facebook. It's all media vs. media. Fox News vs. MSNBC. Russia seeded every group to hate each other. Surkov won since March 2013. Subreddit vs. subreddit. ANYTHING to avoid hard serious nonfiction learning of Kremlin methods and media ecology.

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

Ya, I'm not sure that a few people on reddit speak for half the country. Of course he lost some supporters. You're never going to get every single person on your team.

This is, unfortunately, the only thing that has a chance of saving you. 

You CANNOT vote your way out of this one. 

Democracy was built on the blood of countless aristocrats, and by blood it must be defended. 

Or you *will* be under the heel of fascism for the next 50 years at least. 

It's either deal with this *now*, or civil war, and guerilla warfare for years to come. 

You will also *need* representatives that will prosecute the traitors (like ICE agents) HARD. If they are left to foment, you will have the same issues again and again later down the road. That's if you're even able to get power back to the people. This also includes going after the media that made this possible. You cannot have media moguls in consolidated corporations that controll the news. 

The reason, for example, that we have so little neo nazi activity here in Norway, is not that we're Social Democrats and so god damn progressive that people just don't become radicalized. It's because we executed the Norwegians who joined the Nazis and worked for them during the occupation. 

You might have heard of Quisling. His betrayal was so enormous that his name became synonymous with "traitor" all over the world. He was executed.

New York City and Chicago combined have more than double the population of your entire country. Then there are about 335 million more people here after that. You're the size of Montana. It's a great idea but we are, unfortunately, just far too big for comparison. It's by design. It won't work here. 

It's also a country of people saying "WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING" from their bedrooms because they're too comfy to be the ones to do it.


:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
The "something" to do never seems to address that a Television star, an addict to television and Twitter, uses media systems. Trump did not take over this nation with guns, brainrot is the problem. People bitch and bitch about Facebook behavior and Fox News behavior, but will not be serious about nonfiction learning about media systems. Professor Marshall McLuhan, Professor Neil Postman not being taught on Reddit and Bluesky. People do not stand up for education, they do not organize with intellectual teaching of adults.

The posting says how is it supposed to be joy. People flock to billionaire sports game owners, video game creators, Trump amusement. People will not face up to their addiction to unimportant and non-essential entertainment. Humans can live without television and video games and discuss nonfiction serious matters.

i want back my rocking chairs,

cockroaches.

i’ve donated bibles to thrift stores

(mashed them in plastic trash bags with an acidic himalayan salt lamp—

dumbed\-down, easy\-to\-read, parasitic kind):

remember more the slick rubber smell of high gloss biology textbook pictures; they burned the hairs

inside my nostrils,

\& salt \& ink that rubbed off on my palms.

under clippings of the moon at two forty five AM I study\&repeat

```
at the IHOP on the corner of powers and stetson hills—

i repeated \& scribbled until it picked its way \& stagnated somewhere i can’t point to anymore, maybe

my gut—

maybe there in\-between my pancreas \& large intestine is the piddly brook of my soul.

it’s the ruler by which i reduce all things now; hard\-edged \& splintering from knowledge that

used to sit, a cloth against fevered forehead.

can i let them both be? this fickle faith and this college science that heckles from the back of the

classroom

```
           now i can’t believe—

           that the bible and qur’an and bhagavad gita are sliding long hairs behind my ear like mom

```
used to \& exhaling from their mouths “make room for wonder”—

all my understanding dribbles down the chin onto the chest \& is summarized as:

life is merely

to ovum and sperm

and where those two meet

and how often and how well

and what dies there.

Standing up against ALL HATE in ALL PLACES is not a concern. Russia has mind-fucked the population into such predictable patterns of media addiction. The entire point of "Black Lives Matter" is this behavior. The entire planet, all of Earth, is being terrorized by meme addicts / one nation that will not confront horrific smartphone and television **cults and addictions**.

I'd like to point out this guy is a member of BORTAC, Border Patrol's elite tactical unit. The fact that they were even in Minneapolis to begin with supports the theory that Trump told agencies to ramp up aggression in hopes of retaliation.

I'm increasingly thinking you're right. The Trump administration seems to be full of accelerationists who want to provoke civil conflict to justify fully breaking the established order. Every provocation is worse than the last, because they are trying to push the limits intentionally, to see what the breaking point is (if any) for any non\-brainwashed American.

The Media. Reddit "The Media" social has been online for over two full decades. Denial of current year 2026 reality abounds on Reddit. As if they are in an echo-chamber / filter-bubble that a Reddit sustained protest would not be covered globally. World Wide Web, WWW, denial itself. As if it is January 1988 and Reddit hasn't been created yet and it's only Slashdot and Fark. So many low-effort commenting thought patterns programmed into Reddit community hive mind.

On Reddit, people call you "mentally unwell" if you disagree with the current year 2026 situation on New Years weekend. People on Reddit get you silenced and shut up, masked moderators and owners, who cover up such removal of messages and people banned from discourse for standing up against mass dehumanization technology billionaire values (Murdoch billionaire, Trump, Putin billionaire, Musk billionaire, all get prized coverage on Reddit social). Hive minded Reddit society with no-identity, masked like I.C.E. that mob mentality / cult programming to Putin media rules. Surkov won since March 2013.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Russia>

I keep pointing this out because American's get it in their head that everyone must have shitty healthcare, but literally every other country even 3rd world ones have free or very affordable healthcare. 

Conservatives a month or so ago were saying people from Guatemala were invading America to get take advantage of our healthcare. I'm like, you morons, Guatemala has free healthcare. How about a real terrible war torn nation like Somalia? Ya free healthcare.

Its really JUST the USA at this point. Even the poorest countries have this figured out. Partly because the more people you cover with healthcare, the cheaper it gets, so even poor countries figured out "well just cover everyone then?" 

The thing with American healthcare is certain people get rich on it. And you can't have free or very affordable healthcare, while people are getting rich off it.

:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Similar to the street gangs on Reddit social and their behavior. They get in your face, call you a "bot", dehumanize you, call you "mentally unwell" - when you say that Fox News HDTV is the very *billionaire cause* of your mental unwellness as a everyday USA citizen. Communicate that **Musk Twitter and Truth Social have sickened every mind around you** in January 2026 - the street gangs of Reddit organized bullying come after you to get your comments removed. Right in the public Reddit streets, with secret masked moderators who don't reveal names and faces or public logging of their disappearing / removal of persons and comments.

:::::: RoundSparrow Commentary: ======
Look at how technology thirsty the meme addicts of United States of America have become over new technology to come out of billionaires. Sports gamers, video gamers, gaming, anything to avoid nonfiction serious learning from Marshal McLuhan about media addiction / screen addiction mob mentality.

A nation of 0.34 billion conquest of the planet of 8 billion people for tech love! FIFA gaming fandoms / gamers with the "FIFA Peace Prize" have tossed out Pluribus Latin learning of July 4, 2026 in favor of rectangle sports square mindsets. June 11 to July 19, 2026 - USA, FIFA billionaire owners rule USA audience of Reddit and Bluesky. Trickle down sports medical science stars for entertainment!

I used to work for gaming leader Microsoft co-founder at Paul Allen Group / Vulcan Northwest, Inc in Bellevue. Richest people in the entire world. 1997. NFL owner, NBA owner, apps games empire platform. DreamWorks films. https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/19950320/2111216/paul-allen-gives-dreamworks-a-boost **This is all a Elon Musk / Truth Social / Rupert Murdoch living January 2026 nightmare nation of Reddit media addicts** - the most technical-minded, gaming programmed, sports game addicts chasing the tech addictions and FIFA symbolisms that the billionaires developed! I was an inside analyst 8 to 10 doors down from richest people in the entire world... I worked as advisor on media systems, social networking. What a nightmare that has been fed into Reddit society. Worship the F1 teams, worship FIFA, worship NBA, worship NFL. Paul Allen organized it all with Microsoft technology. ESPN. https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1115/6412186a.html The fucking shit I witnessed with richest men in the world and ESPN media! https://archive.NYTimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/0617starwave.html

The burnout of audience minds is very real. Neil Postman was very correct in 1985 book, 1992 book. Such mob mentality burnout of USA society at hands of sports-owners, "Entertainment" Fox News HDTV since year 1996, Reddit hive mind, Musk Twitter hive mind, Facebook Mark Z hivemind, Putin Internet Research Agency mental insurgency since March 2013. All a cluster-fuck of mind-fucking, FUBAR nation USA! "FIFA Peace Prize World Cup" overlay of July 4, 1776 / 250 years. What symbolism mind-fucking by the billionaire media empires! Sports technology, sports medical technology, sports media relations technology to audiences.

* “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology." ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, **year 1992**

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

* “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. No recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit...
