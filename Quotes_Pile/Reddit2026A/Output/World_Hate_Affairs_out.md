It's exactly what Putin wants and has been trying to do for some time.

Top-voted Twitter-length comment. This is where free time and spare time is spent. Low-effort "The Media" of Reddit, people are not asserting important details and names of players / timelines. Just living in a land of short commenting as *social engagement* to Trump Putin Kremlin White House behaviors. This is not resisting, this is play by play audience spectatorship detachment. Sports mentality, sprots-think. People don't say they want to *stop what is happening* and cite nonfiction books, instead high-speed messaging engagement is to make thro-away commenting on it like the weather today might rain for an hour at 2:00pm. Passive and non-resisting, We The People are using spare time this way. Diluting important assertions with time spent on no-citation non-educational filler non-nutritional commenting.

yes. The faith in { amusement, entertainment, sports games, video games, mockery, hate, feedback loops, gaming, gamers }. We could be building a REAL "Ready Player One" society in Columbus Ohio and other inexpensive areas, but instead we get Bluesky and Reddit with zero self-awareness. People *settle for* shit relationships with sugar-daddy Trickle Down junk images and content from the rich and famous billionaires.

1/3 of us are on some bullshit and 1/3 didn’t give a shit enough to vote.

Edit: some of you are right in that there was more to it than voter apathy. I made a general statement out of frustration. It still sucks that a lot of people have the mentality of “well they both suck so I’m not going to vote.” It’s part of the overall problem here in the US.

The faith that it is only a tiny amount of terrorists in Palestine or Pakistan. Makes the whole nation a terrorist nation when people don't actually educate out of terrorists Mosque / terrorists Newsmax / terrorist subreddits / terrorist Facebook training camp / terrorist Fox News HDTV programming of audience minds. 

USA society will not face up that Quran, Bible, Torah, Book of Mormon, L Ron Hubbard are ALL science fiction storytelling. And Truth Social is a fiction-based media venue, as is Reddit a fiction-based media venue. Fiction addiction runs the USA society now. Science thinking and nonfiction abandoned.

Venezuela. Before the Americans kidnaped their president and declared themselves to be in control of the oil wealth, the Russian Federation benefited from the trade relationship it had with Venezuela.

Russia used to do lucrative business with the Venezuelan oil industry, now one of their few remaining reliable sources of foreign currency is gone.

Trump is a useful idiot for Putin. That is all he is.

As an American who immediately recognized Trump for what he is and what he represented, I have been screaming from the roof tops since 2016 at what would come next. 

I had hoped when Biden was elected that Trump would be held accountable, or at the very least barred from ever being able to return to office. 
Sadly, between ignorance and corruption, far too many chose to bring him back. I see countless people online blaming the rest of us “anti\-Trump” Americans for letting this happen and I get so discouraged. The rest of the world sees Americans like me as complicit in what’s happening as if somehow we could stop this.

To you who believe this, what you have me do? 

The truth of the matter is America has over 340 million people and you’d need at least a third of them to step up to stop this. Greed and apathy run rampant. In retrospect, our country has actively sought the de education of our populous. There are many who may be good people at heart but are programmed to believe Trump is their savior. I can share my perspective but those other Americans have to WANT to listen. They have to WANT a differing perspective and unfortunately, until something bad happens to them, they cannot be woken up. 

To the rest of the world, I am sorry. Some of us are doing what we can, but I’m afraid what’s been set in motion cannot be stopped at this point because it will take something terrible to wake up the others. I won’t give up but I’d be lying if I told you I wasn’t deeply demoralized by what I’m witnessing here.

Classic long-form Reddit commenting, not Bluesky-length. Alas: no author name, no book title, no URL off-Reddit, no quote from a nonfiction book. People prize Reddit commenting all on scattered different pages and threads within the page. Anti-Wiki, Anti-FAQ, anti "getting on the same page" of critical important topics in favor of commenting.

The US forgot that it derives an enormous part of its long\-term strength from being the world reserve currency and its geopolitical influence. If it isolates itself and antagonizes everybody, it will lose much of its strength, especially as its rivals pick up the pieces.
