"crazy". The entire relationship audience has with entertainment is now based on the speed of delivery. Audience member, men who go to work together, are in competition with each other to find out first the breaking news about a physically dominating 20 year old symbol of success and "winning" in society. The media system fragments ideas compulsively to feed different mindset, different entry points into the information meme-chain to the point of origin.

The shared parasocial relationship co-workers share at the office or in other workplace settings is based on routines and interpersonal rituals of consumption of an every refreshed set of young men to feed into the system.

I worked for the owner of the Portland Trailblazers (NBA) sports team and was a social media analyst. It was truly eye opening watching the richest men in the world feed the information systems empire of the world.  I was there 8 to 10 doors down from Paul Allen's office in 1996 when this took place https://www.Wired.com/1996/12/starwave-scores-online-nba-broadcast-rights/ - how a media empire owner bachelor, the richest men in the entire world in Bellevue Washington, were thinking about computer operating systems to control the population with sports-thinking and sports mentality. 

This billionaire society operating system out of Redmond, Mercer Island, Bellevue was entirely anti Great Seal of the Unite States of America. A legendary black man's music was the founding of a museum development by white men. The arrangement of symbols and players and content distribution was beyond anything religion clergy or politicians were doing at the time in year 1996. I was still a young man, only age 27, I did not comprehend much of what I was witnessing. It was not until I had lived overseas in Arica, Chile ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos_de_Arica ) and had experienced the fandom from a noon-USA sport cult systems. It was surreal living there at the time of a Star Wars film release and going to an opening night - and witnessing the hotel an press activities of sports players.

The way a society media system operates over sports clubs. And my wife in Africa was also a translator of languages for the World Cup as a home-office worker. As much as any religion or ritual in life, the behavior people have towards these super-human male athletes and seeing how the billionaire owners arrange the information systems.

My mind is blown as I read this simple Reddit comment and witness the topic of the state murdering and gang violence on the streets of the MidWest.

* "We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can’t be told because they transcend thought. **The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can’t be thought about**. The third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field of reference to what is absolutely transcendent." - Power of Myth, year 1988

I will probably never be able to describe what I witnessed in 1996 at age 27. Paul Allen saw computer operating systems of sport fandoms much the same way, and was able to yield wealth and power behind the scenes that could bend any person's childhood symbolism more than any religion clergy. In the 1990' white men were running the world, the computer industry was almost entirely white males from top to bottom. While  I was born in Georgia in the context of Dr. Martin Luther King jr in 1969, I was the only member of my family (who were all born in Ohio, mother / father / both my brothers) to take seriously what Georgia's Jimmy Carter had to say about religion and society operating systems reformations.

SAP, where I worked earlier, was a Unix TCP/IP shop. We had to add TCP/IP to Windows 3.0 and 3.1 desktops, I was automating the installation for dozens of the highest-end laptops for the sales staff and the training centers. SAP's growth was explosive. We were establishing the American Airlines training center at DFW for extremely high-profit corporate teaching as we could not build teaching classrooms fast enough in all our USA cities.

Packet-switching networking ideas were being taken by Paul Allen and applied to sport information delivery. Paul Allen's Wired World of sports, rock mucks (Jimi Hendrix being front), space development, DreamWorks films and Hollywood private jet and private crusade ship fleet for actors / actresses / Hollywood insiders. 

**What a mess, I can't even compose an outline of all the junk this one comment triggers.** The Context blindness and hyper-context experience of Paul Allen's autism. Micro-context vs. macro contest. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caetextia

1995, Carl Sagan spelled out packet-switch information behaviors. fragmented information:

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

REPEATING the key of what this Reddit comment is saying: "The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming" - Carl Sagan, page 59, year 1995

Apply that observation to ICE...

D.O.G.E. Elon Musk year 2025... https://www.Wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/ the age. I could barely grasp what Paul Allen was doing in 1996 with unlimited resources and time to research at the HQ office when I was age 27. And I had HUGE experience working for Telos Federal Systems as an apprentice at age 16, running a hot rod PC shop, creating social media sites and selling them commercially at age 16, etc. Published author.. all before I left Fort Wayne. And then to work for the financially most powerful software company in Europe... 

In 1996 / 1997, Paul Allen had doubled his financial wealth. https://www.deseret.com/1997/9/29/19336980/gates-wealth-doubles-to-39-8-billion/ - the richest people in the world were hitting it like nobody ever had in history with systemic thinking. Bill Gates could have sent any employee in the entire company over to co-founder buddy Paul Allen's office in November 1995, but Microsoft Consulting sent me. Nobody else wanted to take on an upgrade of pre-release Microsoft Exchange Server social media server upgrade sot production release. And then I was hired as a direct employee of Vulcan Northwest. ANYONE could have been hired for that job, the richest most connected computer people i the world, and they hired an outsider who had never been to Seattle before. I had a background from the IBM OS/2 and Vax/VMS and SAP R/3 Unix side of the industry that almost nobody in the Microsoft Bellevue / Redmond circles had.  I had zero industry insider connections, my father was into Pepsi soda business. Even now in 2026, I still get my mind blown of what I saw in year 1996 from the top of Pal Allen Group HQ. I was on the team to integrate the Seahawks purchase, I went and interviewed the team coach to make sure players were connected with the Wired World via owner private internal social media systems.

Context assertion again:

* "We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can’t be told because they transcend thought. **The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can’t be thought about**.
