I was still a young man, only age 27, I did not comprehend much of what I was witnessing. It was not until I had lived overseas in Arica, Chile ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos_de_Arica ) and had experienced the fandom from a non-USA sport cult systems.

Paul Allen saw computer operating systems of sport fandoms much the same way, and was able to yield wealth and power behind the scenes that could bend any person's childhood symbolism more than any religion clergy. In the 1990' white men were running the world, the computer industry was almost entirely white males from top to bottom. While  I was born in Georgia in the context of Dr. Martin Luther King jr in 1969, I was the only member of my family (who were all born in Ohio, mother / father / both my brothers) to take seriously what Georgia's Jimmy Carter had to say about religion and society operating systems reformations.

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Bill Gates could have sent any employee in the entire company over to co-founder buddy Paul Allen's office in November 1995, but Microsoft Consulting sent me. Nobody else wanted to take on an upgrade of pre-release Microsoft Exchange Server social media server upgrade sot production release. And then I was hired as a direct employee of Vulcan Northwest. ANYONE could have been hired for that job, the richest most connected computer people i the world, and they hired an outsider who had never been to Seattle before. I had a background from the IBM OS/2 and Vax/VMS and SAP R/3 Unix side of the industry that almost nobody in the Microsoft Bellevue / Redmond circles had.  I had zero industry insider connections, my father was into Pepsi soda business. Even now in 2026, I still get my mind blown of what I saw in year 1996 from the top of Pal Allen Group HQ. I was on the team to integrate the Seahawks purchase, I went and interviewed the team coach to make sure players were connected with the Wired World via owner private internal social media systems.

Mods removed the last thread because the OP intentionally picked out the worst parts of the quote, and nobody bothered to watch the video to call it out, it's still not a very good quote for someone from Minnesota, but it's definitely MUCH MUCH better than what the other OP made it sound like

Edit: this was the title of the previous thread that got deleted

Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Haha I'm from Glasgow and the two big "soccer teams" here Celtic and Rangers have a fierce and violent rivalry going back 100s of years. When I go abroad to Turkey there is a Celtic themed bar that plays anti Rangers songs and stuff which gets everyone all riled up. All the fans love the Turkish dude who owns the bar thinking he is a hardcore Celtic fan \- little do they know he also owns the rangers bar 10 minutes away doing the exact same thing.

In 2011, he published The Machine and the Giant, a story exploring themes of power and management, followed by the short story Without Sky (2014), a science fiction allegory often cited by Western analysts to explain his "non-linear warfare" strategy.

I think it's fascinating that Nicki was so big and seemed to be everywhere, but once other female artists came up (many due to her influence) she fell from grace by not supporting them. Similar to Trump, if you're not praising her then you're her enemy. But unlike Trump, she goes harder on women than men since she centers her life around them.

We know her brother was convicted of horrific crimes, those she aligned herself with were charged with horrific crimes. She married a man who was also convicted and has made her public life worse. But because she centers men over herself, she doesn't care. Which is crazy to me, because the entertainment business is filled with horrible people, but they're horrible people who put themselves and their career first. The fact that she put her husband's crimes over her career when she's the breadwinner is just wild. 

Now she has no choice but to beg Trump so her husband can get his record clean. It's sad. She's always been a bad person, but throwing away everything for a man who can't even go to the park is insane.

Nicki . . . . Girl you fucked up BIG TIME.

I followed you when you were on the streets of Queens, New York until you made it big, hell I even saved up money to attend your concert in DC two years ago and here you are fucking all of that up by supporting a man who hates everything you are.

You're a woman, You're Black, you're an immigrant, you're married to a convicted felon, you're a rapper . . . . . . Republicans hate all of those things so for you to sit there and go from the most talented female rapper of the past 26 years to a right\-wing grifter is not a flex, it's pathetic.

I genuinely thought you were smarter than this but you've proven once again that not all skinfolk are kinfolk.

Post Title:      Actress Natalie Portman "What Trump and Kristi Noem and ICE are doing to our citizens and to undocumented people is outrageous"  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
The misogyny in these comments should not be welcome in this sub.

Mark Ruffalo, also an actor, spoke with emotion and was praised. Natalie Portman gets choked up and sheds a few tears and suddenly she’s just ‘acting’ or shedding ‘crocodile tears’.

How very not [r/justgalsbeingchicks](/r/justgalsbeingchicks) energy.

Post Title:      FBI Raids Georgia Election Office as Trump Expands Attack on Democracy  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
My predictions as someone who’se been right about everything so far except the speed and intensity: 

* As they [have done and attempted to do already](https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/trump-election-monitors-california-new-jersey-legal-rcna240313), they’re going to send their private militia into Democratic states to “monitor” the elections. That’s why they’re doing a $100 Million [“Wartime Recruitment” Campaign targeting military and firearms enthusiasts](https://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/2/headlines/ice_plans_100_million_wartime_recruitment_campaign_targeting_military_and_firearms_enthusiasts).
* Despite this and despite their attacks on voting rights and infrastructure, Democrats will sweep midterms in a lot of places
* This [new US attorney position (who will be head of “fraud” and will report directly to the White House](https://archive.ph/ZKnBf)) will announce that there has been election interference. They’ll release a report that says there was election interference/irregularities in swing states and blue states
* Trump and his minions will pick up the story and run with it. [I mean, Trump himself thinks he’s the most popular president of all time. He will be legitimately confused and angry when the reds get trounced, and as a narcissist \- will refuse to accept the results and lash out (as we’ve seen before)](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115939860152214301)
* The base will amplify it and support it (duh)
* Mike Johnson will "in the name of ensuring our elections are fair and free” \- refuse to seat the Democrats. Until the “irregularities have been fully investigated."
* SCOTUS and the judiciary will slow walk lawsuits from Democrats

Boom, democracy has fallen. mmfw

Edit: Adding some links to sources and more info below.

* Reminder that [over 200 congressional Republicans have still refused to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the 2020 election](https://archive.ph/H3X0B)
* Trump has installed someone into the vice presidency who was picked solely because A. [he said he would not have certified the 2020 election like Pence did](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-defends-trump-claims-invoking-jean-carroll/story?id=106925954) and B. [He's a Palantir corporate crony](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/17/g-s1-11654/five-things-to-know-about-jd-vances-connections-to-tech-billionaires).
* The administration [has installed 2020 election deniers in federal roles responsible for overseeing election integrity.](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/26/trump-loyalist-who-pushed-false-election-claims-takes-on-government-role)
* The House [just passed the Save Act, which would disenfranchise millions of Americans (particularly women)](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-would-disenfranchise-millions-of-citizens/).
* The Supreme Court is [currently hearing a case that is expected to gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965, effectively greenlighting racial gerrymandering](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/voting-rights-act-faces-near-death-experience-us-supreme-court-2025-10-18/).
* [Adelita Grijalva was the trial run for delaying the swearing in of duly elected congresspeople](https://azmirror.com/briefs/johnson-sets-record-refusing-to-swear-in-adelita-grijalva-for-36-days-after-she-won-election/)

And, in recent news, see [Bondi's extortion letter to Tim Walz demanding voter rolls in exchange for removing ICE from the state](https://archive.ph/o7sxW) and the [FBI raid on the Fulton County, GA election office](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/28/fbi-raid-georgia-elections-trump-2020-00753249).

Edit 2: Some additional commentary to address some points people are bringing up about the capacity of the admin to *physically* interfere with elections. 

They don't need to station an army at every polling place. They just need to scare away enough voters to tip the election even more in their favor. The plan to subvert upcoming elections is a complex, multilayered strategy. 

This is why these ICE raids in the lead\-up to the election are so important. That's why they've been arresting thousands of citizens and legal residents.

It's to create an environment of fear among voters who aren't white. 
Do not make the mistake of assuming these people are incompetent 100% of the time or in everything they do. This corpo\-Christo\-fascist movement has been setting the stage for something like this for decades.

This was all planned by plenty of competent (albeit evil) people. This is part of the reason why it's so hard for the public to stay informed on this issue and why a lot of people don't realize how deep in the k\-hole we already are. In addition to what I already mentioned: 

* As on January 2026, they have fired over 100 immigration judges and replaced them with JAGs who have zero immigration experience
* As of January 28, 2025, they have violated a minimum of 100 federal immigration court orders
* As of July 2025, they were violating a third of the federal court orders against them

Quote ::: We are not machines; feeding our quest for knowledge and defining our existences online delivers a synthetic fulfillment that is fleeting and unsustainable. Seeking such satisfaction via the Internet is like trying to quench thirst by sipping water from a fire hose. By drinking from the Internet’s fire hose, we not only end up still thirsty, but we may get seriously hurt in the process. Because this onslaught of information disallows us from taking the time to truly consider any of it, we open ourselves to believing dangerous and unchecked falsehoods. Both Chun and Stanford University election law scholar Nathaniel Persily (2017) warn of the alarming political consequences of our collective inability to think or verify the truth of what is broadcast online. As Chun (2016) observes, “The Internet … has been formulated as the exact opposite of Barlow’s dream (of an unregulated space for a free marketplace of ideas): a nationalist machine that spreads rumors and lies.” :::

Post Title:      More 'No Kings' protests planned for March 28 as outrage spreads over Minneapolis deaths  
:::::: Reddit User Comment: ======  
For those saying "why so far in advance?" here's why:

Doing it now, you'll get shit numbers. So in response, you say, just do them all the time. That burns people out, gets people annoyed and is inconsistent. So in response, you say, well yeah fascism isn't meant to be convinient. No shit \- to all of that.

You plan it out in advance to get the maximum people involved. People have to take off work (yes, even though its on a weekend). This is a normie protest, to be very widely accessible. This is not the storming the building type of protest.

These protests are designed to be widely attended. The No Kings protests, by themselves, are not going to topple the regime. Don't think that they're supposed to. The real goal of these things is to connect you to the groups that will actually make differences in your community. They're networking events, treat them as such.

If you still have a bone to pick with all this, and you want more action to happen sooner \- good, you should. And you should be making those networking connections to your local groups if you haven't yet. They're probably organizing something for this Friday.

What's happening this Friday 1/30, you ask? If you haven't heard, it's a shutdown moment in solidarity with MN \- don't support the economy the entire day. Then the next day, Saturday 1/31, is more local small\-scale protests, maybe focusing on various things. What things? I don't know, ask your local groups.

> how are people thinking this video is real?

It helps them to justify their feelings

1. I don't like black people because I've lived in a white bubble my entire life
2. Obama is black
3. Donald Trump is not
4. I therefore like Donald Trump
5. People are saying bad things about Donald Trump, which makes me feel bad for liking him
6. I'm gonna like him even harder, maybe buy some merch and hang a giant flag on my truck
7. People are now saying bad things about me, which makes me feel bad, so now I'm gonna say bad things about them too
8. Repeat the previous 3 steps, with increasing intensity
9. I'm now so invested in this cult of personality that I'm at a point where I will ignore logic, reason, and my own eyes and ears, should Donald Trump or any of his fellow politicos tell me; my entire personality now revolves around support for the regime
10. Anything that anyone says or shows me that goes against the regime is a personal attack against me; anything that supports the regime angers the people I don't like (read: everyone who doesn't support the regime) and this makes me feel good, so I'll accept it (see nos. 5\-7 above)

Even if Democrats win all three this will never happen. Everyone of these people will walk away with no consequences. One, maybe two will become the fall guys. Everyone else will keep doing the same thing.

What needs to happen is what should have happened after the Civil war. Every single thing they own is taken. All of their money, assets, all seized. They should be given the median annual wage and anything else goes directly to restitution. Anyone who is convicted doesn't get 20 years of appeals. This is treason, it's 2 years and the firing squad. If this doesn't have major repercussions their children will try again in 20\-40 years. 

The heads of the propaganda networks need their empires dismantled and charges brought against them. Every Republican and some Democrats need jail time or banishment from ever holding anything resembling a government position. Even your local county librarian. 

The U.S. should go on statement that Propaganda from a foreign nation, interference into affairs to stoke tensions and create internal conflict is an attack on the country and will be met with force. Foreign country troll farms targeting the U.S. will get one warning then a missile takes the trolls out.

A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers.

I dont really understand going back to The Big Lie. ttump was in charge in 2020\. why didn't he stop the election fraud if there was any? also lost over 50 lawsuits about it. my guess is hes looking for another angle because Minnesota didn't go all Fort sumter like he had hoped.

They probably ID'd him, leading to the gang up, with the intent of putting a good beating on him. Classic bully bullshit. And one of their bully boys took it to the next level and murdered Pretti, thinking once they found a gun that they had all the justification required to delete this man.

All of this is a distraction.

**It is illegal to execute a disarmed and subdued civilian. That is murder.**

Even if someone had an illegal gun and shot at ICE (which didn't happen), it would still be illegal to execute them after they were disarmed and subdued. All other details are irrelevant. There are mass shooters who are handled better than this, and he was not at all a mass shooter.

**Any gov't official who defends executing a disarmed and subdued civilian should be removed.**

In a sane country apologies would be made and investigations started in how to make sure this never happens again. Charges against the officers would be laid. Instead, the gov't are defending the killers which indicates that they plan on encouraging more executions.

I just learned an interesting fact at work yesterday (I'm a scientist at a biotech company): 

Measles virus infection has the ability to wipe out the body's immune memory, weakening its response to other diseases. This means unvaccinated individuals can become vectors for the proliferation of multiple infectious diseases simultaneously! 

Isn't that a fun fact?

Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

This is the 3rd angle to come out. [The 2nd angle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2TRbFmutrw) was posted 13 days ago, 8 days *before* the shooting.

It's 1000% not AI.

I'll always mention though that this does not change the fact Alex Pretti was executed in the streets for protecting two women from being assaulted. If anything, it proves he wasn't going to pull his gun, and agents pinning him down in almost an identical situation did not fear for their lives.

It’s insane to me that they had 6\+ officers there. They could’ve detained him. They already had him disarmed. They already had him on the ground.

You can’t tell me this wasn’t murder. 

You can tell me all day that he wasn’t being “smart” but that does. Not. Matter. It does not change that he was murdered.

100% genuine. 

Here is a vid on YouTube posted 13 days ago (so well before the murder):

[https://youtu.be/p2TRbFmutrw?si\=y24CCfJw6U1VnMKL](https://youtu.be/p2TRbFmutrw?si=y24CCfJw6U1VnMKL)

The events shown in OPs vid occur around 17 mins in. 

It should be obvious but I'll say it nonetheless, even if this is him in the vid above, getting into scuffles with ICE while armed, he did not deserve to die. No excuse.

Hip hop ain't the fuck what it was. 
Most of the hot rappers are popstars.

Kxng crooked (good vs evil 1 \& 2\) is heat though.

There are other artists who have made tracks about it, but they just aren't well known.

Capitalism has watered the game down.

Old head here:  
 Hip Hop, punk, and metal were all anti\-establishment back in the day. But money wins every time. Punk became Pop Punk. Hip Hop became the dominant form of Pop music.

And once Hip Hop mainstreamed, the game was changed. You can't appeal to white suburban mall kids (and all their disposable income) and also be truly anti\-establishment. 

That said, it's not just hip hop. The arts in general lost their anti\-establishment ways. The internet meant everyone could get a following and a following would meant money and people don't mess with their money stream. 

Capitalism y'all. It wins. And it supports the powers that be and it crushes opposition.

The reason this photo is such a provocation is that it suggests that the cold war doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is no longer going to deter either the USA or Russia from using nuclear weapons.

The result of this will be that a whole bunch of America's former allies are going to start building their own nukes. They would be foolish not to do so now that the USA has lost its fucking mind.

When will people wake up 

He’s totally compromised \- the US is a Russian state.
It was the same in UK. Boris was a Russia asset and when that failed they’ve been pushing reform UK.

Russia is winning
The west is losing 
Putin’s Cold War is almost won

The final act is when the midterms are cancelled, or just simply faked

What a normal Human being thinks: 

Why do you associate with a War criminal who is on a genocidal conquest to illegally wage attack wars to take land by force and erasing existence, culture and identity of Ukraine and cause endless suffering.....

The timeline continues to get dumber. I expect in a couple of months he will have the Secretary of Agriculture propose watering plants with Gatorade because electrolytes is what they crave.

The dollar has lost 11% of it's value in 12 months. Somehow, in the same time, the trade deficit doubled. How is that even possible? Typically, when the dollar loses value the trade deficit declines as american goods become cheaper internationally.

> Imagine alienating your allies

It's only going to get worse. The Greenland war threats were a wake up call for Europe. Europe woke up one morning and realized basically all IT infrastructure they use was U.S. based, such as AWS, CloudFlare, and lots of others could be shut off overnight by a single fascist American president. They have no other alternatives because the U.S. was always a reliable partner. They now realize we are no longer reliable nor a partner. 

European companies will be moving away from all U.S. based services. It won't happen overnight as new infrastructure needs to be built but with the threats of war from trump Europe is now done with the entire U.S. tech economy. All of Silicon Valley is done globally, they don't know it yet but they will no longer be the go\-to for the rest of the world. Thanks trump.

When you drain a real swamp, water quality, fisheries, and the resiliency of natural and human systems to man\-made and natural disasters all suffer.

When you drain "the swamp" of our federal bureaucracy, by removing a bunch of technical experts and installing incompetent (edit: and often morally bad) leaders over those who remain, basically the same thing happens to the institutional capital of the executive branch.

These horrible, mentally disturbed people trying to make excuses like "Well, the left rejoiced at Charlie Kirk's death so it's fair game."

News flash: Unlike Charlie Kirk, Alex Pretti actually contributed to the world in a meaningful, positive way and spent his literal last moments in the defense of others. For comparison, Charlie Kirk's literal last words were racism.

“We all know what those whistles are used for” What’s that? Making noise and mildly annoying ICE agents? Is that supposed to be this terrible thing?

The crazy thing is that the bar is so low. They want people to be scared to say anything at all so they go after everybody for expressing any support. They’re trying to create a 2 tier society where there are rules for supporters and non supporters. Supporters can show up with a gun at a protest, they can humiliate the opposition, if they have a uniform they can pepper spray people just for fun, there is no limit to their first amendment rights. While non supporters can’t express any kind of support, they can’t even tell someone else their rights without being branded a terrorist if only by words (for now), they can’t film with their phone or blow a whistle without the fear of being detained. We’re seeing it slowly getting worse, it’s by design.

I checked out the actual post, and the nurse was threatening to not use anesthesia on a patient if they figured out they were conservative.

So in this case, it's a valid firing. I've worked in healthcare before, although I wasn't a nurse, and you should treat people regardless of their political ideology.

The nurse said some completely disgusting things. You are supposed to uphold an oath to save people, regardless of your feelings.

He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. **“Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week?** Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

I have a feeling they’re going to fabricate votes and identities to make it seem like he actually won, technically making it his consecutive term. The administration will sue and argue to a point where the SCOTUS will grant him this now third term for some sort of injustice.

Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be [Howdy Doody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody)." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

Not true. 

X and Facebook are propaganda sites which specifically targeted white youths to radicalize.

They spread common nazi propaganda for years and years.

Andrew tate and Joe Rogan got paid to spread right wing lies instead of the truth. 

Maga’s been doing their version of education for decades and it worked. 

School/College is for liberals and internet hate and jesus is for conservatives.
