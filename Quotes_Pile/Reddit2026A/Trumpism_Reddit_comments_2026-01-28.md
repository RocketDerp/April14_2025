"crazy". The entire relationship audience has with entertainment is now based on the speed of delivery. Audience member, men who go to work together, are in competition with each other to find out first the breaking news about a physically dominating 20 year old symbol of success and "winning" in society. The media system fragments ideas compulsively to feed different mindset, different entry points into the information meme-chain to the point of origin.

The shared parasocial relationship co-workers share at the office or in other workplace settings is based on routines and interpersonal rituals of consumption of an every refreshed set of young men to feed into the system.

I worked for the owner of the Portland Trailblazers (NBA) sports team and was a social media analyst. It was truly eye opening watching the richest men in the world feed the information systems empire of the world.  I was there 8 to 10 doors down from Paul Allen's office in 1996 when this took place https://www.Wired.com/1996/12/starwave-scores-online-nba-broadcast-rights/ - how a media empire owner bachelor, the richest men in the entire world in Bellevue Washington, were thinking about computer operating systems to control the population with sports-thinking and sports mentality. 

This billionaire society operating system out of Redmond, Mercer Island, Bellevue was entirely anti Great Seal of the Unite States of America. A legendary black man's music was the founding of a museum development by white men. The arrangement of symbols and players and content distribution was beyond anything religion clergy or politicians were doing at the time in year 1996. I was still a young man, only age 27, I did not comprehend much of what I was witnessing. It was not until I had lived overseas in Arica, Chile ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos_de_Arica ) and had experienced the fandom from a non-USA sport cult systems. It was surreal living there at the time of a Star Wars film release and going to an opening night - and witnessing the hotel an press activities of sports players.

The way a society media system operates over sports clubs. And my wife in Africa was also a translator of languages for the World Cup as a home-office worker. As much as any religion or ritual in life, the behavior people have towards these super-human male athletes and seeing how the billionaire owners arrange the information systems.

My mind is blown as I read this simple Reddit comment and witness the topic of the state murdering and gang violence on the streets of the MidWest.

* "We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can’t be told because they transcend thought. **The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can’t be thought about**. The third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field of reference to what is absolutely transcendent." - Power of Myth, year 1988

I will probably never be able to describe what I witnessed in 1996 at age 27. Paul Allen saw computer operating systems of sport fandoms much the same way, and was able to yield wealth and power behind the scenes that could bend any person's childhood symbolism more than any religion clergy. In the 1990' white men were running the world, the computer industry was almost entirely white males from top to bottom. While  I was born in Georgia in the context of Dr. Martin Luther King jr in 1969, I was the only member of my family (who were all born in Ohio, mother / father / both my brothers) to take seriously what Georgia's Jimmy Carter had to say about religion and society operating systems reformations.

SAP, where I worked earlier, was a Unix TCP/IP shop. We had to add TCP/IP to Windows 3.0 and 3.1 desktops, I was automating the installation for dozens of the highest-end laptops for the sales staff and the training centers. SAP's growth was explosive. We were establishing the American Airlines training center at DFW for extremely high-profit corporate teaching as we could not build teaching classrooms fast enough in all our USA cities.

Packet-switching networking ideas were being taken by Paul Allen and applied to sport information delivery.

1995, Carl Sagan spelled out packet-switch information behaviors. fragmented information:

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Apply that observation to ICE...

D.O.G.E. Elon Musk year 2025... https://www.Wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/ the age. I could barely grasp what Paul Allen was doing in 1996 with unlimited resources and time to research at the HQ office when I was age 27. And I had HUGE experience working for Telos Federal Systems as an apprentice at age 16, running a hot rod PC shop, creating social media sites and selling them commercially at age 16, etc. Published author.. all before I left Fort Wayne. And then to work for the financially most powerful software company in Europe... 

In 1996 / 1997, Paul Allen had doubled his financial wealth. https://www.deseret.com/1997/9/29/19336980/gates-wealth-doubles-to-39-8-billion/ - the richest people in the world were hitting it like nobody ever had in history with systemic thinking. Bill Gates could have sent any employee in the entire company over to co-founder buddy Paul Allen's office in November 1995, but Microsoft Consulting sent me. Nobody else wanted to take on an upgrade of pre-release Microsoft Exchange Server social media server upgrade sot production release. And then I was hired as a direct employee of Vulcan Northwest. ANYONE could have been hired for that job, the richest most connected computer people i the world, and they hired an outsider who had never been to Seattle before. I had a background from the IBM OS/2 and Vax/VMS and SAP R/3 Unix side of the industry that almost nobody in the Microsoft Bellevue / Redmond circles had.  I had zero industry insider connections, my father was into Pepsi soda business. Even now in 2026, I still get my mind blown of what I saw in year 1996 from the top of Pal Allen Group HQ. I was on the team to integrate the Seahawks purchase, I went and interviewed the team coach to make sure players were connected with the Wired World via owner private internal social media systems.

Yes. And banal Reddit Twitter-length commenting users are not using REAL NAME and REAL FACES. A boot stopping down on faces. No-identity vs. NBA player has REAL IDENTITY known all over society.

* “The misleading effect of books like George Orwell's 1984 is to project into the future a state of affairs that already exists.” ― Marshall McLuhan, The Mechanical Bride : Folklore of Industrial Man. Year 1951

Touch device users don't even have faces on Reddit.

* "Television tries to interpret itself to us, bypassing the upper brain functions and directly feeding into our minds. This is why I said – off camera between classes – that Orwell was a pie-eyed optimist. 1984 arrived in sort of the early 70’s, and ah, Orwell’s vision of a horrible future which was a **boot stomping on a human face forever is a utopian image** because he **assumes there would be resistance and human faces; both of which may turn out to be false.** So, I mean, 1984 is not a book that scares me… anymore. I mean, again, last time I outrageously said that Herbert Marcuse was the Norman Vincent Peale of the 60’s, and now this time I have been forced to say that Orwell was an optimist… you know… it’s sort of my corollary to his little cautionary tale." - YEAR 1993, Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/305-habermas-and-the-fragile-dignity-of-humanity-1993/

# "assumes there would be resistance and human faces; both of which may turn out to be false" - 1993

* As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to **oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions."** In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us. **This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right**.” ― Neil Postman, **Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse** in the Age of Show Business. Year 1985.

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody." ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111
    * Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

In 2011, he published The Machine and the Giant, a story exploring themes of power and management, followed by the short story Without Sky (2014), a science fiction allegory often cited by Western analysts to explain his "non-linear warfare" strategy.

Loyal Trump content fanatics. Cheering on the parading of media stars and entertainers that Trump leads the nation with. Media cults abound. This Reddit meme aficionado gives this particular **POTUS Tony Clifton** absurd surreal comedy skit a 4 out of 4 star rating, "😂😂😂😂" from the Reddit shit-commenting fandom.

Low-thought low-effort short-message Reddit thinking patterns. Entirely unaware that Charlie Kirk has a media cult following, podcast medium cult, and the severe emotional impact of fellow Reddit cultists / media cultists. I call this the Bible verse "1 John 4:20" media crisis; Charlie Kirk in year 2021 created https://PoliticalResearch.org/about/in-the-news/charlie-kirks-turning-point-usa-increasingly-leaning-right-wing-christian the Turning Point USA Faith ("TPUSA Faith") Christian media cult, and Reddit audience member has no education (or perhaps does and has either forgotten or lost comprehension) on comparative mythology. This is why so many Reddit hive-minded individuals can't grasp why Trump has such extreme power over the society using Surkov monomyth screenplay patterns.

So many fanatics of Charlie Kirk's monomyth science fiction storytelling **experience intense anguish and pain at the loss of the prized content** drops. Surkov students are running circle around the Reddit audience. "emotionally upset" - Reddit comment, emotional disturbed, Kirk impacted people extremely deep with the White House and Kremlin TCP/IP amplifications and HDTV amplifications. The video of Charlie Kirk's assassination was extremely thrilling to action violence monomyth fandoms.

It contains a collage of images and text that illustrates the effects of electronic media and new technology on man.

If people would stop using their free time and spare time on Reddit to comment and mock-back at every mockery event ICE / MAGA / Trump White House and Kremlin do, and instead face the media cult of mocking. Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book from October 3, 2017 should be quoted constantly on every media platform until people are educated and understanding.. on the same pages... of removing Trump. Instead, a hate-watching fandom on Reddit had ICE on the front page constantly.

"The misogyny in these comments" ... Is this the reason there is such Reddit social avoidance of promoting woman Jen Senko about brainwashing topic since year 2015 / 2016? Why woman Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book is avoided whenever the topic of mental health, unfit, dangerous comes up about Donald Trump?

* “In Donald Trump, we have a frightening Venn diagram consisting of three circles: the first is extreme present hedonism; the second, narcissism; and the third, **bullying behavior.** These three circles overlap in the middle to create an impulsive, immature, incompetent person who, when in the position of ultimate power, easily slides into the role of tyrant, complete with family members sitting at his proverbial “ruling table.” Like a fledgling dictator, he plants psychological seeds of treachery in **sections of our population that reinforce already negative attitudes**.” ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

ANYTHING to avoid asserting cult deprogramming, Jen Senko's film https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad about brainwashing right-wing media, Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book about mental health of Trump. Just look forward to more sporting events and athlete protesting and don't have a social media intellectual uprising right now today calling for people to get on the same page (Dr. Lee's nonfiction book for public education) and remove Trump.

People are compulsively attracted to Trump's acting, his professional actor talents and content creation. Media consumer population is not using social media to educate and rise up against the nonsense Trump leads. People are normalizing this at hyper speeds.

That's the nation attraction crisis. We The People, the Reddit community, is incredibly attracted to the mocking and trash content. Shit-commenting audience prizing Twitter shit-postings, Reddit shit-posting, shitty Reality TV, shit leadership. People are not using Reddit information systems to remove Trump by asserting Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction teachings, Jen Senko's nonfiction film about right-wing media cults and brainwashing. Audiences on Reddit commenting section have spent day after day, night after night, commenting about Trump family for over a decade.

* Dr. Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President. Published October 3, 2017.Chapter: "Trauma, Time, Truth, and Trump: How a President Freezes Healing and Promotes Crisis" written by Betty P. Teng, M.F.A., L.M.S.W ... Quote ::: We are not machines; feeding our quest for knowledge and defining our existences online delivers a synthetic fulfillment that is fleeting and unsustainable. Seeking such satisfaction via the Internet is like trying to quench thirst by sipping water from a fire hose. By drinking from the Internet’s fire hose, we not only end up still thirsty, but we may get seriously hurt in the process. Because this onslaught of information disallows us from taking the time to truly consider any of it, we open ourselves to believing dangerous and unchecked falsehoods. Both Chun and Stanford University election law scholar Nathaniel Persily (2017) warn of the alarming political consequences of our collective inability to think or verify the truth of what is broadcast online. As Chun (2016) observes, “The Internet … has been formulated as the exact opposite of Barlow’s dream (of an unregulated space for a free marketplace of ideas): a nationalist machine that spreads rumors and lies.” :::

Fiction outsells nonfiction. It isn't just one political party. Thrilling fiction storytelling engages the society that has abandoned nonfiction learning for adults. Nonfiction like Dr. Bandy X Lee's October 3, 2017 book should be quoted constantly on Reddit commenting section, instead it's shit-commenting to shit-postings. Low-effort junk information commenting is prized over serious assertions and thoughtful quotes from a book concerning Trump's mental health. People AVOID sharing links to educate and teach how dangerous the situaiton is: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/

Trump leads with entertainment and constant audience stimulation for the Reddit commenting community. Dr. Bandy X Lee's leadership is to nonfiction comprehension and understandings of the bigger picture... which are consistently avoided by the Reddit population. Amusement and mockery that Trump provides is far more popular. Pop culture of Trumpism is toxic. Popularity itself is toxic. Trump leads all media platforms as the most popular engagement.

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating for Reddit video audiences (/r/LeakedNews gullibility of Reddit audience - it is a deliberate statement, not a "leak"). A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media platform from all over the Internet.

"Really don't understand" why wild and unusual choices get made. On Reddit, the media platform that posts anything unusual or odd on any topic across the entire Internet. People stimulated on Reddit when an unusual animal pet trick is done, when a kitten or cat has a unique color, when any sports player does anything unusual or unexpected, flocking to unusual content. Reddit user unable to grasp Surkov information warfare exploits this very behavior, making Reddit ground zero for distributing Maximum Putinization mindsetting content from Surkov students throughout the society. President Tony Clifton antics and acting gets Trumpism constant mind-blowing (to Reddit audience) content media coverage.

The place is Reddit commenting section. Where all Russia information warfare against NATO gets /r/PoliticalHumor subreddit to humor-washed, mocked away, meme-wrapped, amusement-mocked. Where no-identity garbage commenting is prized above nonfiction book learning. Reddit is a hate-MAGA training camp of *hate harder* messaging and MAGA values. ANYTHING to avoid repeat-until-understood by everyone... nonfiction serious book like Dr. Bandy X Lee on mental health. ANYTHING to avoid repeating content that would actually TREAT and HELP MAGA get out of the Kremlin information warfare simulations that started from the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency in Q2 2013. ANYTHING to avoid sustained focus and *everyone on the same page* of mental health topics, such as: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/

https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1qqdh39/maga_sighs_of_relief/o2g3o2d/

Reddit fandom of ICE content is so engaged! Drama, chaos, ANYTHING to avoid quoting and repeating over and over this nonfiction book:

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the [Plot to Break America, page 85](https://books.google.com/books?id=8OW2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA85&dq=%22serves+as+a+political+uniform.+And+if+you+have+a+uniform,+you+have+an+army.%E2%80%9D&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X). **year 2019**

CONEXT_ASSERTION: year 2019 published book comes before "Project 2025" became the Reddit training camp fixation and focus. The book was not repeated in Reddit commenting back in year 2019 or 2020, January 6 20201, year 2024, etc.

Reddit mind training camp: Truth doesn't matter. Billionaires can use their powerful media systems to **dump anti-reality upon the population**, that doesn't matter. What matters is Twitter-length low-effort short-length commenting messages hour after hour, day after day, all avoiding serious nonfiction books. Avoiding getting on the same page of rescuing MAGA, removing Trump from office, information warfare against NATO, etc. 

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some 20 days ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - we should NOW be [repeating it every 47 hours over and over](https://github.com/GreatSealUSA/Brainrot_Society_47), keep repeating, again and again!

Putin has mind-fucked the population into self-harming the USA and self-harm to NATO. Attacking Canada and Greenland for no good reason. But people are unable to engage serious nonfiction learning in favor of low-effort high-speed "rush speed" commenting on incredibly fast information systems. Surkov won since March of year 2013. Ukraine was the front line February 20, 2014 for a world wide web information war.

On the world stage, USA news sources like CBS, Reddit /r/news look incredibly gullible and easy to manipulate. The entire USA leadership in information sources and reliable information is wrecked. Surkov won.

* “With the rise of Technopoly, one of those thought-worlds disappears. Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992

* “Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992.

1 month Reddit account. Directing the Reddit audience to only mind election day voting, not the Reddit comment voting / social media behaviors of Trump and how it interacts with the social media voting of Reddit comment section. ANYTHING to avoid turning to Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction serious leadership. The low-effort joke commenting that Trump's antis comments about { hockey, China, Canada } create. It puts the USA society focused on commenting and making memes and jokes about Trump. It turns Trump into a constant source of Reddit commenting stimulation. Instead of REMOVING Trump from office, the audience in USA engages the content Trump initiates.

Reply after reply to this message that 1) ignore Dr. Bandy X Lee and will not quote professional nonfiction books on paper. 2) Eating the Surkov onions and think this is dumb. Turning the USA into a source of mockery and humor jokes is the very Surkov technique that blows minds, weaponized humor.

Dementia-washing by Reddit media creators. Surkovian onion eater. See: https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md Predictable short Twitter-length Tweet-think messaging and mindsets.

*  Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. **“Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week?** Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

Someone in Reddit audience suggests that maybe it is intentional. But unable to name Surkov governing techniques.

Most popular comment, upvoted. Twitter-length. Twitter-thinking, simplistic. The cult of Trump media and cult of Putin's anti-NATO "high energy" leadership style doesn't go away. Hitler in Germany went to jail and it only grew his reputation. Trump is a "bad guy" and people have been programmed mentally to seek out bad leadership and self-harm the USA.

Why is social media right now, today, not making Dr. Bandy X Lee a constant topic of assertion... because people are conditioned to seek out low-effort passive-nothing commenting like this top comment on Reddit. Every hour of every day social media users do not call for organised cult deprogramming.

Extreme tiny-short commenting replies "yes, this is fascism". Which is in no way **resisting** it, it's just a declarative mindset. Like an audience member commenting upon a science fiction film about a character's action. People with spare time and free time are attracted to seek out Trump content and antics and comment upon them. This has been going on day after day, year after year, the fandom of Trump antics. The entertainment fandom of Trump leadership.

Anti-forgiveness, *hate harder* messaging, anti-education, ,anti-teaching, anti-learning, anti-progress. Anti-Malala. Anti-MLKjr. Wanting to lock in the MAGA trajectory of worse and worse billionaires like Rupert Murdoch Fox News HDTV, Elon Musk HDTV, Putin's Internet Research Agency - and just let the situaiton keep advancing into more and more self-harm of USA.
