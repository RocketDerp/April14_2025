The abandonment of all inner progress. The cheering on of "I disowned my MAGA neighbors and family" - now the USA has all the attitudes of a terrorist nation. A nation that cheers on terrible shit... a nation without love and forgiveness. I do not say this lightly, I lived in 4 Islamic nations to study the issue.

New York City 9/11 Twin Towers:

1. Trump was a real estate owner and internalized the spectacle of hate leadership with tall buildings. https://www.WashingtonPost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/11/and-now-its-the-tallest-trump-in-otherwise-somber-9-11-interview-couldnt-help-touting-one-of-his-buildings/

2. Trump sold and singed The Bible and posed with The Bible and people are entirely unable to memorize Bible verse Matthew 6:5 in response to Trump. It is the most published book, and people are so bad at reading a science fiction story that nobody can manage to make a popular meme showing Trump with the Bible and the words "Matthew 6:5" on the meme image macro.

3. Celebration of Ignorance

4. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life." - [أسامة بن لادن](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden)
Al-Jazeera interview, (21 October 2001)

5. *The Terrorists Have Won*. Donald J. Trump of NYC is the proof, clutching The Bible book.

It really is sickening that Reddit platform with millions of users has such a literacy and reading comprehension problem that the most printed book people couldn't find page "Matthew 6:5" and put an end to MAGA and Trump. Let alone page "1 John 3:17" and put an end to MAGA and Trump Musk.

People have Google Search on their intimate touching devices. Dumb stupid moron information from television is on the front page of Reddit every hour of every day, day in day out. But with all that information available, Reddit users celebrate ignorance of television so hard that a book o paper nobody bothers to read and remark about page "Matthew 6:5" of the Bible. One fucking sentence that people could hold up to Trump with his Bible posing.

I can't take the anti-book anti-reading celebration of Ignorance that Reddit has done to my nation. One fucking Bible page, Matthew 6:5, and then one more: "1 John 3:17".

Clearly every teacher in the nation has failed. Every education and comprehension lesson didn't work. **Why hasn't Reddit made Matthew 6:5 world famous** in the face of Donald J. Trump... such a failure of reading lessons from teaching organizations. Teachers have taught way too much sports and shit-prizing... and our society... even the most basic applied reading has failed. Sickening.

People stand for nothing good. Four out of five pages in the fucking shitty Bible can suck, but **people can not cherry-pick worth a god damn**. Just because it is a book on paper. It was an open-book test and nobody on Reddit could find one cherry hanging on the entire printed [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil), Matthew 6:5 page.

Vibe politics. Trump gives off "vibe" and "style" that Reddit audiences can not resist. He dominates the minds of Reddit fandom to such a degree that people can no longer read books on paper. The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations. Trump media content is one hell of a drug for Reddit society.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

*In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

*On the other hand, there was also a "negative" magical aspect to Hitler, because he was able to galvanize in a magical fashion the negative projections of dislike, hatred and antagonism from the depths of the unconscious of a very large number of people. He evoked...*

I do not agree with this strategy because the cost and wealth involved in the legal system. It is the everyday man that needs to address the situaiton.

BETTER_ANSWER: Explain Surkov governing of Russia for the past 26 years, how Surkov student techniques work. Surkov should be legendary known name.

If *We The People* can not make the case for nonfiction reality, we will live under mythology has humanity has for all recorded history. The Great Seal of the United States of America "new world order" of reason-thinking scientific mindsets of reality has been lost. The experiment failed. We are back to now wild claims about voting just as Putin runs Russia, mythological leadership (Surkovian).

SEE_ALSO Reddit fell for the ["Big Lie" / "große Lüge"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie) technique, Biblical "Big Troll", I've named: Operation Matthew 4:19 https://GitHub.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md

Tweet-thinking Twitter-style commenting, highly upvoted on Reddit. 

That's one of the huge problem I see with society in the face of serious danger. People *bitching* about Trump talking points and language, but not reaching for articles / citations / references with real author names. For example, I have kept a close eye on one article on The Atlantic since September 16, 2020 ["Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language" By Megan Garber](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/) - as the whole Tower of Babel, media ecology front and center. Alternate reality via language and meaning - that's hard-core Marshall McLuhan (University of Toronto) topic of media ecology. Finnegans Wake... as [in **year 1924 onward publication Woke... Wake** to media, media woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village).

Short message. Twitter-think. Nauseating and sickening media environment of Reddit comment messages where people flock to every Trump video and image and make these Tweet-thinking mindset comments. People who prize and seek out commenting sections on Reddit as the highest and most important source of information, avoiding recognizing the entire nation is nauseating and sickening the whole world with Kremlin information warfare patterns, Surkov monomyth manipulation of executive function in the mind. People on Reddit so engaged with the meme-drug patterns of Putin / Trump and other Surkov students... that they are unable to organize a social media intellectual uprising to promote serious nonfiction learning.

* "As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to **oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions."** In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us. **This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right**.” ― Neil Postman, **Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse** in the Age of Show Business.

"QAnon". Short-length Twitter-thinking comment message on Reddit. Highly upvoted, popular. Calling for murder and execution. Simulation of resistance. In no way does this address the Fox News HDTV media cult and billionaire Rupert Murdoch population mindsets. SEE_ALSO: https://old.reddit.com/r/QAnonRussia/ and how Reddit society can't escape pre-programmed reactionary mindsets and see how Putin organized QAnon promotion and exploitation of USA minds using Reddit meme platform.

Reddit is a Fandom.

Reddit is a rich white men **Celebrity** TV fandom. Donald Trump fandom. https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate-watching Many are attracted to the hate leadership and are Reddit media cultists of hate virtue signaling. The virtue of *hate harder*. Reddit is a fandom of hate leaders and rich white men iconic lifestyles of private jets and secret sex acts. ANYTHING to avoid asserting Malala's October 8, 2013 book and giving young girls the education and voice to speak up against abusive men who rule girls and women. REDDIT COMMENTING COMMUNITY WILL DO ANYTHING but repeat and stay focused in promoting GenX leader Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction public education about the crisis of toxic dangerous leadership in USA. https://www.ScientificAmerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/

Media cult of avoiding nonfiction serious organized focus. **Reddit is a Fandom**. A venue for gatherings of Trump fanatics. Reddit is a mockery-washing platform. Tiny-short 4-word Twitter-think as mentally programmed by { Putin --> Murdoch --> Trump --> Musk }.
