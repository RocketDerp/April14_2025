The abandonment of all inner progress. The cheering on of "I disowned my MAGA neighbors and family" - now the USA has all the attitudes of a terrorist nation. A nation that cheers on terrible shit... a nation without love and forgiveness. I do not say this lightly, I lived in 4 Islamic nations to study the issue.

New York City 9/11 Twin Towers:

1. Trump was a real estate owner and internalized the spectacle of hate leadership with tall buildings. https://www.WashingtonPost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/11/and-now-its-the-tallest-trump-in-otherwise-somber-9-11-interview-couldnt-help-touting-one-of-his-buildings/

2. Trump sold and singed The Bible and posed with The Bible and people are entirely unable to memorize Bible verse Matthew 6:5 in response to Trump. It is the most published book, and people are so bad at reading a science fiction story that nobody can manage to make a popular meme showing Trump with the Bible and the words "Matthew 6:5" on the meme image macro.

3. Celebration of Ignorance

4. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life.

It really is sickening that Reddit platform with millions of users has such a literacy and reading comprehension problem that the most printed book people couldn't find page "Matthew 6:5" and put an end to MAGA and Trump. Let alone page "1 John 3:17" and put an end to MAGA and Trump Musk.

People have Google Search on their intimate touching devices. Dumb stupid moron information from television is on the front page of Reddit every hour of every day, day in day out. But with all that information available, Reddit users celebrate ignorance of television so hard that a book o paper nobody bothers to read and remark about page "Matthew 6:5" of the Bible. One fucking sentence that people could hold up to Trump with his Bible posing.

I can't take the anti-book anti-reading celebration of Ignorance that Reddit has done to my nation. One fucking Bible page, Matthew 6:5, and then one more: "1 John 3:17".

Clearly every teacher in the nation has failed. Every education and comprehension lesson didn't work. Why hasn't Reddit made Matthew 6:5 world famous in the face of Donald J. Trump... such a failure of reading lessons. Teachers have taught way too much sports and even the most basic applied reading has failed.

People stand for nothing good. Every page in the fucking shitty Bible can suck, bu people cam not cherry-pick worth a god damn. Just because it is a book on paper.
