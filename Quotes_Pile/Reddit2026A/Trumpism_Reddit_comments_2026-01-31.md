The abandonment of all inner progress. The cheering on of "I disowned my MAGA neighbors and family" - now the USA has all the attitudes of a terrorist nation. A nation that cheers on terrible shit... a nation without love and forgiveness. I do not say this lightly, I lived in 4 Islamic nations to study the issue.

New York City 9/11 Twin Towers:

1. Trump was a real estate owner and internalized the spectacle of hate leadership with tall buildings. https://www.WashingtonPost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/11/and-now-its-the-tallest-trump-in-otherwise-somber-9-11-interview-couldnt-help-touting-one-of-his-buildings/

2. Trump sold and singed The Bible and posed with The Bible and people are entirely unable to memorize Bible verse Matthew 6:5 in response to Trump. It is the most published book, and people are so bad at reading a science fiction story that nobody can manage to make a popular meme showing Trump with the Bible and the words "Matthew 6:5" on the meme image macro.

3. Celebration of Ignorance

4. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life." - [أسامة بن لادن](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden)
Al-Jazeera interview, (21 October 2001)

5. *The Terrorists Have Won*. Donald J. Trump of NYC is the proof, clutching The Bible book.

It really is sickening that Reddit platform with millions of users has such a literacy and reading comprehension problem that the most printed book people couldn't find page "Matthew 6:5" and put an end to MAGA and Trump. Let alone page "1 John 3:17" and put an end to MAGA and Trump Musk.

People have Google Search on their intimate touching devices. Dumb stupid moron information from television is on the front page of Reddit every hour of every day, day in day out. But with all that information available, Reddit users celebrate ignorance of television so hard that a book o paper nobody bothers to read and remark about page "Matthew 6:5" of the Bible. One fucking sentence that people could hold up to Trump with his Bible posing.

I can't take the anti-book anti-reading celebration of Ignorance that Reddit has done to my nation. One fucking Bible page, Matthew 6:5, and then one more: "1 John 3:17".

Clearly every teacher in the nation has failed. Every education and comprehension lesson didn't work. **Why hasn't Reddit made Matthew 6:5 world famous** in the face of Donald J. Trump... such a failure of reading lessons from teaching organizations. Teachers have taught way too much sports and shit-prizing... and our society... even the most basic applied reading has failed. Sickening.

People stand for nothing good. Four out of five pages in the fucking shitty Bible can suck, but **people can not cherry-pick worth a god damn**. Just because it is a book on paper. It was an open-book test and nobody on Reddit could find one cherry hanging on the entire printed [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil), Matthew 6:5 page.

Vibe politics. Trump gives off "vibe" and "style" that Reddit audiences can not resist. He dominates the minds of Reddit fandom to such a degree that people can no longer read books on paper. The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations. Trump media content is one hell of a drug for Reddit society.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

*In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

*On the other hand, there was also a "negative" magical aspect to Hitler, because he was able to galvanize in a magical fashion the negative projections of dislike, hatred and antagonism from the depths of the unconscious of a very large number of people. He evoked...*

I do not agree with this strategy because the cost and wealth involved in the legal system. It is the everyday man that needs to address the situaiton.

BETTER_ANSWER: Explain Surkov governing of Russia for the past 26 years, how Surkov student techniques work. Surkov should be legendary known name.

If *We The People* can not make the case for nonfiction reality, we will live under mythology has humanity has for all recorded history. The Great Seal of the United States of America "new world order" of reason-thinking scientific mindsets of reality has been lost. The experiment failed. We are back to now wild claims about voting just as Putin runs Russia, mythological leadership (Surkovian).

That's one of the huge problem I see with society in the face of serious danger. People *bitching* about Trump talking points and language, but not reaching for articles / citations / references with real author names. For example, I have kept a close eye on one article on The Atlantic since September 16, 2020 ["Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language" By Megan Garber](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/) - as the whole Tower of Babel, media ecology front and center.

Short message. Twitter-think. Nauseating and sickening media environment of Reddit comment messages where people flock to every Trump video and image and make these Tweet-thinking mindset comments. People who prize and seek out commenting sections on Reddit as the highest and most important source of information, avoiding recognizing the entire nation is nauseating and sickening the whole world with Kremlin information warfare patterns, Surkov monomyth manipulation of executive function in the mind. People on Reddit so engaged with the meme-drug patterns of Putin / Trump and other Surkov students... that they are unable to organize a social media intellectual uprising to promote serious nonfiction learning.

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

No, Trump is not the first. "bizarre" is Surkov governing, Surkovian Russian system of governing. Trump is using Kremlin information warfare methods.

Because of entertainment addicts. Joke addicts who won't turn down the jokes and memes about Trump every hour of every day and night. The joke-washing, the constant Reddit LOL Cow Milking. People will not put serious leaders like Dr. Bandy X Lee at the top of every social media platform and put an end to the Twitter-thinking shit-posting shit-bird shit-commenting Tweet-shit. Little, tiny, 2.5 second media content garbage! Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee not being quoted over and over and over since the release of her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book? Drowned in junk-shit shit-commenting.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

People make a shit-comment on it with Reddit servers, then post a shit-posting, then post a meme about Trump, and keep moving on to the next shit-commenting, over and over and over and over since June 16, 2015.

Left-right brain rot. Badness is prized if it is the other team, us vs. them. This is what Neil Postman was trying to describe about USA culture. People are so addicted to entertainment, they would pick situations for amusement above all else. That's what Surkov students defeated the nation with, this logic that something bad happening is funny content if it s the other team in a team sport mentality. Wrecking the entire world for amusement jokes.

The reply comment about 70% of Americans...

Where is this magical 30 percent of people who are rescuing the USA from Putin's information warfare since March 2013. It is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT who will not face up that this has been about **NATO all along**, no matter how much people see wild and crazy **NATO behaviors over Canada and Greenland**... people still will not sober up from the endless mocking of Trump, joking off Trump... to realize that David Foster Wallace was not joking when he killed himself over the USA society not getting that "Infinite Jest" joking is a real fucking human brain exploit.

This **magical 30 percent of the population** is laughing all day and night at Trump antics. Media addition rules the nation. Russia won! Surkov students won.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action."

The fantasy that 70 of the population an be mocked day in and day out and insulted is fed by billionaires Putin team who manipulates billionaire Rupert Murdoch team who manipulates billionaire Elon Musk Twitter team who all feeds manipulation into the World Wide Web. Billionaire after billionaire purchasing news networks, social networks, information machines to dumb bullshit into the ocean we all get our drinking water from and poisoning the whole god damn ecology. The study of this ecological behavior of human media users is called "Media Ecology", as in Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan students.

What happened is that before year 2007, every person in their far at the traffic light was not staring into an Apple iPhone screen. The smartphone and iPad is what changed the nation. Books on paper and magazines on paper and newspapers n paper is what fucking changed. Trump is first and foremost a icon of childhood television. **New York City Fox News**, New York City Saturday Night Live. The *ART* of the deal is the art of bamboozle and acting, smoke and mirrors, performances, theater, actors doing acting. Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update News" is Fox News promoting comedy. New York City New York University Manhattan Professor Neil Postman. The notification opera of the iPad and iPhone.

1985:

That's why I keep an eye on Malala as a global topic (Malala is trying to help girls in every nation, she went to Atlanta to even help USA girls). Little girls being tear gassed and being shot on school bus in Pakistan. People are raised to be super competitive about education and parenting and don't seem to be concerned about other people's children, except to put Taliban in charge as some kind of competition to harm others.

Fiction addiction. "Peter" from Family Guy fiction addiction. South Park fiction addiction. Reality TV "The Apprentice" fiction addiction. Fox News SNL "Weekend Update" NYC fiction addiction. Joke addictions. Humor and amusement addictions. People lost their minds to memes and joke-cracking shit-commenting shit-posting Internet about President Tony Clifton actor dong acting. Trump sure isn't skilled as a leader of anything but mockery. An actor mocking USA. The problem is the audience every day and night, not just voting days, but upvoting on Reddit shit-commenting days. Fiction addictions.

There is a fundamental thing people do not grasp: In fiction, anything goes. Fiction stories allow all kinds of plot twists, wild and crazy actions. If you can get USA population to tune into social media venues day in and day out and view the White House as a fiction story to watch... anything goes. People are detached from nonfiction.

People do not want to take on the new media problem with WikiTribune because you don't get rich doing news for free. We could be open sourcing all medical knowledge, all medical hardware, all medical drugs, all medical treatment methods in a Super Wikipedia. But people don't believe in admiring the common good... they want to admire exclusive unique assets and real estate that nobody else has. Competition of sports, sports mentality.

Putin did not invade Ukraine because of Epstein files. Hitler didn't start a war because of Epstein files. If the world really cared about young girls, why is Malala group given so little attention... people are so obsessed with Trump's sex life. Trump outright told everyone that being a famous celebrity matters when sexual consent comes out. Rock music stars in the 1970's were doing this more in the open. The Taliban is doing child marriages in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Parents are programming their children to worship Rupert Murdoch and Trump as leaders. 

The foundation being laid here by Reddit programming of minds is that badness has to be about sex. We can have horrible leaders who keep away medical care for decades - that's OK because they didn't have illegal sex acts. Trump needs to be held accountable for ALL BAD, not just what he did out of office in his life, but what he is doing in OUR NAME as a NATION! And it isn't just Donald trump! JD Vance, MAGA congress.

These policies are not distractions from the Epstein list.

Yes. Look at the forest for the trees. People ADMIRE Trump for his sexual domination of girls and women. People ADMIRE Trump for his health care harm. People ADMIRE Trump for his pandemic pro-Russia stance. See: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - the problem is the CULT BEHAVIOR to rich white men. We The People will not turn to authentic good leaders like Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee, or Malala. Instead, people keep commenting over and over and over and over with spare time and free time about Trump! Trump is an irresistible charm that USA people can not stop fixating on.

Trump having power is a symptom of Russian information warfare since March 2013. Trump is a symptom of Reality TV actor acting entertainment addictions! Recency bias, fixation on white older men (Biden, Trump) in USA population.

I'm convinced Neil Postman was correct in year 1985 with his nonfiction book about television news. I am convinced Reddit is the joke-washing mill that embraced Putin's media invasion since March 2013 and has been entertainment drowning USA at large. People will not stand up to hate on Reddit and Bluesky, people promote hate vs. hate, hate for hate, and ignore Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today is Sunday.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

I think Reddit does not want to face up that "love thy neighbor", "love one another" is essential to democracy. Without love and compassion, you get the health care system that the USA has currently - you get manipulated and tricked by Rupert Murdoch using Fox News, you get manipulated and tricked by Putin with the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency.... People can not see that ANTI-NATO anti-LOVE anti-FRIENDSHIPS with Canada, Greenland, EU, etc is exactly what the USA has become.

Fox News runs deeper than Kamala. University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan and NYU's Neil Postman need to be front and center in society recognizing what the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad have done to the population... along with Fox News and Russia's IRA and ... can't forget Cambridge Analtyica. EVERY DAY, ALL DAY not just VOTING DAYS, we are drowning in fiction addictions.

Signs of likely dangerousness due to mental disorder can become apparent without a full diagnostic interview and can be detected from a distance, and one is expected to err, if at all, on the side of safety when the risk of inaction is too great.”

Celebration of Trump leadership. That Trump is leading the USA into more gun worship. With the hate-prizing mass dehumanization worship of machine messaging systems I have seen since Putin's media invasion March 2013 onward... the last thing we need is people who fill their heads with meme fiction armed and promoting "solutions" to problems of spattering brains instead of addressing the Fox News and IRA problems with intelligence and education. Rumors and bullshit off the Internet are how Trump and Putin took power and all that shit now will drive gun conflicts and street gang violence... based on garbage intelligence and bad information.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Pizzagate was fiction storytelling. USA society since year 2013 has abandoned nonfiction serious learning in favor of fiction storytelling content creators like Elon Musk (Twitter), Donald Trump (Truth Social). The media ecology understandings in the society by students and readers of Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman essentially disappeared. Self-awareness to media addiction was left in the past and people are now raging fiction addicts. Fiction sells, so the measure of "good" is that it is popular and draws an audience. Nonfiction **highly relevant** learning from { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, Malala Yousafzai, Peter Pomerantsev, Dr. Bandy X. Lee } have been consistently avoided. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qt3wsk/trump_goes_scorched_earth_and_vows_to_sue_epstein/o3032in/

Yes. it worked. There was no social media protest, no blackout on social media, no stooping of jokes and a "come to God" movement over the Mueller report and impeachments over Russia. People just keep going back to amusements and sports and sports games, video games, everything but staying focused on Putin and Russia. Now Canada is being openly threatened, Greenland, wrecking of NATO. But still, We The People will not stand up on social media in unity and turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

"the Russian Olympic runner who blew the whistle on Russia’s pervasive doping program, Yuliya Stepanova. Either DT is incomprehensibly naïve regarding Putin’s popularity at home — the 82 percent rating was fabricated — or he was swooning from the compliment when Putin called him “bright” (not a “genius,” as DT has bragged ever since)."

"In addition, during the campaign, DT spoke of “fighting for peaceful regime-change” if elected. (America is not ruled by a regime.) He bloviated that he would “blow out of the water” the seven small Iranian boats whose sailors had harrassed and given the finger to our “beautiful destroyers.” He bragged that “Russia and I would get along really well.” He suggested that maybe “the Second Amendment people” might be able to stop Hillary; that his supporters should patrol voting sites to ensure he was being treated fairly, and that he would love to “hit and hit and hit \[his critics from the DNC\] until their heads spin and they’ll never recover.”     

He insisted that he will “bomb the shit out of ISIS” and order our soldiers to kill their presumed families. He repeatedly goaded supporters to rough up hecklers at his speeches and pontificated that NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem should find another country. He quoted Mussolini’s “Better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep,” and he expressed genuine bewilderment about why we build nuclear weapons if we don’t use them.   

In the clinical assessment of such frightening characteristics, why would DT admire grotesque tyrants while never praising our own past presidents"

yes. If We The People wanted hi gone, we would address the very mechanism of Trump and Putin's power over USA. Social media. Stop being entertained and amused by Trump's stimulating content creation and media coverage and all turn to nonfiction books about cult deprogramming. The POPULATION of Trump fandom is the problem. Trump has charmed all media systems to bend to his black hole of Putin's Surkov governing systems.

Yes. Trump is jut ONE SINGLE PERSON. An entire nation is on smartphones commenting and ReTweeting about garbage information. We are all Fox News trash addicts, Reality TV "The Apprentice". The problem is extremely deep and serious. THIS IS NOT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM IN OFFICE!!! Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book has been published since October 3, 2017 and available at any university library or public library! But garbage junk commenting addiction has taken over hearts and minds, Surkov won since March 2013.

WE THE PEOPLE need to RESCUE our own nation from Fox News cult, Newsmax cult, Elon Musk Twitter cult, the word is out that cult followings are the means to power and wealth!!! We can't all be media cultists to horrible leaders as a source of "LOL COW MILKING". Neil Postman's books are not optional learning for every person over age 12 in USA. Marshall McLuhan teaching revival is essential!

Fandom of Trump is meme-washing, "LOL COW MILKING" Trump as a constant source of entertainment and mockery. Parroting MAGA talking points as "jokes", that are not funny, because hundreds of millions of people believe bullshit off of media systems like Reddit social and Fox News HDTV.

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action."

"Delusional". Twitter-length dilution of serious topics.

Reddit fandom of Trump is a fandom of insulting and mocking. Not a fandom of nonfiction quoting experts. Dr. Bandy X Lee since year 2017 has been documenting Trump's mental health for the public. But low-effort commenting has everyone trapped in avoiding nonfiction serious books.

* "When NPD and psychopathy combine, they form a pattern of behavior called malignant narcissism. This isn’t a diagnosis, but a term coined by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and elaborated on by personality disorder expert, Otto Kernberg, to describe people so driven by feeling special that they essentially see other people as **pawns in their game** of kill or be killed, whether metaphorically or literally. Hitler, who murdered millions, Kim Jong-un, who’s suspected of ordering his uncle’s and brother-in-law’s deaths, and **Vladimir Putin, who jokes about “liquidating journalists”** — no doubt all fall in the category of malignant narcissist (among possessing other pernicious traits, like sadism, or delight in hurting others)."

It is not as though the hyperreal could get by without injections of reality in it. It requires – and this is not a principle from Baudrillard but one that I have realised from watching a lot of television – you have to have injections of reality in order to keep the images afloat, occasionally. In fact one of the new, ah, strategies adopted by television – and it serves two functions, one is a cost function – are these reality shows. They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated." https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

My fucking point exactly. **That point is a core fucking point of this GitHub project**. Trump attraction is the outcome of Cambridge Analytica and the Saint Parkersburg Internet Research Agency. Trump is the product of the biggest mental manipulation success in world history. Surkov cracked the monomyth, at least the dark anti-compassion anti-empathy side of the monomyth.

People I have known my entire life, and others I traveled and knew for 10 or more years, suddenly started being attracted to self-harm father figures, daddy issues, masculine garbage. Anti-Malala even among the most intelligent and thoughtful people. Anti-MLKJr. Surkov won.

Short Twitter-length logic of polarity mindsets. "reminder" to mock MAGA in a feedback loop that Russia started since March 2013 with the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency. Constantly mock Americans vs. Americans and ignore all the NATO Ukraine conflicts that Putin has been using to destabilize reality with. Reddit is a fandom of MAGA. "reminder".

USA has morals. Sports stars with armies of medical doctors while fans have no health care or doctor. Expensive name-brand education university sports-team brandings. Anti-Wiki anti-FAQ anti-intellectual copyright and patent restrictions of medicines and knowledge.  Disney into mind, **Mario** into mind of children.

* **YEAR 1993**, children of the 1990's now the adults teaching morality. "I have talked about how children used to learn morality from their parents and now I think that [morality is learned from] Super Mario Brothers. They spend much more time with Super Mario Brothers and are much more emotionally involved with Nintendo than they are with their aunts, their uncles, their mothers and their fathers. I asked one of my children “Why are you yelling at a machine?” when he began to bang his Nintendo, and he looked at me as though I were a being from another world. And because of that there is a postmodern trajectory. I am from another world. I am still, as it were, caught in the modern. He’s not. Why not be emotional with a machine? His peers are machine-like" https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Mocking the obvious of it. But WHY? THERE ARE NO WINNERS WITH TRUMP. MAGA is being HARMED by Trump. The ENTIRE POPULATION OF USA is being harmed by Trump. There are ZERO winners. There are addicts to fame and media content who BELIEVE they are getting a great reward and stimulation from TRUMP, but it's all bullshit. Bullshit upon bullshit! The "winning" is self-harm, THERE ARE ZERO PEOPLE in North America getting any authentic GOODNESS out of Trump being in power and center of all media systems ("The Media", Reddit social, Twitter social, global media, media coverage, etc). Trump is a product of self-harm of media addiction itself!

* "The work was all about trying to anticipate how people would internalize and then spread cultural information — whether that meant in joining a death cult or in choosing a wardrobe. Bannon immediately grasped all of this, even telling me that he believed, as I do, **that politics and fashion are essentially products of the same phenomenon**. It was obvious that he treated intelligence gathering in a broad and deep way, which is not something I’ve seen many people in politics do. And that’s what makes him so powerful. He reads about **intersectional feminism or the fluidity of identity** not, as I later learned, because he’s open to those ideas but because he wants to invert them — to identify what people attach themselves to and then to weaponize it. What I didn’t know that day was that Bannon wanted to fight a cultural war, and so he had come to the people who specialized in informational weapons to help him build his arsenal." ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 4 "Steve From America", page ??, year 2019

The Somehow is called Russia IRA and Cambridge Analytica. Doctors of psychology got it into their minds.

"What Cambridge Analytica observed was that when respondents were angry, their *need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced*. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical **trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits**, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the **Plot to Break** America, page 128, **year 2019**

I don't find The Bible storybook to be any more silly than comparable science fiction such as Hamlet's Ghost or Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghost" voices in Luke's head. What I do find horrific is people who will not stand up to hate since **The 1954 Equation** was introduced.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

No. A popular person with a media following is not real reality in hyper-real Trumpism USA. Reddit media addict who know how to get top-upvote comment no longer can relate to real reality. We are not in the first term of Trump, this is the SECOND term. Real reality is way back in year 2011 or so.

* "They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… **well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality** and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated." - Texan Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1qu6y4y/doj_takes_down_thousands_of_epstein_documents_for/o380i5f/

They haven't "forgot", eating the performance. The whole thing has been an act of information strip tease. Strip poker with the Reddit audience, fandom of Epstein and QAnon PizzaGate fandoms. Why isn't social media promoting Malala and giving girls voices and addressing the foundation problems with global society and how girls are trafficked, treated, abused, married and manipulated by elder men?

The Reddit audience attraction is to commenting upon Trump Epstein content / Putin Kremlin / Trump White House as fast as possible, not focusing on the gullibility and ignorance of the population that is attracted to male "Daddy" Jesus Trump, God Trump, Allah Trump, Allah Yahweh leadership.  PARENTS have elected Trump to be a role model for their 7 year old children. Trump has been the center of all education and teaching systems for a decade. Trump is put in front of every media system over and over and over to stimulate Reddit and other media audiences. The masculine sexual power Putin + Trump has over Reddit adults is sickening.

Trump showing off girls and women for audiences is his profession and skill. What skills do  people think Trump is actually qualified for? November 8, 2013 Trump was in Moscow to show girls images across media systems. That's what he does, that's his gift and talents. Getting an audience. Trump is an actor or follows screenplays and performances for cameras. This is all information strip tease from powerful white men to their fandoms.

Infamous Epstein has a **media cult** fandom.

People will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING but put Dr. Bandy X. Lee and Jen Senko at the center of attention and deal with media brainwashing by billionaires. It is a very sickening society, it make me ill and sick, to see so many people who have never studied or did not comprehend what Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman were teaching and educating the general public about Reddit media systems! The ability to hoard digital data is the message. The Xerox machine, copy machine, is the message. The Epstein private jet is the message. Compulsive media addict behavior is Trump's force over society. Trump is a camera magnet and the audience is in no way self-aware of the Epstein fixation an Trump fixation via information trickle-down from Trump!

And a for "outrage", we don't need more and more raging and outraging - we need people to stop reacting to Epstein / MAGA / Putin / Trump and start teaching nonfiction cult deprogramming. We need to rescue hearts and minds from Russian information warfare outcomes. We are living in an aftermath of Putin's military mental manipulation.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

* “I encounter forms of this attitude every day. The producers who work at the Ostankino channels might all be liberals in their private lives, holiday in Tuscany, and be completely European in their tastes. When I ask how they marry their professional and personal lives, they look at me as if I were a fool and answer: “Over the last twenty years we’ve lived through a communism we never believed in, democracy and defaults and mafia state and oligarchy, and we’ve realized they are illusions, that everything is PR.” “Everything is PR” has become the favorite phrase of the new Russia; my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the **ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated**. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort **of dark joy**, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act. **Surkov himself is the ultimate expression** of this psychology." ― **year 2014**.

* “You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow... But the one great shocking occasion when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, ... never comes. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked ... but of course, this isn't the way it happens. In between comes all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you ... and you see that everything - everything - has changed ... Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed.”
― Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. Published year 1955.

Comedy of SNL NYC President Donald Trump playing Tony Clifton. People allow ANYTHING if you humor-wrap it for Reddit audiences and fandoms of Trump-Surkov comedy leadership. Neil Postman was correct in year 1985. SNL NYC NYU Manhattan Professor.

* "For all his perspicacity, George Orwell would have been stymied by this situation; there is nothing “Orwellian” about it. The President does not have the press under his thumb. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not Pravda; the Associated Press is not Tass. And there is no Newspeak here. Lies have not been defined as truth nor truth as lies. **All that has happened is that the public has adjusted to incoherence and been amused** into indifference. Which is why Aldous Huxley would not in the least be surprised by the story. Indeed, he prophesied its coming. He believed that it is far more likely that the Western democracies will dance and dream themselves into oblivion than march into it, single file and manacled. Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions. Although Huxley did not specify that television would be our main line to the drug, he would have no difficulty accepting Robert MacNeil’s observation that “Television is the soma of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World.” Big Brother turns out to be Howdy Doody."
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, **year 1985**, page 111

* Howdy Doody is an American children's television program (with circus and Western frontier themes) that was created and produced by Victor F. Campbell and E. Roger Muir. It was broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States from December 27, 1947, until September 24, 1960." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howdy_Doody

Top-upvoted comment. Trump fans on Reddit cheering on that more pro-Trump content is dumbing down society. Cheering on the media cults of Donald Trump content. Reddit fans do not want to address the cult problems with cult deprogramming, as that would remove the entertainment an amusements on Reddit that have become core to Reddit social gathering since June 16, 2015 ... **more than decade of Trump fandom gathering on Reddit social for the mockery and celebration of ignorance** via sarcasm-washing of Trump using Reddit commenting. Those who hate Trump are often the most loyal media fans of Trump content and first to make their mark on Reddit fandom center.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Yes. I remember. Just as I remember rectangle sports fields are simple patterns for audiences to follow. And that contact football causes brain damage. How armies of medical doctors support very well paid men to run around inside a rectangle while audience members are controlled by billionaire mental manipulators Paul Allen an Jody Allen - who I worked for at age 27 before I fully realized what they were doing to their customers, their "end-users" of software (being "used"), sports teams, private fleet of jets and cruise ships, DreamWorks film production, music production, Jimi Hendrix museum, etc. And how loyal audiences are to owners of entertainers.

I didn't fully grasp the global significance of my first-hand experience in Bellevue Washington year 1996 to 1999 until year 2008 Austin SXSW and by late 2009 when I predicted the Arab Spring Internet revolution in Africa. Even though I had watched the Power of Myth TV series in 1988 after graduating high school, I didn't realize what I had experienced until year 2009. How sports team owners and media systems of ESPN were being used to manipulate people into predictable thinking patterns towards billionaires. 

* PAUL ALLEN is featured by Lesly & Rebollo in the current
BUSINESS WEEK.  Allen, the third-richest man in the U.S. with
$8B, "always seems somehow out of place, never quite meshing with
his surroundings."  By investing in "at least a dozen young"
media, entertainment, and technology companies" https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Daily/Issues/1996/11/12/Sports-Industrialists/PAUL-ALLEN-THE-MAN-BUILDING-AN-EMPIRE-IN-HIS-QUIRKY-IMAGE/ "Our strategy is to get out
ahead and run like hell. ... This is cable TV in 1980."  BUSINESS
WEEK notes "perhaps Allen's eclectic grab bag of entertainment
properties **will never really make sense to outsiders**."
* * That $8 billion in 1996 doubled to $17 billion in 1997. In 1997, Allen purchased the Seattle Seahawks NFL team for $194 million to prevent the team from moving. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-29-fi-37381-story.html - I was there, 8 or 10 doors down the hallway in 1997, 1998, 1999 as a internal consulting and running the staff social media systems. Billionaires don't just double their wealth in a single year every day. What a high-profile pot of gold I had to secure and watch over.

Didn't make deep sense to me until a decade later... I started revising Marshall McLuhan's 1968 book in year 2009. https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_in_the_Global_Village and Bill Moyer's interview book from 1988. Rectangle Portland Trailblazers court, rectangle Seattle Seahawks court and mindset audience programming of square-wave block-head logic patterns of billionaires controlling. Inside the rectangle thinking. Steve Blamer caught on to Paul Allen's games.

I suggest you let Malala pick young non-billionaire leaders of the girls uprising. 

* "Flanked by 193 young people from around the world—one for each current seat in the United Nations—Malala demanded safety and education for all children. Then she introduced a few of her “sisters”—other young women who are working with the Malala Fund, a non-profit promoting education for girls inspired and led by the young Pakistani activist." - https://qz.com/511657/photos-meet-the-six-incredible-girls-helping-malala-to-educate-the-world

Look around on Bluesky and see how many use #Malala hashtag. People do not give a shit about standing up for girls. Trump and Epstein are FAR FROM the only abuses in a planet of over 8 billion people. Rich and famous Bill Gates name is why this is on top. If Malala had not been shot by a gun, her January 3, 2009 blog would have been ignored by most people. They fucking shot girls on a school bus!

* "On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt"

Listen to Malala speak, she is intelligent and much of what she wrote an said back from January 3, 2009 to year 2014 is recorded and logged. Read her book from October 8, 2013. EDUCATE GIRLS TO STAND UP TO MEN! Give girls power to articulate what the fuck men are doing to  control and corner them!

Why? if someone say "read Hamlet", or "Read Romeo and Juliet" poetry, you think they are morons? I like Star Wars 1977 and I like The Bible and Quran stories from Mohammad. All science fiction storytelling.  I like this new Apple TV+ "PLUR1BUS" science fiction series, it help teach The Great Seal USA Latin meaning.

* “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

"laughable", exactly. That's what Reddit social is for, laughing at MAGA and laughing at Republicans and laughing at Trump day in and day out. Not recognizing the predictable mob mentality of laughing at the out-group as entertainment and amusement addiction. A joke-washing platform, Reddit . com

* “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”
