The abandonment of all inner progress. The cheering on of "I disowned my MAGA neighbors and family" - now the USA has all the attitudes of a terrorist nation. A nation that cheers on terrible shit... a nation without love and forgiveness. I do not say this lightly, I lived in 4 Islamic nations to study the issue.

New York City 9/11 Twin Towers:

1. Trump was a real estate owner and internalized the spectacle of hate leadership with tall buildings. https://www.WashingtonPost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/11/and-now-its-the-tallest-trump-in-otherwise-somber-9-11-interview-couldnt-help-touting-one-of-his-buildings/

2. Trump sold and singed The Bible and posed with The Bible and people are entirely unable to memorize Bible verse Matthew 6:5 in response to Trump. It is the most published book, and people are so bad at reading a science fiction story that nobody can manage to make a popular meme showing Trump with the Bible and the words "Matthew 6:5" on the meme image macro.

3. Celebration of Ignorance

4. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life." - [أسامة بن لادن](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden)
Al-Jazeera interview, (21 October 2001)

5. *The Terrorists Have Won*. Donald J. Trump of NYC is the proof, clutching The Bible book.

It really is sickening that Reddit platform with millions of users has such a literacy and reading comprehension problem that the most printed book people couldn't find page "Matthew 6:5" and put an end to MAGA and Trump. Let alone page "1 John 3:17" and put an end to MAGA and Trump Musk.

People have Google Search on their intimate touching devices. Dumb stupid moron information from television is on the front page of Reddit every hour of every day, day in day out. But with all that information available, Reddit users celebrate ignorance of television so hard that a book o paper nobody bothers to read and remark about page "Matthew 6:5" of the Bible. One fucking sentence that people could hold up to Trump with his Bible posing.

I can't take the anti-book anti-reading celebration of Ignorance that Reddit has done to my nation. One fucking Bible page, Matthew 6:5, and then one more: "1 John 3:17".

Clearly every teacher in the nation has failed. Every education and comprehension lesson didn't work. **Why hasn't Reddit made Matthew 6:5 world famous** in the face of Donald J. Trump... such a failure of reading lessons from teaching organizations. Teachers have taught way too much sports and shit-prizing... and our society... even the most basic applied reading has failed. Sickening.

People stand for nothing good. Four out of five pages in the fucking shitty Bible can suck, but **people can not cherry-pick worth a god damn**. Just because it is a book on paper. It was an open-book test and nobody on Reddit could find one cherry hanging on the entire printed [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil), Matthew 6:5 page.

Vibe politics. Trump gives off "vibe" and "style" that Reddit audiences can not resist. He dominates the minds of Reddit fandom to such a degree that people can no longer read books on paper. The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations. Trump media content is one hell of a drug for Reddit society.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

*In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

*On the other hand, there was also a "negative" magical aspect to Hitler, because he was able to galvanize in a magical fashion the negative projections of dislike, hatred and antagonism from the depths of the unconscious of a very large number of people. He evoked...*

I do not agree with this strategy because the cost and wealth involved in the legal system. It is the everyday man that needs to address the situaiton.

BETTER_ANSWER: Explain Surkov governing of Russia for the past 26 years, how Surkov student techniques work. Surkov should be legendary known name.

If *We The People* can not make the case for nonfiction reality, we will live under mythology has humanity has for all recorded history. The Great Seal of the United States of America "new world order" of reason-thinking scientific mindsets of reality has been lost. The experiment failed. We are back to now wild claims about voting just as Putin runs Russia, mythological leadership (Surkovian).

That's one of the huge problem I see with society in the face of serious danger. People *bitching* about Trump talking points and language, but not reaching for articles / citations / references with real author names. For example, I have kept a close eye on one article on The Atlantic since September 16, 2020 ["Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language" By Megan Garber](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/) - as the whole Tower of Babel, media ecology front and center.

Short message. Twitter-think. Nauseating and sickening media environment of Reddit comment messages where people flock to every Trump video and image and make these Tweet-thinking mindset comments. People who prize and seek out commenting sections on Reddit as the highest and most important source of information, avoiding recognizing the entire nation is nauseating and sickening the whole world with Kremlin information warfare patterns, Surkov monomyth manipulation of executive function in the mind. People on Reddit so engaged with the meme-drug patterns of Putin / Trump and other Surkov students... that they are unable to organize a social media intellectual uprising to promote serious nonfiction learning.

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

No, Trump is not the first. "bizarre" is Surkov governing, Surkovian Russian system of governing. Trump is using Kremlin information warfare methods.

He is not the only one following the Surkov student screenplays. Elon Musk with chainsaw on stage, Musk doing Hitler salute, etc.

Because of entertainment addicts. Joke addicts who won't turn down the jokes and memes about Trump every hour of every day and night. The joke-washing, the constant Reddit LOL Cow Milking. People will not put serious leaders like Dr. Bandy X Lee at the top of every social media platform and put an end to the Twitter-thinking shit-posting shit-bird shit-commenting Tweet-shit. Little, tiny, 2.5 second media content garbage! Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee not being quoted over and over and over since the release of her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book? Drowned in junk-shit shit-commenting.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

People make a shit-comment on it with Reddit servers, then post a shit-posting, then post a meme about Trump, and keep moving on to the next shit-commenting, over and over and over and over since June 16, 2015.

Left-right brain rot. Badness is prized if it is the other team, us vs. them. This is what Neil Postman was trying to describe about USA culture. People are so addicted to entertainment, they would pick situations for amusement above all else. That's what Surkov students defeated the nation with, this logic that something bad happening is funny content if it s the other team in a team sport mentality. Wrecking the entire world for amusement jokes.

The reply comment about 70% of Americans...

Where is this magical 30 percent of people who are rescuing the USA from Putin's information warfare since March 2013. It is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT who will not face up that this has been about **NATO all along**, no matter how much people see wild and crazy **NATO behaviors over Canada and Greenland**... people still will not sober up from the endless mocking of Trump, joking off Trump... to realize that David Foster Wallace was not joking when he killed himself over the USA society not getting that "Infinite Jest" joking is a real fucking human brain exploit.

This **magical 30 percent of the population** is laughing all day and night at Trump antics. Media addition rules the nation. Russia won! Surkov students won.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action."

The fantasy that 70 of the population an be mocked day in and day out and insulted is fed by billionaires Putin team who manipulates billionaire Rupert Murdoch team who manipulates billionaire Elon Musk Twitter team who all feeds manipulation into the World Wide Web. Billionaire after billionaire purchasing news networks, social networks, information machines to dumb bullshit into the ocean we all get our drinking water from and poisoning the whole god damn ecology. The study of this ecological behavior of human media users is called "Media Ecology", as in Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan students.

What happened is that before year 2007, every person in their far at the traffic light was not staring into an Apple iPhone screen. The smartphone and iPad is what changed the nation. Books on paper and magazines on paper and newspapers n paper is what fucking changed. Trump is first and foremost a icon of childhood television. **New York City Fox News**, New York City Saturday Night Live. The *ART* of the deal is the art of bamboozle and acting, smoke and mirrors, performances, theater, actors doing acting. Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update News" is Fox News promoting comedy. New York City New York University Manhattan Professor Neil Postman. The notification opera of the iPad and iPhone.

1985:

That's why I keep an eye on Malala as a global topic (Malala is trying to help girls in every nation, she went to Atlanta to even help USA girls). Little girls being tear gassed and being shot on school bus in Pakistan. People are raised to be super competitive about education and parenting and don't seem to be concerned about other people's children, except to put Taliban in charge as some kind of competition to harm others.

Fiction addiction. "Peter" from Family Guy fiction addiction. South Park fiction addiction. Reality TV "The Apprentice" fiction addiction. Fox News SNL "Weekend Update" NYC fiction addiction. Joke addictions. Humor and amusement addictions. People lost their minds to memes and joke-cracking shit-commenting shit-posting Internet about President Tony Clifton actor dong acting. Trump sure isn't skilled as a leader of anything but mockery. An actor mocking USA. The problem is the audience every day and night, not just voting days, but upvoting on Reddit shit-commenting days. Fiction addictions.

There is a fundamental thing people do not grasp: In fiction, anything goes. Fiction stories allow all kinds of plot twists, wild and crazy actions. If you can get USA population to tune into social media venues day in and day out and view the White House as a fiction story to watch... anything goes. People are detached from nonfiction.

People do not want to take on the new media problem with WikiTribune because you don't get rich doing news for free. We could be open sourcing all medical knowledge, all medical hardware, all medical drugs, all medical treatment methods in a Super Wikipedia. But people don't believe in admiring the common good... they want to admire exclusive unique assets and real estate that nobody else has. Competition of sports, sports mentality.

Putin did not invade Ukraine because of Epstein files. Hitler didn't start a war because of Epstein files. If the world really cared about young girls, why is Malala group given so little attention... people are so obsessed with Trump's sex life. Trump outright told everyone that being a famous celebrity matters when sexual consent comes out. Rock music stars in the 1970's were doing this more in the open. The Taliban is doing child marriages in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Parents are programming their children to worship Rupert Murdoch and Trump as leaders. 

The foundation being laid here by Reddit programming of minds is that badness has to be about sex. We can have horrible leaders who keep away medical care for decades - that's OK because they didn't have illegal sex acts. Trump needs to be held accountable for ALL BAD, not just what he did out of office in his life, but what he is doing in OUR NAME as a NATION! And it isn't just Donald trump! JD Vance, MAGA congress.

These policies are not distractions from the Epstein list.

Yes. Look at the forest for the trees. People ADMIRE Trump for his sexual domination of girls and women. People ADMIRE Trump for his health care harm. People ADMIRE Trump for his pandemic pro-Russia stance. See: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192 - the problem is the CULT BEHAVIOR to rich white men. We The People will not turn to authentic good leaders like Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee, or Malala. Instead, people keep commenting over and over and over and over with spare time and free time about Trump! Trump is an irresistible charm that USA people can not stop fixating on.

Trump having power is a symptom of Russian information warfare since March 2013. Trump is a symptom of Reality TV actor acting entertainment addictions! Recency bias, fixation on white older men (Biden, Trump) in USA population.

I'm convinced Neil Postman was correct in year 1985 with his nonfiction book about television news. I am convinced Reddit is the joke-washing mill that embraced Putin's media invasion since March 2013 and has been entertainment drowning USA at large. People will not stand up to hate on Reddit and Bluesky, people promote hate vs. hate, hate for hate, and ignore Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Today is Sunday.

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* "For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

I think Reddit does not want to face up that "love thy neighbor", "love one another" is essential to democracy. Without love and compassion, you get the health care system that the USA has currently - you get manipulated and tricked by Rupert Murdoch using Fox News, you get manipulated and tricked by Putin with the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency.... People can not see that ANTI-NATO anti-LOVE anti-FRIENDSHIPS with Canada, Greenland, EU, etc is exactly what the USA has become.

Fox News runs deeper than Kamala. University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan and NYU's Neil Postman need to be front and center in society recognizing what the Apple iPhone and Apple iPad have done to the population... along with Fox News and Russia's IRA and ... can't forget Cambridge Analtyica. EVERY DAY, ALL DAY not just VOTING DAYS, we are drowning in fiction addictions.

Signs of likely dangerousness due to mental disorder can become apparent without a full diagnostic interview and can be detected from a distance, and one is expected to err, if at all, on the side of safety when the risk of inaction is too great.”

Celebration of Trump leadership. That Trump is leading the USA into more gun worship. With the hate-prizing mass dehumanization worship of machine messaging systems I have seen since Putin's media invasion March 2013 onward... the last thing we need is people who fill their heads with meme fiction armed and promoting "solutions" to problems of spattering brains instead of addressing the Fox News and IRA problems with intelligence and education. Rumors and bullshit off the Internet are how Trump and Putin took power and all that shit now will drive gun conflicts and street gang violence... based on garbage intelligence and bad information.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

Pizzagate was fiction storytelling. USA society since year 2013 has abandoned nonfiction serious learning in favor of fiction storytelling content creators like Elon Musk (Twitter), Donald Trump (Truth Social). The media ecology understandings in the society by students and readers of Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman essentially disappeared. Self-awareness to media addiction was left in the past and people are now raging fiction addicts. Fiction sells, so the measure of "good" is that it is popular and draws an audience. Nonfiction **highly relevant** learning from { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, Malala Yousafzai, Peter Pomerantsev, Dr. Bandy X. Lee } have been consistently avoided. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qt3wsk/trump_goes_scorched_earth_and_vows_to_sue_epstein/o3032in/

Yes. it worked. There was no social media protest, no blackout on social media, no stooping of jokes and a "come to God" movement over the Mueller report and impeachments over Russia. People just keep going back to amusements and sports and sports games, video games, everything but staying focused on Putin and Russia. Now Canada is being openly threatened, Greenland, wrecking of NATO. But still, We The People will not stand up on social media in unity and turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee's book from October 3, 2017.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

"the Russian Olympic runner who blew the whistle on Russia’s pervasive doping program, Yuliya Stepanova. Either DT is incomprehensibly naïve regarding Putin’s popularity at home — the 82 percent rating was fabricated — or he was swooning from the compliment when Putin called him “bright” (not a “genius,” as DT has bragged ever since)."

"In addition, during the campaign, DT spoke of “fighting for peaceful regime-change” if elected. (America is not ruled by a regime.) He bloviated that he would “blow out of the water” the seven small Iranian boats whose sailors had harrassed and given the finger to our “beautiful destroyers.” He bragged that “Russia and I would get along really well.” He suggested that maybe “the Second Amendment people” might be able to stop Hillary; that his supporters should patrol voting sites to ensure he was being treated fairly, and that he would love to “hit and hit and hit \[his critics from the DNC\] until their heads spin and they’ll never recover.”     

He insisted that he will “bomb the shit out of ISIS” and order our soldiers to kill their presumed families. He repeatedly goaded supporters to rough up hecklers at his speeches and pontificated that NFL players who refuse to stand for the national anthem should find another country. He quoted Mussolini’s “Better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep,” and he expressed genuine bewilderment about why we build nuclear weapons if we don’t use them.   

In the clinical assessment of such frightening characteristics, why would DT admire grotesque tyrants while never praising our own past presidents"

yes. If We The People wanted hi gone, we would address the very mechanism of Trump and Putin's power over USA. Social media. Stop being entertained and amused by Trump's stimulating content creation and media coverage and all turn to nonfiction books about cult deprogramming. The POPULATION of Trump fandom is the problem. Trump has charmed all media systems to bend to his black hole of Putin's Surkov governing systems.

Yes. Trump is jut ONE SINGLE PERSON. An entire nation is on smartphones commenting and ReTweeting about garbage information. We are all Fox News trash addicts, Reality TV "The Apprentice". The problem is extremely deep and serious. THIS IS NOT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM IN OFFICE!!! Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction book has been published since October 3, 2017 and available at any university library or public library! But garbage junk commenting addiction has taken over hearts and minds, Surkov won since March 2013.

WE THE PEOPLE need to RESCUE our own nation from Fox News cult, Newsmax cult, Elon Musk Twitter cult, the word is out that cult followings are the means to power and wealth!!! We can't all be media cultists to horrible leaders as a source of "LOL COW MILKING". Neil Postman's books are not optional learning for every person over age 12 in USA. Marshall McLuhan teaching revival is essential!

Fandom of Trump is meme-washing, "LOL COW MILKING" Trump as a constant source of entertainment and mockery. Parroting MAGA talking points as "jokes", that are not funny, because hundreds of millions of people believe bullshit off of media systems like Reddit social and Fox News HDTV.

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of alternate universes, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action."

"Delusional". Twitter-length dilution of serious topics.

Reddit fandom of Trump is a fandom of insulting and mocking. Not a fandom of nonfiction quoting experts. Dr. Bandy X Lee since year 2017 has been documenting Trump's mental health for the public. But low-effort commenting has everyone trapped in avoiding nonfiction serious books.

* "When NPD and psychopathy combine, they form a pattern of behavior called malignant narcissism. This isn’t a diagnosis, but a term coined by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and elaborated on by personality disorder expert, Otto Kernberg, to describe people so driven by feeling special that they essentially see other people as **pawns in their game** of kill or be killed, whether metaphorically or literally. Hitler, who murdered millions, Kim Jong-un, who’s suspected of ordering his uncle’s and brother-in-law’s deaths, and **Vladimir Putin, who jokes about “liquidating journalists”** — no doubt all fall in the category of malignant narcissist (among possessing other pernicious traits, like sadism, or delight in hurting others)."

It is not as though the hyperreal could get by without injections of reality in it. It requires – and this is not a principle from Baudrillard but one that I have realised from watching a lot of television – you have to have injections of reality in order to keep the images afloat, occasionally. In fact one of the new, ah, strategies adopted by television – and it serves two functions, one is a cost function – are these reality shows. They have realised that we have become, as it were, too intoxicated with hyperreality. With, you know, Kojak and Supercops and so on, so now we just have shows like “COPS“, where you just go to Fort Worth and just film a bunch of cops being cops. That serves a good intelligent economic interest because you don’t pay cops much just for being cops. It’s not that lucrative, and it injects… well is it reality? Well it is compared only to this scale of hyperreality and only under the sign of being whatever can be simulated." https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

My fucking point exactly. **That point is a core fucking point of this GitHub project**. Trump attraction is the outcome of Cambridge Analytica and the Saint Parkersburg Internet Research Agency. Trump is the product of the biggest mental manipulation success in world history. Surkov cracked the monomyth, at least the dark anti-compassion anti-empathy side of the monomyth.

People I have known my entire life, and others I traveled and knew for 10 or more years, suddenly started being attracted to self-harm father figures, daddy issues, masculine garbage. Anti-Malala even among the most intelligent and thoughtful people. Anti-MLKJr. Surkov won.
