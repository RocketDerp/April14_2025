The abandonment of all inner progress. The cheering on of "I disowned my MAGA neighbors and family" - now the USA has all the attitudes of a terrorist nation. A nation that cheers on terrible shit... a nation without love and forgiveness. I do not say this lightly, I lived in 4 Islamic nations to study the issue.

New York City 9/11 Twin Towers:

1. Trump was a real estate owner and internalized the spectacle of hate leadership with tall buildings. https://www.WashingtonPost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/11/and-now-its-the-tallest-trump-in-otherwise-somber-9-11-interview-couldnt-help-touting-one-of-his-buildings/

2. Trump sold and singed The Bible and posed with The Bible and people are entirely unable to memorize Bible verse Matthew 6:5 in response to Trump. It is the most published book, and people are so bad at reading a science fiction story that nobody can manage to make a popular meme showing Trump with the Bible and the words "Matthew 6:5" on the meme image macro.

3. Celebration of Ignorance

4. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life." - [أسامة بن لادن](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden)
Al-Jazeera interview, (21 October 2001)

5. *The Terrorists Have Won*. Donald J. Trump of NYC is the proof, clutching The Bible book.

It really is sickening that Reddit platform with millions of users has such a literacy and reading comprehension problem that the most printed book people couldn't find page "Matthew 6:5" and put an end to MAGA and Trump. Let alone page "1 John 3:17" and put an end to MAGA and Trump Musk.

People have Google Search on their intimate touching devices. Dumb stupid moron information from television is on the front page of Reddit every hour of every day, day in day out. But with all that information available, Reddit users celebrate ignorance of television so hard that a book o paper nobody bothers to read and remark about page "Matthew 6:5" of the Bible. One fucking sentence that people could hold up to Trump with his Bible posing.

I can't take the anti-book anti-reading celebration of Ignorance that Reddit has done to my nation. One fucking Bible page, Matthew 6:5, and then one more: "1 John 3:17".

Clearly every teacher in the nation has failed. Every education and comprehension lesson didn't work. **Why hasn't Reddit made Matthew 6:5 world famous** in the face of Donald J. Trump... such a failure of reading lessons from teaching organizations. Teachers have taught way too much sports and shit-prizing... and our society... even the most basic applied reading has failed. Sickening.

People stand for nothing good. Four out of five pages in the fucking shitty Bible can suck, but **people can not cherry-pick worth a god damn**. Just because it is a book on paper. It was an open-book test and nobody on Reddit could find one cherry hanging on the entire printed [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil), Matthew 6:5 page.

Vibe politics. Trump gives off "vibe" and "style" that Reddit audiences can not resist. He dominates the minds of Reddit fandom to such a degree that people can no longer read books on paper. The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations. Trump media content is one hell of a drug for Reddit society.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

*In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

*On the other hand, there was also a "negative" magical aspect to Hitler, because he was able to galvanize in a magical fashion the negative projections of dislike, hatred and antagonism from the depths of the unconscious of a very large number of people. He evoked...*

I do not agree with this strategy because the cost and wealth involved in the legal system. It is the everyday man that needs to address the situaiton.

BETTER_ANSWER: Explain Surkov governing of Russia for the past 26 years, how Surkov student techniques work. Surkov should be legendary known name.

If *We The People* can not make the case for nonfiction reality, we will live under mythology has humanity has for all recorded history. The Great Seal of the United States of America "new world order" of reason-thinking scientific mindsets of reality has been lost. The experiment failed. We are back to now wild claims about voting just as Putin runs Russia, mythological leadership (Surkovian).

Tweet-thinking Twitter-style commenting, highly upvoted on Reddit. 

That's one of the huge problem I see with society in the face of serious danger. People *bitching* about Trump talking points and language, but not reaching for articles / citations / references with real author names. For example, I have kept a close eye on one article on The Atlantic since September 16, 2020 ["Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language" By Megan Garber](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/) - as the whole Tower of Babel, media ecology front and center.

Short message. Twitter-think. Nauseating and sickening media environment of Reddit comment messages where people flock to every Trump video and image and make these Tweet-thinking mindset comments. People who prize and seek out commenting sections on Reddit as the highest and most important source of information, avoiding recognizing the entire nation is nauseating and sickening the whole world with Kremlin information warfare patterns, Surkov monomyth manipulation of executive function in the mind. People on Reddit so engaged with the meme-drug patterns of Putin / Trump and other Surkov students... that they are unable to organize a social media intellectual uprising to promote serious nonfiction learning.

ANYTHING to avoid asserting Malala's October 8, 2013 book and giving young girls the education and voice to speak up against abusive men who rule girls and women. REDDIT COMMENTING COMMUNITY WILL DO ANYTHING but repeat and stay focused in promoting GenX leader Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction public education about the crisis of toxic dangerous leadership in USA. https://www.ScientificAmerican.com/article/the-shared-psychosis-of-donald-trump-and-his-loyalists/

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

No, Trump is not the first. "bizarre" is Surkov governing, Surkovian Russian system of governing. Trump is using Kremlin information warfare methods. Trump is an actor, acting, his constant performances charm people into addiction to constant stimulation of his show... mockery and insulting. He is not the only one following the Surkov student screenplays. Elon Musk with chainsaw on stage, Musk doing Hitler salute, etc.

Because of entertainment addicts. Joke addicts who won't turn down the jokes and memes about Trump every hour of every day and night. The joke-washing, the constant Reddit LOL Cow Milking. People will not put serious leaders like Dr. Bandy X Lee at the top of every social media platform and put an end to the Twitter-thinking shit-posting shit-bird shit-commenting Tweet-shit. Little, tiny, 2.5 second media content garbage! Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee not being quoted over and over and over since the release of her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book? Drowned in junk-shit shit-commenting.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

People make a shit-comment on it with Reddit servers, then post a shit-posting, then post a meme about Trump, and keep moving on to the next shit-commenting, over and over and over and over since June 16, 2015.
