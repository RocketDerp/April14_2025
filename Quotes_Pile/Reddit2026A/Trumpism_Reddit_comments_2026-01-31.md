The abandonment of all inner progress. The cheering on of "I disowned my MAGA neighbors and family" - now the USA has all the attitudes of a terrorist nation. A nation that cheers on terrible shit... a nation without love and forgiveness. I do not say this lightly, I lived in 4 Islamic nations to study the issue.

New York City 9/11 Twin Towers:

1. Trump was a real estate owner and internalized the spectacle of hate leadership with tall buildings. https://www.WashingtonPost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/11/and-now-its-the-tallest-trump-in-otherwise-somber-9-11-interview-couldnt-help-touting-one-of-his-buildings/

2. Trump sold and singed The Bible and posed with The Bible and people are entirely unable to memorize Bible verse Matthew 6:5 in response to Trump. It is the most published book, and people are so bad at reading a science fiction story that nobody can manage to make a popular meme showing Trump with the Bible and the words "Matthew 6:5" on the meme image macro.

3. Celebration of Ignorance

4. "I tell you, freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life." - [أسامة بن لادن](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden)
Al-Jazeera interview, (21 October 2001)

5. *The Terrorists Have Won*. Donald J. Trump of NYC is the proof, clutching The Bible book.

It really is sickening that Reddit platform with millions of users has such a literacy and reading comprehension problem that the most printed book people couldn't find page "Matthew 6:5" and put an end to MAGA and Trump. Let alone page "1 John 3:17" and put an end to MAGA and Trump Musk.

People have Google Search on their intimate touching devices. Dumb stupid moron information from television is on the front page of Reddit every hour of every day, day in day out. But with all that information available, Reddit users celebrate ignorance of television so hard that a book o paper nobody bothers to read and remark about page "Matthew 6:5" of the Bible. One fucking sentence that people could hold up to Trump with his Bible posing.

I can't take the anti-book anti-reading celebration of Ignorance that Reddit has done to my nation. One fucking Bible page, Matthew 6:5, and then one more: "1 John 3:17".

Clearly every teacher in the nation has failed. Every education and comprehension lesson didn't work. **Why hasn't Reddit made Matthew 6:5 world famous** in the face of Donald J. Trump... such a failure of reading lessons from teaching organizations. Teachers have taught way too much sports and shit-prizing... and our society... even the most basic applied reading has failed. Sickening.

People stand for nothing good. Four out of five pages in the fucking shitty Bible can suck, but **people can not cherry-pick worth a god damn**. Just because it is a book on paper. It was an open-book test and nobody on Reddit could find one cherry hanging on the entire printed [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil), Matthew 6:5 page.

Vibe politics. Trump gives off "vibe" and "style" that Reddit audiences can not resist. He dominates the minds of Reddit fandom to such a degree that people can no longer read books on paper. The "vibes" that transmit across TCP/IP packet networks right into the brain of Reddit consumers to turn them into slaves of Trump-thinking vibrations. Trump media content is one hell of a drug for Reddit society.

NONFICTION BOOK QUOTE FOLLOWS:

*In my view, Hitler had a sorcery, but it was of a different nature than what Ravenscroft implied. There were two factors involved in the kind of sorcery that Hitler represented. One, that might be called in a sense positive, was the sorcery of Hitler's magical personality. Hitler was one of those charismatic individuals who was capable of infusing large numbers of people with ideas and convictions which under ordinary circumstances they would have resisted. There is absolutely no doubt that this was so. He had a tremendously magical personality, who at the same time was personally unprepossessing.* ***He was by no means handsome, but rather shabby and scrawny in appearance, with a voice that was not particularly sonorous or euphonious and with a command of the German language which was anything but cultured. He spoke German with an Austrian accent, and a rather vulgar one at that.*** *There was very little in the man that would recommend him to the public. Yet, once he got on the platform, shouting and screaming in a fashion that would have caused an audience to walk out under other circumstances, he enthralled and convinced and magically transformed people in the most astonishing fashion. This was the result of what one may call the "positive" force emanating from Hitler.*

*On the other hand, there was also a "negative" magical aspect to Hitler, because he was able to galvanize in a magical fashion the negative projections of dislike, hatred and antagonism from the depths of the unconscious of a very large number of people. He evoked...*

I do not agree with this strategy because the cost and wealth involved in the legal system. It is the everyday man that needs to address the situaiton.

BETTER_ANSWER: Explain Surkov governing of Russia for the past 26 years, how Surkov student techniques work. Surkov should be legendary known name.

If *We The People* can not make the case for nonfiction reality, we will live under mythology has humanity has for all recorded history. The Great Seal of the United States of America "new world order" of reason-thinking scientific mindsets of reality has been lost. The experiment failed. We are back to now wild claims about voting just as Putin runs Russia, mythological leadership (Surkovian).

That's one of the huge problem I see with society in the face of serious danger. People *bitching* about Trump talking points and language, but not reaching for articles / citations / references with real author names. For example, I have kept a close eye on one article on The Atlantic since September 16, 2020 ["Do You Speak Fox? How Donald Trump’s favorite news source became a language" By Megan Garber](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/fox-news-trump-language-stelter-hoax/616309/) - as the whole Tower of Babel, media ecology front and center.

Short message. Twitter-think. Nauseating and sickening media environment of Reddit comment messages where people flock to every Trump video and image and make these Tweet-thinking mindset comments. People who prize and seek out commenting sections on Reddit as the highest and most important source of information, avoiding recognizing the entire nation is nauseating and sickening the whole world with Kremlin information warfare patterns, Surkov monomyth manipulation of executive function in the mind. People on Reddit so engaged with the meme-drug patterns of Putin / Trump and other Surkov students... that they are unable to organize a social media intellectual uprising to promote serious nonfiction learning.

And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China.

No, Trump is not the first. "bizarre" is Surkov governing, Surkovian Russian system of governing. Trump is using Kremlin information warfare methods.

Because of entertainment addicts. Joke addicts who won't turn down the jokes and memes about Trump every hour of every day and night. The joke-washing, the constant Reddit LOL Cow Milking. People will not put serious leaders like Dr. Bandy X Lee at the top of every social media platform and put an end to the Twitter-thinking shit-posting shit-bird shit-commenting Tweet-shit. Little, tiny, 2.5 second media content garbage! Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee not being quoted over and over and over since the release of her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book? Drowned in junk-shit shit-commenting.

* “Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning — not just of science, but of anything — are avoidable, even undesirable.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 59

People make a shit-comment on it with Reddit servers, then post a shit-posting, then post a meme about Trump, and keep moving on to the next shit-commenting, over and over and over and over since June 16, 2015.

"Trolls aren't good enough". Gullible Reddit consumer who has not studied Surkovian / Surkov students information warfare since year 2011. Psychological denial abounds, recency bias abounds, people on Reddit have very little sense of how long this Trump situation has been going on, that this is well into the SECOND TRUMP TERM IN OFFICE.

* Second term Project 2025 rose from building on the first January 2017 term in office. “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241

A reality described by Neil Postman in his 1985 book, "Amusing Ourselves To Death".

Shit-posting became the leading information system activity, shit-commenting, an people seeking shit leadership. Enshitification nation. Fox News HDTV bullshit additions were one of the many huge warning signs since 1996, which is 11 years after Neil Postman published his book.

Left-right brain rot. Badness is prized if it is the other team, us vs. them. This is what Neil Postman was trying to describe about USA culture. People are so addicted to entertainment, they would pick situations for amusement above all else. That's what Surkov students defeated the nation with, this logic that something bad happening is funny content if it s the other team in a team sport mentality. Wrecking the entire world for amusement jokes.

The reply comment about 70% of Americans...

Where is this magical 30 percent of people who are rescuing the USA from Putin's information warfare since March 2013. It is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT who will not face up that this has been about **NATO all along**, no matter how much people see wild and crazy **NATO behaviors over Canada and Greenland**... people still will not sober up from the endless mocking of Trump, joking off Trump... to realize that David Foster Wallace was not joking when he killed himself over the USA society not getting that "Infinite Jest" joking is a real fucking human brain exploit.

This **magical 30 percent of the population** is laughing all day and night at Trump antics. Media addition rules the nation. Russia won! Surkov students won.

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 4 months and some weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action."

The fantasy that 70 of the population an be mocked day in and day out and insulted is fed by billionaires Putin team who manipulates billionaire Rupert Murdoch team who manipulates billionaire Elon Musk Twitter team who all feeds manipulation into the World Wide Web. Billionaire after billionaire purchasing news networks, social networks, information machines to dumb bullshit into the ocean we all get our drinking water from and poisoning the whole god damn ecology. The study of this ecological behavior of human media users is called "Media Ecology", as in Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan students.

What happened is that before year 2007, every person in their far at the traffic light was not staring into an Apple iPhone screen. The smartphone and iPad is what changed the nation. Books on paper and magazines on paper and newspapers n paper is what fucking changed. Trump is first and foremost a icon of childhood television. **New York City Fox News**, New York City Saturday Night Live. The *ART* of the deal is the art of bamboozle and acting, smoke and mirrors, performances, theater, actors doing acting. Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update News" is Fox News promoting comedy. New York City New York University Manhattan Professor Neil Postman. The notification opera of the iPad and iPhone.

1985:

* “But it is much later in the game now, and ignorance of the score is inexcusable. To be **unaware that a technology** \[Reddit / Bluesky\] comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple.”

Democracy is every person every day, day and night. Why are social media users not quoting Dr. Bandy X. Lee day and night until Trump is removed?

Trump is an entertainer, an actor acting, and people are covering for their favorite entertainment source. As Reddit demonstrates day in and day out, people hang on every word, Tweet, photograph about Donald J. Trump. The king of high-speed information content creation, king of Pop.

BEEP! Another notification of Trump content on /r/All of Reddit breaking news fandom platform.

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

That's why I keep an eye on Malala as a global topic (Malala is trying to help girls in every nation, she went to Atlanta to even help USA girls). Little girls being tear gassed and being shot on school bus in Pakistan. People are raised to be super competitive about education and parenting and don't seem to be concerned about other people's children, except to put Taliban in charge as some kind of competition to harm others.

Fiction addiction. "Peter" from Family Guy fiction addiction. South Park fiction addiction. Reality TV "The Apprentice" fiction addiction. Fox News SNL "Weekend Update" NYC fiction addiction. Joke addictions. Humor and amusement addictions. People lost their minds to memes and joke-cracking shit-commenting shit-posting Internet about President Tony Clifton actor dong acting. Trump sure isn't skilled as a leader of anything but mockery. An actor mocking USA. The problem is the audience every day and night, not just voting days, but upvoting on Reddit shit-commenting days. Fiction addictions.

There is a fundamental thing people do not grasp: In fiction, anything goes. Fiction stories allow all kinds of plot twists, wild and crazy actions. If you can get USA population to tune into social media venues day in and day out and view the White House as a fiction story to watch... anything goes. People are detached from nonfiction.
