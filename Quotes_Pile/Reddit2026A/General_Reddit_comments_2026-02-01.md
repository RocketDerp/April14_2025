Parents have put their children in front of Fox News. Rupert Murdoch is all over the world teaching men to dominate women. Malala in year 2012 and year 2013 was on the world stage pointing out that anti-women is a global problem. In USA, parents have made Donald Trump the center of all attention and role model for children for over a decade.

Billionaire Elon Musk's Twitter is programming this into boys and girls. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch is programming it into children. Parents are not standing up to this. Billionaire Donald Trump is programming it via Truth Social and widespread global information systems coverage.

We are teaching and educating children to follow Putin and Trump leadership in USA.

If only people could recognize how predictable this pattern of mind-blowing is... Hollywood films are A/B testing of how to blow the minds of obedient actors with mass man mindsets. Actors and actresses, We The People, will do fucking ANYTHING to be on camera, like Donald Trump! Like Hollywood itself, USA on the world stage, addiction to NUMBER ONE SPOTLIGHT HOLLYWOOD FAME!

And for the sake of everyone in the world: Stop believing hate is enjoyable. Stop believing war is fun sport. That killing and murder is rewarding and joyful fun. Stop believing in hate. Stop letting every person around you prize hate leaders and creating a planet with oceans of hate we all share and swim in.

The 1954 Equation.

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

A huge number of Americans think Trump is bad and terrible, "bad bunny Trump", "bad man", and as Vince Gilligan spelled out February 15, 2025... https://Variety.com/2025/tv/news/breaking-bad-creator-vince-gilligan-good-guys-walter-white-1236309604/ Breaking Bad is cool. Walter White is cool. Following hate leaders is popular now.

* Texan Rick Roderick: "And this sense of the sort of hyperreality we get with cinema, we get with television and so on is another phenomenon Baudrillard wants to examine. And I think that here we get – and, I mean, I guess my politics are showing again – but here we get the phenomenon of Reagan, the hyperreal president. More real than real. I mean he’s better at being Harry Truman than Harry Truman. I mean, the distinction about what he is is lost in the hyperreality of his smile, which like the Cheshire Cat’s, you know, just gleams across his face. And we get for the first time a phenomenon never known in polling which is the phenomenon of not liking a person, but of liking liking a person. This is a sign you are dealing with the hyperreal. Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. **When you went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them**. What was popular was his popularity. And I don’t think that Reagan’s alone in this. Show business figures had this same thing go on for years." - https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/
