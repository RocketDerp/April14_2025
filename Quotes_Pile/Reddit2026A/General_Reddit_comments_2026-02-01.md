Parents have put their children in front of Fox News. Rupert Murdoch is all over the world teaching men to dominate women. Malala in year 2012 and year 2013 was on the world stage pointing out that anti-women is a global problem. In USA, parents have made Donald Trump the center of all attention and role model for children for over a decade.

Billionaire Elon Musk's Twitter is programming this into boys and girls. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch is programming it into children. Parents are not standing up to this. Billionaire Donald Trump is programming it via Truth Social and widespread global information systems coverage.

We are teaching and educating children to follow Putin and Trump leadership in USA.

Actors and actresses, We The People, will do fucking ANYTHING to be on camera, like Donald Trump! Like Hollywood itself, USA on the world stage, addiction to NUMBER ONE SPOTLIGHT HOLLYWOOD FAME!

And for the sake of everyone in the world: Stop believing hate is enjoyable. Stop believing war is fun sport. That killing and murder is rewarding and joyful fun. Stop believing in hate. Stop letting every person around you prize hate leaders and creating a planet with oceans of hate we all share and swim in.

The 1954 Equation.

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* Texan Rick Roderick: "And this sense of the sort of hyperreality we get with cinema, we get with television and so on is another phenomenon Baudrillard wants to examine. And I think that here we get – and, I mean, I guess my politics are showing again – but here we get the phenomenon of Reagan, the hyperreal president. More real than real. I mean he’s better at being Harry Truman than Harry Truman. I mean, the distinction about what he is is lost in the hyperreality of his smile, which like the Cheshire Cat’s, you know, just gleams across his face. And we get for the first time a phenomenon never known in polling which is the phenomenon of not liking a person, but of liking liking a person. This is a sign you are dealing with the hyperreal. Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. **When you went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them**. What was popular was his popularity. And I don’t think that Reagan’s alone in this. Show business figures had this same thing go on for years." - https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki social media is a big reason we have billionaires and Trumpism. People need to organize. Alas, it it is mental health of our common connection that is most important. Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 public education people since October 3, 2017 needs to be a WORLD WIDE WEB initiative to cult deprogram Russia and USA. Putin and Trump and Putin and Musk need to be addressed through the teaching and education of Dr. Bandy X Lee. And people need to face the social media behavior of AVOIDING nonfiction authors. Casually calling people { mentally unwell, crazy, batshit crazy, insane, clowns (constant, not just "clowning") } as techniques of { domination, though-terminating, insulting, mocking, mockery, bullying } needs to come to an end. Hate is a threat to all humanity as a viral cult behavior.

So, think about this. Billionaires have programmed the general public to punch down on poor people for their personal expression. Poor people are programmed to insult and mock other poor people.

* “America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death. Year 1969
