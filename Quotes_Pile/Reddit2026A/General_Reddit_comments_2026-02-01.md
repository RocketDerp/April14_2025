Parents have put their children in front of Fox News. Rupert Murdoch is all over the world teaching men to dominate women. Malala in year 2012 and year 2013 was on the world stage pointing out that anti-women is a global problem. In USA, parents have made Donald Trump the center of all attention and role model for children for over a decade.

Billionaire Elon Musk's Twitter is programming this into boys and girls. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch is programming it into children. Parents are not standing up to this. Billionaire Donald Trump is programming it via Truth Social and widespread global information systems coverage.

We are teaching and educating children to follow Putin and Trump leadership in USA.

Actors and actresses, We The People, will do fucking ANYTHING to be on camera, like Donald Trump! Like Hollywood itself, USA on the world stage, addiction to NUMBER ONE SPOTLIGHT HOLLYWOOD FAME!

And for the sake of everyone in the world: Stop believing hate is enjoyable. Stop believing war is fun sport. That killing and murder is rewarding and joyful fun. Stop believing in hate. Stop letting every person around you prize hate leaders and creating a planet with oceans of hate we all share and swim in.

The 1954 Equation.

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

* Texan Rick Roderick: "And this sense of the sort of hyperreality we get with cinema, we get with television and so on is another phenomenon Baudrillard wants to examine. And I think that here we get – and, I mean, I guess my politics are showing again – but here we get the phenomenon of Reagan, the hyperreal president. More real than real. I mean he’s better at being Harry Truman than Harry Truman. I mean, the distinction about what he is is lost in the hyperreality of his smile, which like the Cheshire Cat’s, you know, just gleams across his face. And we get for the first time a phenomenon never known in polling which is the phenomenon of not liking a person, but of liking liking a person. This is a sign you are dealing with the hyperreal. Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. **When you went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them**. What was popular was his popularity. And I don’t think that Reagan’s alone in this. Show business figures had this same thing go on for years." - https://RickRoderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki social media is a big reason we have billionaires and Trumpism. People need to organize. Alas, it it is mental health of our common connection that is most important. Dr. Bandy X Lee's 27 public education people since October 3, 2017 needs to be a WORLD WIDE WEB initiative to cult deprogram Russia and USA. Putin and Trump and Putin and Musk need to be addressed through the teaching and education of Dr. Bandy X Lee. And people need to face the social media behavior of AVOIDING nonfiction authors. Casually calling people { mentally unwell, crazy, batshit crazy, insane, clowns (constant, not just "clowning") } as techniques of { domination, though-terminating, insulting, mocking, mockery, bullying } needs to come to an end. Hate is a threat to all humanity as a viral cult behavior.

So, think about this. Billionaires have programmed the general public to punch down on poor people for their personal expression. Poor people are programmed to insult and mock other poor people.

* “America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain’t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you’re so smart, why ain’t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child’s hand – glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register. Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five. The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death. Year 1969

these subjective tests and measures people are so confident about wreck the lives of autistic people. Every where you go, people think you are not telling the truth base don tone and body language, etc. I've read and heard the same patterns from thousands of people in autism support groups since year 2009. People think people are drunk or on drugs because of motor skill issues, speech patterns, etc. Mentally different people are treated like crap.

Like I've said on this GitHub a few times in the past 10 days... hot girls in my high school would talk to each other in my classroom in front of me. I was a book nerd at age 15 when I was my first year in high school. I would hang out in school just reading alone and I never gossiped or shared rumors. So girls would sit near me and talk to each other as if i was not a threat. I was reading /  studying computer books and other nonfiction. Hot girls in my large high school were not dating other high school boys... they were talking about adult men. I linked the song "Check It Out" John Mellencamp. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qxDBiiVjlQ This was in 1984, 1985, 1986 when I knew the age of these girls in my school classes. age 15, 16. to be a hot girl, you got the attention of powerful men when outside school at the mall or wherever these girls were meeting adult men.

You really wonder if people can't read between the liens about politics and fiction storytelling... if they really can't see what is going on in their own city with Epstein kind of stuff. "i hate that nearly 1/10 18-24 girls have done in America."

These 30 year old men who are manipulating and seducing ate 15 / age 16 girls was going on in front of me in my high school freshman and sophomore class when I knew the age of these girls. 1985, 1986. I really think people don't *listen* to what is going on around them. It isn't just "Epstein island". Powerful and manipulative men treat this as some kind of conquest and sport. The billionaire class in Bellevue, owner of sports empires... the social access that has...

There are some people who don't cover up their age 14 age 15 youth in the music industry and film industry.. I mean you are in front of adults and everyone is looking at you. An attractive / hot person draws influence and power brokers. People like Donald trump are in the Miss Universe in Moscow show. Sports team owners like Paul Allen / Jody Allen... I mean that's their social power over society. the Simpsons make a joke about it... Season 11, Episode 12, "Perks of the International Waters" - but private jets and private cruise ships that billionaires own allow... bypassing a lot of scrutiny.

To me, these discussions I find it impossible to ignore how many parents are feeding their 10, 11, 12 year old children Fox News, Newsmax, and other billionaire-worship indoctrination. Wealth televangelism media systems. People do not understand Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan media ecology. People do not have education in comparative mythology. The cults of Putin, Elon Musk and Donald Trump are very real and raging away as people worship billionaire media systems. These are extremely well financed operations! The biggest advertising and marketing agencies in the world are producing and promoting films like "Melania" 2026 to children as indoctrination. 

People can not face up that the { Upanishads, Bible, Torah, Quran, Book of Mormon, L Ron Hubbard } are all science fiction storytelling. The Bible storybook is 2,000 years old and people still can't find verse "1 John 4:20" and grasp that God is a metaphor, fiction! Hamlet's ghost is fiction. Parents are handing their children over to Truth Social fiction, Russia's Internet Research Agency use of monomyth fiction patterns from The Bible / Quran / Torah.

James Joyce has been in our public library long enough for us to "Wake" to "Finnegans Wake", Woke. MEDIA_WOKE to widespread cults. Putin and Trump are using fiction to run our society like a king and queen claims God endorses their bloodlines. RFK Jr is running our disease control systems (CDC), encouraging anti-science mythological thinking. Fiction storytelling cults. Cults of attractive fiction. Billionaires are leading and creating cults.

SUPER_HYPER_NORMAL "normal" behavior is people following Donald Trump images on /r/All every hour of every day since June 16, 2015. "normal" is hate-based leadership with hundreds of millions of followers. "normal" behavior is parents who have fed Fox News into their children at age 10 and feed Donald Trump as a role model of mature responsible successful leaders... without being alarmed, disturbed, calling for Dr. Bandy X Lee's assembly of 27 mental health professionals in a nonfiction book to be steady topic of everyone on the same page since October 3, 2017 publication. "normal" is the richest people in the entire world gaslighting poor and poorly educated rural with the most powerful media systems ever created by humanity.

QUOTE FROM NONFICTION BOOK FOLLOWS:

Often, people with NPD resort to an insidious strategy called gaslighting — a term drawn from the 1938 play about a man who persuaded his wife she was crazy by, among other means, dimming the gaslights and claiming he’d never touched them. As people with NPD become increasingly psychotic, they’re determined to **convince others that they’re the “crazy” ones who can’t see reality** for what it is. Gaslighting reassures pathological narcissists that their own grip on reality remains firm because they can’t bear to acknowledge their sanity is slipping away. We might ask if we’re seeing this now, as Trump and his closest advisers appear on TV claiming he didn’t make statements that journalists often simply play back — or if **it’s a tweet**, flash an image — to prove that he did indeed say what he said.

Lately, these incidents have become commonplace. Many in the press and public at large now refer to them as alternative facts, alluding to Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway’s now infamous “explanation” for why Sean Spicer had berated the press for misreporting Trump’s inauguration size: “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer peevishly told a stunned press corps. This turned out to be patently false, though Conway defended the statement, saying Spicer had simply been providing “alternative facts.”

Those who **embrace Trump’s reality**, where the mainstream media lies and remains “the enemy,” signify their support with red hats bearing the inscription MAGA (Make America Great Again). Those who believe what the news reports about Trump have donned the symbol of resistance — pink pussy hats, a reference to his now infamous hot mic comments about women, “I just grab ’em by the pussy…”

That the country is currently split — and **our shared reality** with it — seems without question at this point.

People of the SAME RACE can't handle the slightest variation in language expression and mental diversity. The Tower of Babel conflict metaphor is very real and serious. The same race of people fight over different favorite science fiction stories. Catholic vs. Protestant, Fox News fiction vs. Reddit fiction. Alternate universes, alternate alien, based on the media they consume.

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public by way of **alternate universes**, The Fox News cable channel conveys its **version of reality**, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel.

The discussions **consider a loss that Americans don’t have good language for**, in part because the loss itself is a matter of language: They describe what it’s like to find yourself suddenly unable to speak with people you’ve known your whole life. They acknowledge how easily a national crisis can become a personal one.

CONTEXT_ASSERTION: my commentary here is about the whole reply context. This specific message is not what i'm addressing but the more banal messages claiming the hard drive shortage is completely fabricated. People claiming the supply is fine and only the price is being increased. The actual message I'm targeted is in response to the Reddit hive minded thinking that does not engage nonfiction.

DEFLECTION_FROM_BILLIONAIRES_AND_PUTINISM the Reddit comment section is full of low-effort commenting that deflects away form what billionaires are doing to the common man. Reddit tech cultists, cults of billionaire providers, love fiction but do not assert nonfiction and reality in the face of billionaires.

* April 9, 1944 USA Vice-President Henry Wallace: “The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity… They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.”

It is fiction content. That's what Reddit audiences desire and crave. Fiction to taste and measure and grade. Instead of doing an Internet WWW uprising to remove Donald Trump from the USA and do cult deprogramming with nonfiction books to rescue MAGA... free time and spare time is instead consuming fiction media. Nonfiction real-world reality concerns are abandoned. Because the technology of cameras and high-speed video delivery to smartphones is what matters to the population, images.

People need to admit REAL_PEOPLE_ADMIT that lavish talented performers are used to brainwash the population into out-group hate patterns. Levant science fiction stories that clergy has found so profitable and powerful. Hollywood films find profit in selling hate against genders, hate of women, exploitation of real-world relationships for profit and power concentration. Comparative mythology education is not optional.

CONTEXT_BEWILDERMENT what area of human life do these things NOT MATTER? "require correct interpretation. Context matters a lot"... this is a general society-wide information systems problem. We do not teach every person, and we outright have billionaires spending as much money and employing / contracting the most talented artists manipulating everyday people. Nation states have manipulated minds.

* May 7, 2017  https://www.TheGuardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an **authority in psyops and propaganda**, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, **it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.**” Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this **powerful new way**,” David tells me.

Media cultists are always claiming the other people "can not read", when they can. People can write and create comments on social media, demonstrating they have the language skills. What they lack is comprehension and understanding. "Reading between the lines" and metaphor understanding are not the same as "literacy" and "reading". In the era of Donald Trump as a role model, so many claim that Trump can not read... when in fact, I have seen time and time again that Trump has an eye for media ecology in a way Marshall McLuhan teaches that the hate-watching fandom of Trump does not comprehend or understand. Clearly people are attracted to the unique style and unusual ways of Trump, but people can not recognize it as a mass man (Marshall McLuhan terminology) social cult behavior.

* “Alfred North Whitehead summed it up best when he remarked that the greatest invention of the nineteenth century was the idea of invention itself. We had learned how to invent things, and the question of why we invent things receded in importance. The idea that if something could be done it should be done was born in the nineteenth century. And along with it, there developed a profound belief in all the principles through which invention succeeds: objectivity, efficiency, expertise, standardization, measurement, and progress. It also came to be believed that the engine of technological progress worked most efficiently when people are conceived of not as children of God or even as citizens but as consumers—that is to say, as markets.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. year 1992

* “the world we live in is very nearly incomprehensible to most of us. There is almost no fact, whether actual or imagined, that will surprise us for very long, since we have no comprehensive and consistent picture of the world that would make the fact appear as an unacceptable contradiction. We believe because there is no reason not to believe.” ― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. year 1992.

CONCERNS_OF_FINNEGANS entire reply thread about language. Unicode Dreams. My concern of why computer industry didn't develop a variable-name file-name special-use characters for dash / underscore and space so that it could be rendered different in consoles and code editors and still maintain some sanity with command-line argument and parameter spaces. No special keyboard difference would be required, as it could have been built into filename prompts and context-intelligent editors could realize when a variable name is being used. Such as: "IF A_B_C = 10 GOTO LABEL_NAME" - where this underscore is unique. And, also the issue of special quotation marks for putting words into other people's mouths - non-literal quotes of what a person might say or in the style of a person.

COMPREHENDING_UNDERSTANDING How can anyone on Reddit be surprised and not understand the impact Fox News HDTV has had on USA (and the world by extension). NOT_GOOD_ENOUGH Jen Senko hasn't been good enough for Reddit users to repeat and make a household name. Neil Postman wrote a book about the Fox News crisis in year 1985 which is 11 years before Fox News spun up in 1996. We have the same problem with the classic religion cults, people can not imagine that religions are **not supernatural** - which means potentially ANYONE can capture others with patterns of books and clergy and buildings. It is LITERALLY a storybook with a cult fandom who hates people who where raised by parents on DIFFERENT storybooks. We have, as a planet, no no way "Woken Up" to this crisis.

Published in year 1988, Power of Myth. Filmed by George Lucas for Star Wars fandom:

BILL MOYERS: I cherish that image: my hometown love, the feeling you get for that place, no matter how long you’ve been away or even if you never return. That was where you first discovered people. But why do you say **you love people for their imperfections**?

CAMPBELL: Aren’t children lovable because they’re falling down all the time and have little bodies with the heads too big? Didn’t Walt Disney know all about this when he did the seven dwarfs? And these funny little dogs that people have — they’re lovable because they’re so imperfect.

MOYERS: Perfection would be a bore, wouldn’t it?

CAMPBELL: It would have to be. It would be inhuman. **The umbilical point, the humanity, the thing that makes you human and not supernatural and immortal** — that’s what’s lovable. That is why some people have a very hard time loving God, because there’s no imperfection there. You can be in awe, but that would not be real love. It’s Christ on the cross that becomes lovable.

MOYERS: What do you mean?

CAMPBELL: Suffering. Suffering is imperfection, is it not?

MOYERS: The story of human suffering, striving, living —

CAMPBELL: — and youth coming to knowledge of itself, what it has to go through.
