Satire-washing all things MAGA and Trumpism. Sarcasm-washing, sane-washing and normalization via jokes and comedy tone. Anything but be serious and turn to nonfiction books on cult deprogramming. For over 10 and a half years... Reddit society engages all things related to Trump as a form of entertainment and amusement to comment upon. Sickening / sick society that prizes high-speed commenting an memes over nonfiction teaching. Elon Musk Twitter platform has been a huge source of normalizing Trump for content addicts.

Twitter-length message, Tweet-think mind patterns. Behaving as if it is accidental that Elon Musk is waging a war against truth and fact. Low-effort mocking comments are what addicts crave, over and over, hour after hour, avoiding serious books and authors. 

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

Peter Pomerantsev books on paper since year 2014, NOBODY on Reddit quoting nonfiction books!!!

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qd7g7l/maga_misinformation_level/nznvld2/

About as real as many Reddit low-effort comments. Where almost all Reddit accounts hide real names, real identity. But Elon Musk screen shot - rich people use their real names. But insincere Internet Research Agency has infiltrated Reddit commenting since year 2013. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 No concern for nonfiction books, just short little jokes that treat all MAGA as entertainment stimulation.

People eat it up on Reddit. ANYTHING but quote Dr. Bandy x Lee since year 2017 when her book on Trump was published. Anything to avoid nonfiction education on the cult behaviors around Trump.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdl8j/

Trump behaves like Internet users behave. People just don't get it. People who prize mocking aren't just a few, they don't stand up against it. People who prize hate are all over the world. Hate is not a USA only thing. And Bible / Jesus is supposed to be a role model for compassion education. I lived in the Middle East, they are no role model of good behavior! Parents have made Putin and Trump role models of leaders for their Children since year 2013. November 8, 2013 Trump was in Moscow, Russia showing sex beauty for attention.

People avoid Malala's words, people avoid Martin Luther King Jr's words. Swat Valley Pakistan experiences of a girl since January 3, 2009 apply just as well to anywhere in the entire world! The values we put into our mind, the way we teach our brain, is terrible. People do not stand up for education about hate as a human mind issue all across the planet. They revel in their hate leaders. People don't just support Putin and trump for a day or two, it goes on and on and on year after year. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpcs6e/

The way men treat men when in front of a camera or a Internet device, is terrible. In USA, the way systems like medical are used to dehumanize others. The pride people have in their home ownership competition to wall out the rest of the world.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpcx2b/

MLK Jr gets ignored by all generation on the Internet. I keep looking for people quoting the February 28,1954 teaching and people to say they have seen enough hate in the world. But people instead keep promoting *hate harder* and cheering on killing (Luigi) as a solution to avoiding the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpbyir/

I get banned on Reddit for standing up. What people want is a secret police to remove others, and reporting systems, and it all gets abused. Because nobody wants to make Dr. Bandy X Lee famous constant repeated topic (more than Epstein) and quote Bandy X Lee's books since year 2017. Nonfiction books and goodness leaders who are teaching have no attraction. Instead, people want comedians like Stephen Colbert to fix Trump problems. But entertainment-washing Trump is exactly hi source of power.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdp89/

"Crazy". But people won't turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee on social media and just comment on it day after day instead of organizing serious learning for adults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdi93/

"simple", "cult". How come social media, Reddit community, doesn't quote nonfiction books on cults? Just says the magical thinking word "cult" without linking a book, author name, etc? Anti-intellectual insulting and mocking. Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee name not repeated MORE THAN EPSTEIN? Why sin't cult deprogramming a constant discussion until the Fox News audience is resolved and people abandon news sources like Fox News?

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpe215/

Why does she have so few followers on Bluesky? There is no sense of time on Reddit commenting, it is like a casino with noises and no clocks - people can't grasp how long ago year 2017 was with Trump in power.

* “In Donald Trump, we have a frightening Venn diagram consisting of three circles: the first is extreme present hedonism; the second, narcissism; and the third, **bullying behavior.** These three circles overlap in the middle to create an impulsive, immature, incompetent person who, when in the position of ultimate power, easily slides into the role of tyrant, complete with family members sitting at his proverbial “ruling table.” Like a fledgling dictator, he plants psychological seeds of treachery in **sections of our population that reinforce already negative attitudes**.” ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

Why isn't social media famous now for having months-long anti-gaming campaigns? Sports games, video games? Because media addiction to treating the USA like sports mentality is the very problem.

This is an established pattern, it goes far beyond { satire, sarcasm } "LOVE", this is a media addict revealing their inner most motivation and desire... and is participation in a Trump controlled **Total Mockery** nation. The entire population is an audience to Trump's antics and hate campaign. 

* “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, **when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a **people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation** finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

Reddit users are playing a screen game of mocking the Daddy figure in the media cloud computing TCP/IP sky.

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”
― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.

Gun-worship society, weapon systems leaders of the world. A nation of 0.34 billion people that out weapons a planet of over 8 billion people. Technology addition, tech might. Strength via weapons.

Bullies dominate social media. People prize bullying / cyber-bullying as a "winning" method. Disappeared people all the time on social systems. Block, book burning, anti-learning praise of gun worship and death by violence. Mocking people who stand up for intellectual progress.

Malala in Swat Valley Taliban since January 3, 2009 was a test for humanity. The Internet opened up to the most remote and backwards places in the world. A girl got shot on her school bus after standing up to aggressive men. And people do not quote her book, assert her name, etc. Instead people chat all year 2025 the name "Epstein" - for a "List". Anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-girls. Private jet white man "Epstein" name repeated over and over while Malala's excellent writings and points rot on the bookshelf.

Note the young age of the Reddit account. The entire world is entertaining Trump USA because so much entertainment has come out of the USA in their lifetime. Hollywood films, television shows like The Simpsons, music, comics, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple iPhone, iPad, XBox, Valve Steam, etc.

* "According to Baudrillard’s reading of the war – **America as for Baudrillard the leading society culturally in the world, the one that leads the cultural trajectory of the world through television, movies and so on** – the war that we fought in the gulf was not directed against the enemy. I mean, as it turned out, the enemy was left not much different than we found them. It was not directed against any enemy at all. The enemy disappeared in the show business. The war was directed against reality. The war was to show us that even war isn’t real." - Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Prank-washing, joke-washing, casting as "just messing with", meme-washing. That's what has wrecked the entire USA. The attitude that as long as it is entertainment fiction, anything is possible. Nothing is true. As long as people prize pranks and jokes and insults above goodness itself.

https://old.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1qdswr9/wtf/nzsjz6b/

Joke-washing works on Reddit audiences every time. The front page of /r/All is a total mockery of joking about Trump. The biggest source of entertainment the USA has ever had! President Tony Clifton antics have turned everyone into joke audience.

Reddit comments describing how people believe and trust Trump. But there is *zero benefit* to trusting Trump. Trump is self-harm on a world-wide scale. Trump trusts Putin, and people trust Trump. Social media has been manipulated mentally to not be serious about Russian information warfare. The symptoms, the outcomes, the techniques, the timelines. Surkov won.

There have been no winners. Even Donald Trump, it can't possibly be enjoyable to work as hard as he does, running all around. Only if you are addicted to cameras, addicted to being "on stage" and in front of an audience - influencer / stardom addiction. But that's the problem, Reddit media addicts can't see their role model of a 79 year old media addict to Fox News HDTV...

Out-comedy SNL Weekend Update. A President **Tony Clifton** technique of out-late night Stephen Colbert joking. Sounds like everyone is always joking. Sounds like humor, sounds like memes, sounds like LOL sounds like funny-washing all the time, all day, all night, every day since June 16, 2015.

* “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

* "Expert Analysis: The film features interviews with historians and legal experts—such as Ruth Ben-Ghiat, an expert on strongmen and fascism, and Timothy Snyder, author of On Tyranny—who analyze Trump's rhetoric. They explain that autocrats often use humor to float extreme ideas, allowing them to claim they were "just kidding" if the backlash is too strong, while still moving the goalposts of acceptable political discourse." - Google Search 2026-01-15 afternoon USA - about "In Michael Moore’s 2018 documentary Fahrenheit 11/9, he interviews experts to discuss the concept of "trial balloons" regarding Donald Trump’s comments on serving a third term or staying in power indefinitely."

A few people notice. Alas, no off-Reddit links to describe in more detail. Just a Twitter-length comment about the situation. I've created this entire GitHub.. asserting Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan and timelines of Operation Matthew 4:19 social media fuck-over.

Tiny-short messages on Reddit. Do nothing, stay asleep, use spare time and free time to sleep away. Don't resist. Could be citing Dr Bandy X Lee's nonfiction books since October 3, 2017... but tiny-short reactions to Trump symbolism shuffle games.

Reddit is the antics fandom. People follow the hate signal leadership. Trump provides hate lessons and the Reddit audience embraces it. Addicts to Trump content, stimulated by the White House and Kremlin, don't ask others to join together in intellectual resistance to the information warfare / population manipulation.

Reddit account less than 2 weeks ago. Programming the Reddit consumers that this is funny, amusing, entertaining. Without Trump at the center of all media systems content, the world would be boring and unpalatable for meme addicts. Trump provides the bullshit and fiction that audiences have come to love and desire for mockery.
