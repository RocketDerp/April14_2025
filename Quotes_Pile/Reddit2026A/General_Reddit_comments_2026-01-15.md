Satire-washing all things MAGA and Trumpism. Sarcasm-washing, sane-washing and normalization via jokes and comedy tone. Anything but be serious and turn to nonfiction books on cult deprogramming. For over 10 and a half years... Reddit society engages all things related to Trump as a form of entertainment and amusement to comment upon. Sickening / sick society that prizes high-speed commenting an memes over nonfiction teaching. Elon Musk Twitter platform has been a huge source of normalizing Trump for content addicts.

Twitter-length message, Tweet-think mind patterns. Behaving as if it is accidental that Elon Musk is waging a war against truth and fact. Low-effort mocking comments are what addicts crave, over and over, hour after hour, avoiding serious books and authors. 

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

Peter Pomerantsev books on paper since year 2014, NOBODY on Reddit quoting nonfiction books!!!

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qd7g7l/maga_misinformation_level/nznvld2/

About as real as many Reddit low-effort comments. Where almost all Reddit accounts hide real names, real identity. But Elon Musk screen shot - rich people use their real names. But insincere Internet Research Agency has infiltrated Reddit commenting since year 2013. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 No concern for nonfiction books, just short little jokes that treat all MAGA as entertainment stimulation.

People eat it up on Reddit. ANYTHING but quote Dr. Bandy x Lee since year 2017 when her book on Trump was published. Anything to avoid nonfiction education on the cult behaviors around Trump.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdl8j/

Trump behaves like Internet users behave. People just don't get it. People who prize mocking aren't just a few, they don't stand up against it. People who prize hate are all over the world. Hate is not a USA only thing. And Bible / Jesus is supposed to be a role model for compassion education. I lived in the Middle East, they are no role model of good behavior! Parents have made Putin and Trump role models of leaders for their Children since year 2013. November 8, 2013 Trump was in Moscow, Russia showing sex beauty for attention.

People avoid Malala's words, people avoid Martin Luther King Jr's words. Swat Valley Pakistan experiences of a girl since January 3, 2009 apply just as well to anywhere in the entire world! The values we put into our mind, the way we teach our brain, is terrible. People do not stand up for education about hate as a human mind issue all across the planet. They revel in their hate leaders. People don't just support Putin and trump for a day or two, it goes on and on and on year after year. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpcs6e/

The way men treat men when in front of a camera or a Internet device, is terrible. In USA, the way systems like medical are used to dehumanize others. The pride people have in their home ownership competition to wall out the rest of the world.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpcx2b/

MLK Jr gets ignored by all generation on the Internet. I keep looking for people quoting the February 28,1954 teaching and people to say they have seen enough hate in the world. But people instead keep promoting *hate harder* and cheering on killing (Luigi) as a solution to avoiding the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpbyir/

I get banned on Reddit for standing up. What people want is a secret police to remove others, and reporting systems, and it all gets abused. Because nobody wants to make Dr. Bandy X Lee famous constant repeated topic (more than Epstein) and quote Bandy X Lee's books since year 2017. Nonfiction books and goodness leaders who are teaching have no attraction. Instead, people want comedians like Stephen Colbert to fix Trump problems. But entertainment-washing Trump is exactly hi source of power.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdp89/

"Crazy". But people won't turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee on social media and just comment on it day after day instead of organizing serious learning for adults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdi93/

"simple", "cult". How come social media, Reddit community, doesn't quote nonfiction books on cults? Just says the magical thinking word "cult" without linking a book, author name, etc? Anti-intellectual insulting and mocking. Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee name not repeated MORE THAN EPSTEIN? Why sin't cult deprogramming a constant discussion until the Fox News audience is resolved and people abandon news sources like Fox News?

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpe215/

Why does she have so few followers on Bluesky? There is no sense of time on Reddit commenting, it is like a casino with noises and no clocks - people can't grasp how long ago year 2017 was with Trump in power.

* “In Donald Trump, we have a frightening Venn diagram consisting of three circles: the first is extreme present hedonism; the second, narcissism; and the third, **bullying behavior.** These three circles overlap in the middle to create an impulsive, immature, incompetent person who, when in the position of ultimate power, easily slides into the role of tyrant, complete with family members sitting at his proverbial “ruling table.” Like a fledgling dictator, he plants psychological seeds of treachery in **sections of our population that reinforce already negative attitudes**.” ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

Why isn't social media famous now for having months-long anti-gaming campaigns? Sports games, video games? Because media addiction to treating the USA like sports mentality is the very problem.

This is an established pattern, it goes far beyond { satire, sarcasm } "LOVE", this is a media addict revealing their inner most motivation and desire... and is participation in a Trump controlled **Total Mockery** nation. The entire population is an audience to Trump's antics and hate campaign. 

* “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, **when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a **people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation** finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

Reddit users are playing a screen game of mocking the Daddy figure in the media cloud computing TCP/IP sky.

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

Malala in Swat Valley Taliban since January 3, 2009 was a test for humanity. The Internet opened up to the most remote and backwards places in the world. A girl got shot on her school bus after standing up to aggressive men. And people do not quote her book, assert her name, etc. Instead people chat all year 2025 the name "Epstein" - for a "List". Anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-girls. Private jet white man "Epstein" name repeated over and over while Malala's excellent writings and points rot on the bookshelf.

* "According to Baudrillard’s reading of the war – **America as for Baudrillard the leading society culturally in the world, the one that leads the cultural trajectory of the world through television, movies and so on** – the war that we fought in the gulf was not directed against the enemy. I mean, as it turned out, the enemy was left not much different than we found them. It was not directed against any enemy at all. The enemy disappeared in the show business. The war was directed against reality. The war was to show us that even war isn’t real." - Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Prank-washing, joke-washing, casting as "just messing with", meme-washing. That's what has wrecked the entire USA. The attitude that as long as it is entertainment fiction, anything is possible. Nothing is true. As long as people prize pranks and jokes and insults above goodness itself.

Joke-washing works on Reddit audiences every time. The front page of /r/All is a total mockery of joking about Trump. The biggest source of entertainment the USA has ever had! President Tony Clifton antics have turned everyone into joke audience.

Reddit comments describing how people believe and trust Trump. But there is *zero benefit* to trusting Trump. Trump is self-harm on a world-wide scale. Trump trusts Putin, and people trust Trump. Social media has been manipulated mentally to not be serious about Russian information warfare. The symptoms, the outcomes, the techniques, the timelines. Surkov won.

Comedy-washing, joke-washing, turning everything into comedy memes, is the very technique of Surkovian information warfare! The Kremlin defeated USA society since March 2013, there has been no self-awareness or recognition that people are mentally enslaved by Russian information warfare. The absence of being able to name players, timelines, is evidence!

The crisis is not just ONE PERSON, Donald Trump, taking bribes - but a mental mindset of self-harm to the USA and prizing of { hate, mockery, mass dehumanization } that is widespread. Everyone. Over 300 million people not just one 79 year old Putin buddy. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit itself! https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643

"Fake news" messaging, not describing it for what it is: a performer, a professional actor at the White House, playing a Tony Clifton performance / act.

This is an audience member declaring how terrible Tony Clifton looks on stage / podium. The age of the account is really *sus*, like an audience plant to heckle... to bamboozle other audience members. Very common to have audience plants in Tony Clifton shows.

* “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

We have been in that era since year 2013. And it was described in year 1993 (if not earlier):

* "When we are less important than a Nintendo we get confused. That’s when we start thinking that we are under siege. It’s when Billy says “Oh yes, you can kill mum and dad but leave the Nintendo”, then we are rightfully upset. The postmodern trajectory **leaves us in a situation where drawing the line between the real and the unreal is no longer merely philosophical but a practical day-to-day issue**. See, this is what I want to drive home. We are not off in some fairy land, this is a practical day-to-day issue of figuring out what’s a simulation and what’s not. Is **this guy really an insurance salesman or is he here to rob me**? You know, I mean… this is no longer Cartesian doubt that one has to conjure up in a meditation. **This is a wide radical doubt about the very ground beneath our feet and the nature of whether it’s real** or not." - Duke University, Texan Rick Roderick. https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

And billionaires have focused on media systems. When the richest person in the world purchased Twitter, people mocked about the financial cost and loss. The mindshare, the ability to program minds in the population, was far greater. Reddit front page has Twitter content very hour. Generative Artificial Intelligence systems are billionaires way to do 24 hours a day what previous labor could not do, addicted audiences to their services even more. We The People are driven by ENTERTAINMENT, FICTION STORYTELLING, above all else. The Fox News HDTV audience addiction to ENTERTAINMENT mocking has solidified. Fiction storytelling by Rupert Murdoch, Elon Musk Twitter, Truth Social Trump, etc.

Surkov students have done their job! 

* Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.Politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

Reddit audiences line up for every { breaking news, photograph of Trump, quote from Trump } to mock away at the Tony Clifton performance. Reddit meme consumers can't articulate that Trump is an actor doing acting. Performance content for meme audiences of Reddit and Blueksy. Pinning the Trump fandom into reacting to everything Trump does. Surkov won.

Finnegans Wake Joyce and Marshall McLuhan self-awareness has been shit out of the mass man mindsets. Surkov won since March 2013.

This chaotic GitHub I am writing on... is hope it will not take multiple decades to learn from this massive mistake: not teaching media ecology of Marshall McLuhan to audiences once he died NYE 1980.

Nothing is keeping Bluesky and Reddit end-users from asserting Dr. Bandy X. Lee's name and October 3, 2017 book quotes more often than "Epstein" gets repeated. Social media users are not standing up. There is no famous social media uprising against the bullshit of Fox News HDTV. People will not follow a GenX woman, Dr. Bandy X Lee. Just like in 2024 social media addicts wouldn't follow a GenX woman: Kamala Harris. But Epstein, a dead man, gets repeated over and over for a "list" (which is not justice, but a paper chase of information only within a mentally corrupted leadership system).
