Satire-washing all things MAGA and Trumpism. Sarcasm-washing, sane-washing and normalization via jokes and comedy tone. Anything but be serious and turn to nonfiction books on cult deprogramming. For over 10 and a half years... Reddit society engages all things related to Trump as a form of entertainment and amusement to comment upon. Sickening / sick society that prizes high-speed commenting an memes over nonfiction teaching. Elon Musk Twitter platform has been a huge source of normalizing Trump for content addicts.

Twitter-length message, Tweet-think mind patterns. Behaving as if it is accidental that Elon Musk is waging a war against truth and fact. Low-effort mocking comments are what addicts crave, over and over, hour after hour, avoiding serious books and authors. 

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark about "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. [Eating the onions](../Reddit2025A/Surkovian_Onion_Eating.md) that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

Peter Pomerantsev books on paper since year 2014, NOBODY on Reddit quoting nonfiction books!!!

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qd7g7l/maga_misinformation_level/nznvld2/

About as real as many Reddit low-effort comments. Where almost all Reddit accounts hide real names, real identity. But Elon Musk screen shot - rich people use their real names. But insincere Internet Research Agency has infiltrated Reddit commenting since year 2013. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 No concern for nonfiction books, just short little jokes that treat all MAGA as entertainment stimulation.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdl8j/

Trump behaves like Internet users behave. People just don't get it. People who prize mocking aren't just a few, they don't stand up against it. People who prize hate are all over the world. Hate is not a USA only thing. And Bible / Jesus is supposed to be a role model for compassion education. I lived in the Middle East, they are no role model of good behavior! Parents have made Putin and Trump role models of leaders for their Children since year 2013. November 8, 2013 Trump was in Moscow, Russia showing sex beauty for attention.

People avoid Malala's words, people avoid Martin Luther King Jr's words. Swat Valley Pakistan experiences of a girl since January 3, 2009 apply just as well to anywhere in the entire world! The values we put into our mind, the way we teach our brain, is terrible. People do not stand up for education about hate as a human mind issue all across the planet. They revel in their hate leaders. People don't just support Putin and trump for a day or two, it goes on and on and on year after year. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpcs6e/

The way men treat men when in front of a camera or a Internet device, is terrible. In USA, the way systems like medical are used to dehumanize others. The pride people have in their home ownership competition to wall out the rest of the world.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpcx2b/

MLK Jr gets ignored by all generation on the Internet. I keep looking for people quoting the February 28,1954 teaching and people to say they have seen enough hate in the world. But people instead keep promoting *hate harder* and cheering on killing (Luigi) as a solution to avoiding the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpbyir/

I get banned on Reddit for standing up. What people want is a secret police to remove others, and reporting systems, and it all gets abused. Because nobody wants to make Dr. Bandy X Lee famous constant repeated topic (more than Epstein) and quote Bandy X Lee's books since year 2017. Nonfiction books and goodness leaders who are teaching have no attraction. Instead, people want comedians like Stephen Colbert to fix Trump problems. But entertainment-washing Trump is exactly hi source of power.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdp89/

"Crazy". But people won't turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee on social media and just comment on it day after day instead of organizing serious learning for adults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdi93/

"simple", "cult". How come social media, Reddit community, doesn't quote nonfiction books on cults? Just says the magical thinking word "cult" without linking a book, author name, etc? Anti-intellectual insulting and mocking. Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee name not repeated MORE THAN EPSTEIN? Why sin't cult deprogramming a constant discussion until the Fox News audience is resolved and people abandon news sources like Fox News?

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpe215/

Why does she have so few followers on Bluesky? There is no sense of time on Reddit commenting, it is like a casino with noises and no clocks - people can't grasp how long ago year 2017 was with Trump in power.

* “In Donald Trump, we have a frightening Venn diagram consisting of three circles: the first is extreme present hedonism; the second, narcissism; and the third, **bullying behavior.** These three circles overlap in the middle to create an impulsive, immature, incompetent person who, when in the position of ultimate power, easily slides into the role of tyrant, complete with family members sitting at his proverbial “ruling table.” Like a fledgling dictator, he plants psychological seeds of treachery in **sections of our population that reinforce already negative attitudes**.” ― Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: [27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

Why isn't social media famous now for having months-long anti-gaming campaigns? Sports games, video games? Because media addiction to treating the USA like sports mentality is the very problem.

* “When a population becomes distracted by trivia, **when cultural life is redefined as a perpetual round of entertainments**, when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby-talk, when, in short, a **people become an audience, and their public business a vaudeville act, then a nation** finds itself at risk; culture-death is a clear possibility.” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business

Reddit users are playing a screen game of mocking the Daddy figure in the media cloud computing TCP/IP sky.

* “Chaos and disruption, I later learned, are central tenets of Bannon's animating ideology. Before catalyzing America's dharmic rebalancing, his movement would first need to instill chaos through society so that a new order could emerge. He was an avid reader of a computer scientist and armchair philosopher who goes by the name Mencius Moldbug, a hero of the alt-right who writes long-winded essays attacking democracy and virtually everything about how modern societies are ordered. Moldbug’s views on truth influenced Bannon, and what Cambridge Analytica would become. Moldbug has written that “nonsense is a more effective organizing tool than the truth,” and Bannon embraced this. “Anyone can believe in the truth,” Moldbug writes, “to believe in nonsense is an unforgettable demonstration of loyalty. It serves as a political uniform. And if you have a uniform, you have an army.”

Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.”

Malala in Swat Valley Taliban since January 3, 2009 was a test for humanity. The Internet opened up to the most remote and backwards places in the world. A girl got shot on her school bus after standing up to aggressive men. And people do not quote her book, assert her name, etc. Instead people chat all year 2025 the name "Epstein" - for a "List". Anti-education, anti-teaching, anti-girls. Private jet white man "Epstein" name repeated over and over while Malala's excellent writings and points rot on the bookshelf.

* "According to Baudrillard’s reading of the war – **America as for Baudrillard the leading society culturally in the world, the one that leads the cultural trajectory of the world through television, movies and so on** – the war that we fought in the gulf was not directed against the enemy. I mean, as it turned out, the enemy was left not much different than we found them. It was not directed against any enemy at all. The enemy disappeared in the show business. The war was directed against reality. The war was to show us that even war isn’t real." - Rick Roderick, Duke University https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

Prank-washing, joke-washing, casting as "just messing with", meme-washing. That's what has wrecked the entire USA. The attitude that as long as it is entertainment fiction, anything is possible. Nothing is true. As long as people prize pranks and jokes and insults above goodness itself.

Joke-washing works on Reddit audiences every time. The front page of /r/All is a total mockery of joking about Trump. The biggest source of entertainment the USA has ever had! President Tony Clifton antics have turned everyone into joke audience.

Reddit comments describing how people believe and trust Trump. But there is *zero benefit* to trusting Trump. Trump is self-harm on a world-wide scale. Trump trusts Putin, and people trust Trump. Social media has been manipulated mentally to not be serious about Russian information warfare. The symptoms, the outcomes, the techniques, the timelines. Surkov won.

Comedy-washing, joke-washing, turning everything into comedy memes, is the very technique of Surkovian information warfare! The Kremlin defeated USA society since March 2013, there has been no self-awareness or recognition that people are mentally enslaved by Russian information warfare. The absence of being able to name players, timelines, is evidence!

The crisis is not just ONE PERSON, Donald Trump, taking bribes - but a mental mindset of self-harm to the USA and prizing of { hate, mockery, mass dehumanization } that is widespread. Everyone. Over 300 million people not just one 79 year old Putin buddy. The Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit itself! https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643

"Fake news" messaging, not describing it for what it is: a performer, a professional actor at the White House, playing a Tony Clifton performance / act.

This is an audience member declaring how terrible Tony Clifton looks on stage / podium. The age of the account is really *sus*, like an audience plant to heckle... to bamboozle other audience members. Very common to have audience plants in Tony Clifton shows.

* “Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

We have been in that era since year 2013. And it was described in year 1993 (if not earlier):

* "When we are less important than a Nintendo we get confused. That’s when we start thinking that we are under siege. It’s when Billy says “Oh yes, you can kill mum and dad but leave the Nintendo”, then we are rightfully upset. The postmodern trajectory **leaves us in a situation where drawing the line between the real and the unreal is no longer merely philosophical but a practical day-to-day issue**. See, this is what I want to drive home. We are not off in some fairy land, this is a practical day-to-day issue of figuring out what’s a simulation and what’s not. Is **this guy really an insurance salesman or is he here to rob me**? You know, I mean… this is no longer Cartesian doubt that one has to conjure up in a meditation. **This is a wide radical doubt about the very ground beneath our feet and the nature of whether it’s real** or not." - Duke University, Texan Rick Roderick. https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? **Politics has got to feel like a movie!**”

Nothing is keeping Bluesky and Reddit end-users from asserting Dr. Bandy X. Lee's name and October 3, 2017 book quotes more often than "Epstein" gets repeated. Social media users are not standing up. There is no famous social media uprising against the bullshit of Fox News HDTV. People will not follow a GenX woman, Dr. Bandy X Lee. Just like in 2024 social media addicts wouldn't follow a GenX woman: Kamala Harris. But Epstein, a dead man, gets repeated over and over for a "list" (which is not justice, but a paper chase of information only within a mentally corrupted leadership system).

Not going to get there with tiny-short commenting. For one, why isn't Dr. Bandy X Lee and her October 3, 2017 book not being commented more than "Epstein"? Dr Lee's book directly addresses the badness and hate that Trump inspires, all of MAGA hundreds of millions of people. Without addressing the mental health issues of MAGA fandom, how can girls be protected from Epstein revelations? If anything, MAGA takes inspiration and has made Epstein a role model (like Vince Gilligan says about bad guys at his February 15, 2025 writers guild speech).

I created this GitHub out out of hope that at least somebody might want to learn the true true lesson that Marshall McLuhan actually understood in the 1960's and education and self-awareness of James Joyce could have prevented people from sleeping through the "rear-view mirror" of "Make american GREAT AGAIN" (rear).

* “Joyce is, in the *Wake*, making his own Altamira cave drawings of the entire history of the human mind, in terms of its basic gestures and postures during all the phases of human culture and technology. As his title indicates, he saw that the wake of **human progress can disappear again into the night of sacral or auditory man**. The Finn cycle of **tribal institutions can return** in the electric age, but if again, then let’s make it a wake or awake or both. Joyce could see no advantage in our remaining locked up in each cultural cycle as in a trance or dream. He discovered the means of living simultaneously in all cultural modes while quite conscious.” — the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel. It was published in March 1967. https://www.themediumisthemassage.com/the-book/

Diversity, democracy, diverse Pale Blue Dot is more mental labor but it's good woke. Year 1923 Finn's Hotel from James Joyce is a key leap forward in world wide comprehension. Education matters. Elon Musk purchasing Twitter was the clue that media Tweeting, media social media, is exactly what McLuhan was saying up to his death NYE 1980... Please Stop mocking Tweeting and Truth Social and take it seriously. Trump is a Twitter addict an Fox News NDTV addiction runs Trump mindsets.

The "strong male leader" of Surkov monomyth manipulation of the executive function of minds... prizes abusing girls and women. Pussy Riot band from Russia has been spelling this out for a decade plus now.

* "Pussy Riot came into the world stage in 2012 following their "Punk Prayer" performance in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, which led to the arrest and imprisonment of several members. While the feminist punk protest group was founded in August 2011 and began performing guerrilla gigs in Moscow in late 2011, it was the international notoriety surrounding the February 2012 anti-Putin protest and subsequent trial that brought them global attention." - Google Search summary 2026-01-18 noonish USA

There has been no social media uprising. The nation that created BBS social media, created TCP/IP, created the Internet can no longer imaging organizing a sustained protest movement VIA the Internet. Trump's rise to power in year 2012 was social media! Reference: July 6, 2011 https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

ANSWER: No. Understanding and comprehension are the lowest they have been since the founding of the nation nearly 250 years ago. Anti-intellectual meme-lifestyle has taken over. People are entirely avoidant of nonfiction books on paper now. Only caring about the rapid commenting on high-speed meme systems.

https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1qgiwcm/younger_americans_have_grown_up_during_a_more/o0d85tz/

Yep. Liberal vs. Conservative has been mind-fucked by Rupert Murdoch to mean all kinds of different things to different people. It's brainrot. SPECIFIC LISTS of values. For example: wanting fiction leadership by Donald Trump vs. scientific nonfiction leadership. Donald Trump holds up a SCIENCE FICTION STORY, IMPORTED FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, "The Bible", and wants to lead with fiction stories. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Fiction is far more popular to meme society, social meme consumers.

What is happening here is a society that prizes a few people standing up while spectators spend free time and spare time on social sites / media platforms - consuming and commenting. What is absent is reprogramming our own minds away from media addiction. Dr. Bandy X Lee is what we need to be focused on for ult deprogramming of MAGA. The cult is a death cult and fighting it with physical weapons will only inspire more death cult generations. Humanity never DID GET on the high road, and now is the worst it needs to ever get... we need to value peace and education. Rescue MAGA mindsets. Prizing hate is bad for all mankind.

* "A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - December 31, 2014, BBC, Adam Curtis
* "But **the key thing was**, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps **any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting** that is unstoppable because it is undefinable." - BBC, Adam Curtis, New Years Eve 2014

In context of the posting Title on Reddit "Really Living In A Democracy"... refresher BEFORE Project 2025 got attention, this DID NOT get public attention from Reddit community, We The People...

* Russia media expert, Reality TV producer in Moscow (Pomerantsev): “The display, which was called **'Can Democracy Survive the Internet?'** was dedicated to a 'global election management' company called Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica claimed to have gathered 5,000 data points on every American voter online: what you liked and what you shared on social media; how and where you shopped; who your friends were... They claimed to be able to take this imprint of your online self, use it to understand your deepest drives and desires, and then draw on that analysis to change your voting behaviour. The boast seemed to be backed up by success: Cambridge Analytica had worked on the victorious American presidential campaign of Donald Trump; it had also run successful campaigns for US Senator Ted Cruz (twice); and others all across Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America.” ― Peter Pomerantsev, This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality, 2019

* https://www.TheGuardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy This is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, **it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.**”

Alas, everyone is consuming commenting at extremely high speeds on Reddit postings and not getting on the same page of 2017 and 2019 nonfiction learning. Commenting sections are where comprehension goes to drown away, drunken washing.

This is what social media could be doing all the time with free time and spare time. Explaining the REAL WORLD. Translating art to prose. Understanding real human people. Not chasing around fiction content of Reality TV MAGA, posting every photograph and quote of a fiction President Tony Clifton performance and chasing mythological ideas. And we could organize these explanations of art and human experiences into a Wiki Tribune... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiTribune

We could all get on *the same page* of a Wiki an try to have shared understanding of reality. Instead of drowning ourselves in fragmented tiny-short Tweet commenting. We could take pride in Humanity itself, Earth pride, instead of competing to bamboozle, trick, manipulate each other.

Yes, these conversations are interesting. But they are not nearly the priority right now in January 2026. This is more White House Trump fandom eating the messages coming out of the White House, reaction commenting of the cult of commenting on Reddit.

Instead of reacting, social media (Reddit) audiences need to stand up and assert goodness. Deeper, sustained, focused, repeating.

There is a very serious problem of people saying "never read a book". The Bible is incredibly difficult to read! It is complex poetry. To downplay the { comprehension, understanding, interpretations } of the { Torah, Bible, Quran, Book of Mormon } is a big mistake in my view. The issue is not reading it, it is the paradoxes that arise out of poetry and metaphors. People can read a book or watch a film and get entirely different concepts and ideas with that. This is a huge reason University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan made James Joyce's writings a cornerstone of this media ecology teachings!

Video gaming has always had A.I. game behaviors, machine player against the player. Most "cheat" by knowing where the player is in a maze, such as early video games like Pac-Man https://Old.Reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1m27o0/til_that_the_four_ghosts_in_pacman_are_programmed/
And I remember the magazines and arcade players learned pretty quickly where you could sit in the maze and pause the game because the A.I. logic was so primitive. But that was early 8-bit games (year 1980 hardware, Zilog Z80 CPU running at 3.072 MHz)

My point is that video game players are pro machine intelligence in general. Machines programmed to defeat humans in killing, etc. For the sake of entertainment.

A rare Reddit message comment that calls out the forest of lies, not just barking at the one tree on April 14, 2025. Fiction outsells nonfiction. Fox News HDTV fiction is far more popular and outsells nonfiction. Putin and Surkov figured this out more than 25 years ago and started exporting it via the Internet Research Agency to Reddit and other media systems since March 2013. Lies and deception are incredibly popular. Popularity itself is toxic since March 2013.

"Won't do a thing about it", so gullible on Reddit. It's all about feeding addiction. We have known since the 1960's from Marshall McLuhan but people are uneducated, never heard of Marshall McLuhan. But everyone in USA has Trump on their touching screen every 1.2 hours. People learning and studying Trump every 75 minutes or less.

BILLIONAIRES run Reddit, Twitter messages of the richest man in the whole fucking world are on Reddit /r/All every hour of day and night! THEY ARE DOING THINGS ABOUT IT, HIRING CHEAP OVERSEAS LABOR TO OUTSOURCE THEY BILLIONAIRES DO SINCE YEAR 1981!!! The gullibility and celebration of Ignorance on Reddit isn't accidental!

I am not ignorant on these media behavior subjects, I have insider knowledge and experience. I am a published author on social media systems! I traveled to Africa for the social media revolution I predicted... the Arab Spring 2010. I traveled to the Middle East to study social media of the Syria war outbreak! I've authored and sold and operated (SysOp) social media systems in high school in year 1985 and 1986! I was an educator of social media systems to Microsoft employees in Redmond Washington, a 2-week course instructor for staff of Microsoft... on social media systems!

* "First, we must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. It is impossible even to begin the act of loving one's enemies without prior acceptance of the necessity, over and over again, of forgiving those who inflict evil and injury upon us. It is also necessary to realize that the forgiving act must always be initiated by the person who has been wronged, the victim of some great hurt, the recipient of some tortuous injustice, the absorber of some terrible act of oppression. The wrongdoer may request forgiveness. He may come to himself, and, like the prodigal son, move up with some dusty road, his heart palpitating with the desire for forgiveness. But only the injured neighbor, the loving father back home can really pour out the warm waters of forgiveness." - Christmas. Montgomery, Alabama (25 December 1957)

Haha. Look at the date on this comment, and look at my GitHub project commits a couple days ago ;) I took a photo of this to my love interest at the airport in Paris to show here I was legit on my way from Africa and a real person ;) Here are the photos from December year 2010 as part of Arab Spring: https://GitHub.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/tree/main/Art/ScreenPlay/Arab_Spring

Reddit does not get it. even if the photo is fake (generative artificial intelligence), people still share photos like this. I am a real person who shared mine to my wife on my way to our wedding. Our first in-person meeting... just like the topic of this Reddit posting (long-distance lover over the Internet, which is how I met my wife, how we got married from Algeria to USA).

I deliberately did not wear expensive clothing, I dressed casual as I did not want to misrepresent myself. In my 20's when I was a consulting for Software Spectrum and working in Seattle (Bellevue) for $250/hour billable to clients (I didn't get that money, Software Spectrum did) in 1995... I dressed like that. But not in 2009 and 2010 when I was engaging the Arab Spring over the Internet. So you will see my December 2, 2010 photos I did not dress fancy. I dressed as a casual middle aged American who has worked at home since 1999. Not like a rich businessman. My wife knew I used to work for the richest people in the entire world and I was trying to make it very clear I did not have wealth... it was a job and I valued experience and insider access over investing and money. I value world peace, not wealth hoarding. So I dressed just as I would going out on a date in Austin, Texas in those photos. 

I even kept my beard scruffy as I normally had appeared in video calls all year 2010 from Austin. I did not want to use money and fashion to represent myself as anything but what I was. A computer nerd who had the privilege to work at home since late year 1999 and had traveled and lived overseas in South America ([Arica, Chile](https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica)) and in an RV home office all over USA.

As a billionaire computer industry insider... it is great to see people emphasize that the "free" consumer-facing rapid runtime AI systems are not the same as paid.

That's why people love Reddit cloud computing machines, they are so fast and deliver content on demand. A live performance with a troubled soul who sings about troubles is... hate-worthy and mock-worthy. Because humans are not machines. And it's scary that people prize the humans who "act the best" in films and such when real people do not behave like edited and practiced performers in troubling situations. Except when Russia mind-fucked the population to regard MAGA cult to be entertainment, they crowds act in predicable conditioned reposes to horrors.

The worst thing is how all the people with free time and spare time reaction-commenting to BREAKING HIGH-SPEED NEWS over and over and aren't standing up in a sustained thoughtful way to Putin and Trump wrecking the entire world systemically. People who won't turn to nonfiction and rescue USA with education:

* "Social media have changed the way Americans are exposed to news. Internet news sites (CNN, Huffington Post, etc.) and social media such as Facebook and Twitter **provide immediate access to news as well as to comments from other readers** with differing viewpoints. Many Americans impacted by Trump anxiety disorder have admitted to an **unhealthy obsession with checking news websites** much more often than they previously did, and the amount of news involving Trump and his new administration has been constant, chaotic, confusing, and often overwhelming. When struggling with anxiety, many individuals, in an attempt to maintain control, will falsely assume that the more they know, the more they can be prepared. However, this tends to give them a false sense of control and, paradoxically, may increase anxiety symptoms once they realize their grip on control is not solid." - Dr. Bandy X Lee, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.

She had friends, lived a fulfilling and full life. What's far more sad is the bamboozle that people on Reddit, millions and millions of people, live under by billionaires puppeting Truth Social and Twitter memes in front of their eyes. The lacking of self-awareness at the Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman level to be controlled and manipulated by Elon Musk Twitter and Donald Trump Truth Social constantly screenshot onto Reddit. That's truly sad. I appreciate and enjoy Catherine O'Hara's work and share it with others... art connects me to living people. What's really said is people not seeing what is going on to their non-famous neighbors, and humanity in total, at the hands of Elon Musk, Putin, and Donald Trump.

What's said is how the entire population of USA age 12 to age 130 isn't using social media to promote Dr. Bandy X Lee's nonfiction education for the general public about Trump's dangerous and dehumanizing leadership. And the spare time and free time people spend commenting about Trump instead of organizing to remove Trump and educate and rescue MAGA from media cults. Children are being raised with Trump as a role model, new cults are expanding every day. The emotions over one celebrity actor / acting star: Donald Trump. That rules a society that can not seem to recognize cult behavior towards Home Alone appearances and TV stars.

Deaths like this inspire me to focus on those still alive. It is far more sad to know that a child is being put in front of Fox News HDTV at age 9 right now and being indoctrinated into worship of celebrity culture by adult parents at age 30.
