Gleeful at the situations MAGA and Trump create. Thrilled at misunderstandings and conflicts. Anti-goodness.

Satire-washing all things MAGA and Trumpism. Sarcasm-washing, sane-washing and normalization via jokes and comedy tone. Anything but be serious and turn to nonfiction books on cult deprogramming. For over 10 and a half years... Reddit society engages all things related to Trump as a form of entertainment and amusement to comment upon. Sickening / sick society that prizes high-speed commenting an memes over nonfiction teaching. Elon Musk Twitter platform has been a huge source of normalizing Trump for content addicts.

Twitter-length message, Tweet-think mind patterns. Behaving as if it is accidental that Elon Musk is waging a war against truth and fact. Low-effort mocking comments are what addicts crave, over and over, hour after hour, avoiding serious books and authors. 

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

Peter Pomerantsev books on paper since year 2014, NOBODY on Reddit quoting nonfiction books!!!

About as real as many Reddit low-effort comments. Where almost all Reddit accounts hide real names, real identity. But Elon Musk screen shot - rich people use their real names. But insincere Internet Research Agency has infiltrated Reddit commenting since year 2013. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 No concern for nonfiction books, just short little jokes that treat all MAGA as entertainment stimulation.

People eat it up on Reddit. ANYTHING but quote Dr. Bandy x Lee since year 2017 when her book on Trump was published. Anything to avoid nonfiction education on the cult behaviors around Trump.
