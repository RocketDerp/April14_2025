Gleeful at the situations MAGA and Trump create. Thrilled at misunderstandings and conflicts. Anti-goodness.

https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1qd7g7l/maga_misinformation_level/nznryfd/

Satire-washing all things MAGA and Trumpism. Sarcasm-washing, sane-washing and normalization via jokes and comedy tone. Anything but be serious and turn to nonfiction books on cult deprogramming. For over 10 and a half years... Reddit society engages all things related to Trump as a form of entertainment and amusement to comment upon. Sickening / sick society that prizes high-speed commenting an memes over nonfiction teaching. Elon Musk Twitter platform has been a huge source of normalizing Trump for content addicts.

Twitter-length message, Tweet-think mind patterns. Behaving as if it is accidental that Elon Musk is waging a war against truth and fact. Low-effort mocking comments are what addicts crave, over and over, hour after hour, avoiding serious books and authors. 

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. Simple-think logic polarity minds. Snark bout "reality" on the audience commenting mind, but no recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit... September 9, 2014: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ - joking to "imagine" / dream up fiction of anti-reality, dreamland. Anything to avoid learning / grasping nonfiction Russian information warfare history and techniques.

Peter Pomerantsev books on paper since year 2014, NOBODY on Reddit quoting nonfiction books!!!

About as real as many Reddit low-effort comments. Where almost all Reddit accounts hide real names, real identity. But Elon Musk screen shot - rich people use their real names. But insincere Internet Research Agency has infiltrated Reddit commenting since year 2013. https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643 No concern for nonfiction books, just short little jokes that treat all MAGA as entertainment stimulation.

People eat it up on Reddit. ANYTHING but quote Dr. Bandy x Lee since year 2017 when her book on Trump was published. Anything to avoid nonfiction education on the cult behaviors around Trump.

Trump behaves like Internet users behave. People just don't get it. People who prize mocking aren't just a few, they don't stand up against it. People who prize hate are all over the world. Hate is not a USA only thing. And Bible / Jesus is supposed to be a role model for compassion education. I lived in the Middle East, they are no role model of good behavior! Parents have made Putin and Trump role models of leaders for their Children since year 2013. November 8, 2013 Trump was in Moscow, Russia showing sex beauty for attention.

People avoid Malala's words, people avoid Martin Luther King Jr's words. Swat Valley Pakistan experiences of a girl since January 3, 2009 apply just as well to anywhere in the entire world! The values we put into our mind, the way we teach our brain, is terrible. People do not stand up for education about hate as a human mind issue all across the planet. They revel in their hate leaders. People don't just support Putin and trump for a day or two, it goes on and on and on year after year.

The way men treat men when in front of a camera or a Internet device, is terrible. In USA, the way systems like medical are used to dehumanize others. The pride people have in their home ownership competition to wall out the rest of the world.

MLK Jr gets ignored by all generation on the Internet. I keep looking for people quoting the February 28,1954 teaching and people to say they have seen enough hate in the world. But people instead keep promoting *hate harder* and cheering on killing (Luigi) as a solution to avoiding the Second Bill of Rights from January 1944.

I get banned on Reddit for standing up. What people want is a secret police to remove others, and reporting systems, and it all gets abused. Because nobody wants to make Dr. Bandy X Lee famous constant repeated topic (more than Epstein) and quote Bandy X Lee's books since year 2017. Nonfiction books and goodness leaders who are teaching have no attraction. Instead, people want comedians like Stephen Colbert to fix Trump problems. But entertainment-washing Trump is exactly hi source of power.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdp89/

"Crazy". But people won't turn to Dr. Bandy X Lee on social media and just comment on it day after day instead of organizing serious learning for adults.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/1qdflr2/why_isnt_anyone_speaking_up/nzpdi93/

"simple", "cult". How come social media, Reddit community, doesn't quote nonfiction books on cults? Just says the magical thinking word "cult" without linking a book, author name, etc? Anti-intellectual insulting and mocking. Why is Dr. Bandy X Lee name not repeated MORE THAN EPSTEIN? Why sin't cult deprogramming a constant discussion until the Fox News audience is resolved and people abandon news sources like Fox News?
