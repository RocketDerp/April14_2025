"Hello, You should take a step back from pluribus a bit (i know it is very engaging) and explore other stuff for a bit. You can go watch and read about A song of ice and fire, play video games, go outside se nature (if you have possiblity) instead of obsedding with post after post on this subreddit. Internet points are not that important, you don't know any of these people, don't worry about it too much, relax and try new stuff."

1. "internet points"

A nation has elected liars. Deception. Bamboozle. My concern is not "internet points", this isn't a video game. This is teaching of the diest religion and the values of "love one another". Not bomb people in other nations, take away health care, and compete for "internet points" and dehumanize others

The way homosexuals are treated, such as Carol's "Camp Freedom Falls", the prizing of hate.

Banning people, dehumanizing people, with this "go outdoors" doesn't deal with 

1. people who don't believe in forgiveness

2. People who think "love they enemy" is optional, unimportant

3. Competition to dominate others and "win" Internet points instead of understand and comprehend one another.

Basically everything Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. says about forgiveness, hate, systems vs. individuals
