PUTIN_SURKOV_TRUMP_LONG_TERM_YEARS_PLAN The timeline is... Russia claims November 8, 2012 agreement with Trump: "Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.." then the IRA in Q2 2013. Then Donald Trump's private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013. Then December 20, 2013 publican in English language of the global movement https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ then February 20, 2014 the Ukraine war started.

Reddit users suffer from such extreme RECENCY_BIAS they are left feeling that this Russia-USA self-harm to the world is going very fast, but it is not as rapid as people think. The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki favoring of low-effort commenting, users of Reddit are all on different pages of ideas. Scattered, fragmented mindsets. The long-term shifts to anti-empathy pro-war anti-compassion pro-terrorism police state values and wrecking of NATO was in stages. Trump being removed from office and replaced by Joe Biden for 4 years slowed the progress down slightly.

The image "they are complicit". They are cult members. Every person on Reddit who says the world "complicit" and "cult" without bothering to quote, link, cite, name nonfiction books is "complicit". If you have the ability to create comments on Reddit, why are you not mentioning Peter Pomerantsev article from October 20, 2011? https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin which talks about media cult creation. Or the September 9, 2014 article by Peter Pomerantsev? https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ which is after the hot Ukraine war started February 20, 2014. If you are focused on protecting girls, why isn't what Putin is doing to abduct and indoctrinate children into private affairs not discussed? Epstein had an island, but Putin has an entire military capturing children and terrorizing children. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war Are you ignorant of the sex trade and systemic rape abuse of girls in Russia? 

* Russia society values... "Back in her home town, in Donetsk(?). Mass gang rapes over a series of days" https://youtu.be/5Au332OG-M4?t=645 "It's normal, it happens to all the girls, no biggie". This is what Donald Trump admires as a society role model / system of society.
