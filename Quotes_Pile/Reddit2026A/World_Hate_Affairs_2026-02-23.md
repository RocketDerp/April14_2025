PUTIN_SURKOV_TRUMP_LONG_TERM_YEARS_PLAN The timeline is... Russia claims November 8, 2012 agreement with Trump: "Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.." then the IRA in Q2 2013. Then Donald Trump's private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013. Then December 20, 2013 publican in English language of the global movement https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ then February 20, 2014 the Ukraine war started.

Reddit users suffer from such extreme RECENCY_BIAS they are left feeling that this Russia-USA self-harm to the world is going very fast, but it is not as rapid as people think. The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki favoring of low-effort commenting, users of Reddit are all on different pages of ideas. Scattered, fragmented mindsets. The long-term shifts to anti-empathy pro-war anti-compassion pro-terrorism police state values and wrecking of NATO was in stages. Trump being removed from office and replaced by Joe Biden for 4 years slowed the progress down slightly.

The image "they are complicit". They are cult members. Every person on Reddit who says the world "complicit" and "cult" without bothering to quote, link, cite, name nonfiction books is "complicit". If you have the ability to create comments on Reddit, why are you not mentioning Peter Pomerantsev article from October 20, 2011? https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin which talks about media cult creation. Or the September 9, 2014 article by Peter Pomerantsev? https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ which is after the hot Ukraine war started February 20, 2014. If you are focused on protecting girls, why isn't what Putin is doing to abduct and indoctrinate children into private affairs not discussed? Epstein had an island, but Putin has an entire military capturing children and terrorizing children. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war Are you ignorant of the sex trade and systemic rape abuse of girls in Russia? 

* Russia society values... "Back in her home town, in Donetsk(?). Mass gang rapes over a series of days" https://youtu.be/5Au332OG-M4?t=645 "It's normal, it happens to all the girls, no biggie". This is what Donald Trump admires as a society role model / system of society.

Why is Reddit community not organizing blackout protests? FAQ, Wiki organized information?? BRAIN_ROT_SOCIETY_47

REAL_WW3 One single click away. OBSERVE_SOCIAL_MEDIA_AVOIDING_NONFICTION but the anti-FAQ anti-Wiki anti-organization values of social media users in year 2026 is to comment and comment and comment instead of get everyone on the same important relevant pages of a topic. OBSERVE what is avoided: "The **underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war**, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - **December 31, 2014 BBC** - yes YEAR 2014 of the Ukraine war by Russia. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

Reddit end-users won't stop commenting lazy low-effort comments. Avoiding factual reality that Putin / Kremlin openly **said that their aim was not to WIN the war**. Reddit end user won't admit that avoiding non-fiction adult learning, avoiding FAQ creation, avoiding Wiki creation since year 2014 and **all getting on the same page of common comprehension and understanding** matters and that Reddit itself is part of the failures. Before year 2012, minds were not fragmented. The IRA and Surkov won since March 2013. OBSERVE_SOCIAL_MEDIA_AVOIDING_NONFICTION  "The **underlying aim, Surkov says, is not to win the war**, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception, in order to manage and control." - **December 31, 2014 BBC** - yes YEAR 2014 of the Ukraine war by Russia. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html

Reddit users eat up the Saint Petersburg Internet Research Agency manipulation and infiltration since March 2013. Reddit users can't even NAME information warfare of Reddit itself https://www.BBC.com/news/technology-43301643 , people on Reddit who can't name Surkov techniques, can't name Peter Pomerantsev as a source of media television warfare experience in Moscow. Reddit users LOVE these short shit-talk anti-Ukraine messages that do not discuss REDDIT ITSELF being part of the organized War Against Reality, War Against Nonfiction WAR_AGAINST_REALITY 

* From September 9, 2014 - 11 years 5 months and 2 weeks ago, which is **more than a decade** - we the people on social media systems could have kept repeating it and defeated Putin's takeover of USA hearts and minds: https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ "Russia and the Menace of Unreality: How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare. By Peter Pomerantsev. At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the **most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.**” It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action." - we should NOW be repeating it every 47 hours over and over, keep repeating, again and again!
