PUTIN_SURKOV_TRUMP_LONG_TERM_YEARS_PLAN The timeline is... Russia claims November 8, 2012 agreement with Trump: "Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.." then the IRA in Q2 2013. Then Donald Trump's private jet to Moscow November 8, 2013. Then December 20, 2013 publican in English language of the global movement https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ then February 20, 2014 the Ukraine war started.

Reddit users suffer from such extreme RECENCY_BIAS they are left feeling that this Russia-USA self-harm to the world is going very fast, but it is not as rapid as people think. The anti-FAQ anti-Wiki favoring of low-effort commenting, users of Reddit are all on different pages of ideas. Scattered, fragmented mindsets. The long-term shifts to anti-empathy pro-war anti-compassion pro-terrorism police state values and wrecking of NATO was in stages. Trump being removed from office and replaced by Joe Biden for 4 years slowed the progress down slightly.

To humiliate the U.S. by showing Article 5 is a joke. Showing the world that NATO is a joke. These are all things... I don't think they add up to a strategy. They end up... sort of checklist of stuff they want to achieve. Sort of a strategy in the sense of.. this is where we want the country to be in 20 years time." - December 5, 2014

The image "they are complicit". They are cult members. Every person on Reddit who says the world "complicit" and "cult" without bothering to quote, link, cite, name nonfiction books is "complicit". If you have the ability to create comments on Reddit, why are you not mentioning Peter Pomerantsev article from October 20, 2011? https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin which talks about media cult creation. Or the September 9, 2014 article by Peter Pomerantsev? https://www.TheAtlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/ which is after the hot Ukraine war started February 20, 2014. If you are focused on protecting girls, why isn't what Putin is doing to abduct and indoctrinate children into private affairs not discussed? Epstein had an island, but Putin has an entire military capturing children and terrorizing children. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war Are you ignorant of the sex trade and systemic rape abuse of girls in Russia? 

* Russia society values... "Back in her home town, in Donetsk(?). Mass gang rapes over a series of days" https://youtu.be/5Au332OG-M4?t=645 "It's normal, it happens to all the girls, no biggie". This is what Donald Trump admires as a society role model / system of society.

That is the toxic popularity. Dumb shit, antics, are what make Reddit media /r/All on ANY TOPIC. If a dog or cat does something dumb and stupid, instantly the photo is on the front-page of Reddit media. That's what Surkov mastered. The title of the Reddit media posting "immediately taint", no - this is how you OWN, win hearts and minds, using hate-watching audiences (Reddit and Bluesky are hate-watching fandoms of MAGA). This is "owning" an event, dominating, rape culture of media cults. Breaking news events to overwrite-reality with hyper-reality. Surkovian techniques.

MEDIA_ECOLOGY_OBSERVATION Here are the typical mass dehumanization messages on Reddit media. Calling cult members of other cults "machine bots" as a way to normalize "non-person" dehumanization. MAGA_VALUES media values of mass dehumanization programming. That "immigrants" are non-person "bots", etc. Using *the cover-fire* ambiguity created by billionaire Grok AI and billionaire ChatGPT and other systems to mask dehumanization. No benefit of doubt that Rupert Murdoch HDTV cult members are real people, all doubt is removed in simple-logic thinking patterns in Reddit fandom. FAKE_DETECTORS are common on Reddit platform. SEE_ALSO my educational subreddit, https://old.reddit.com/r/FakeDetectors which the /r/FakeDetectors subreddit got banned by Reddit owners because I as CALLING OUT people commonly messaging that people were "machine bots", dehumanizing.

People join teams of hate. Hate vs. hate. HATE_VS_HATE of out-groups. Instead of declaring hate as bad, people aggressively promote membership hate of "the others", in this case, "MAGA" / "Joe Biden", etc.

* “Hitlerism was a mass flight to dogma, to the barbaric dogma that had not been expelled with the Romans, the dogma of the tribe, the dogma that gave every man importance only in so far as the tribe was important and he was a member of the tribe.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. Published year 1955.

**The 1954 Equation**

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

By that logic.. anyone who uses billionaire media systems is accountable for Putin, Trump, Israel, etc. Reddit is Corporate America traded and serving shareholders. Any person who hides their real name and accountability and upvotes anonymous messages on Reddit is supporting misinformation and unverified sources. The idea of holding We The People accountable for cocaine drug abuse... why aren't We The People voting to legalize drug use? Alcohol still has raging violence crisis and because it is legal, doesn't have as much cartel (although it funds media systems for power, influence).

https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1rck7tu/25_mexican_national_guard_troops_left_dead_during/o6z0rtu/

If only Reddit fandom of Luigi could see that cartels, at heart are businessmen. They are powerful and wealthy businesses. Anti-compassion anti-empathy organized business. Killing a CEO does not address what We The People should be peer to peer educating, teaching, organizing against. HEALTH_CARE_GAMES the addiction to money and power over the lives of people is a big cartel kick. Same with copyright cartels, music cartels, intellectual property cartels.

2 month Reddit account. Extreme tiny-short commenting mindsets. Elon Musk programmed simple-think Twitter billionaire ideas. Reddit commenting community is a playground of ignorance on history of travel technology, immigration, conflicts. One of the most ignorant statements you could make. The human race is PROUD of bigotry. The clergy for Levant religions have found huge popularity promoting bigotry over favorite science fiction book. BOOK_SUPREMACY bigotry. It is a matter of pride, they have special holidays! Ramadan, Christmas, Easter!

Democracy does not work without "love thy neighbor", "love thy enemy". DEMOCRACY_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITHOUT_LOVE_THY_NEIGHBOR_COMPASSION_VALUES Published year 1988 as lessons from George Lucas to Star Wars science fiction fandom, **nonfiction book**:

CAMPBELL: But in the Bible, eternity withdraws, and nature is corrupt, nature has fallen. In **biblical thinking**, we live in exile.

BILL MOYERS: As we sit here and talk, there is one story after another of car bombings in Beirut — by the Muslims of the Christians, by the Christians of the Muslims, and by the Christians of the Christians. It strikes me that Marshall McLuhan was right when he said that television has made a global village of the world—but he didn’t know the global village would be Beirut. What does that say to you?

CAMPBELL: It says to me that they don’t know how to apply their religious ideas to contemporary life, and **to human beings rather than just to their own community**. It’s a terrible example of the failure of religion to meet the modern world. These three mythologies are fighting it out. **They have disqualified themselves for the future.**

MOYERS: What kind of new myth do we need?

CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual **not with his local group** but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers.

* "All life, all thought, all meditation, is to be governed by the authority of the shepherds of the group \[the Church\]; and **there can be no doubt, from what we know of the history of this tradition**, that this authority was imposed and maintained by force. But any religious **symbol, so interpreted that it refers not to a thought-transcending mystery but to a thought-enveloping social order**, misappropriates to the lower principle the values of the higher and so (to use a theological turn of phrase) sets Satan in the seat of God." - https://TheseThingsInside.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/joseph-campbell-says-religious-literalism-sets-satan-in-the-seat-of-god/
