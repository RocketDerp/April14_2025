If only people cared if the Russian government and USA government were scripted Reality TV for Bluesky and Reddit audiences. It seems almost nobody on Reddit can recall the BBC or use search engines for nonfiction real world. REALITY_REAL

Take for example, Russia vs.Ukraine scripted war for Reddit audiences. Why is this one sentence from the BBC reporting, covering public content from the Russia government, not given the attention of this retail store opening with two people at at door? Why isn't this year 2014 line in news story on the front page of Reddit when war is in the news?

* "But **the key thing was, that Surkov then let it be known that this was what he was doing, which meant that no one was sure what was real or fake**. As one journalist put it: "It is a strategy of power that keeps any opposition constantly confused." A ceaseless shape-shifting that is unstoppable because it is undefinable. It is exactly what Surkov is alleged to have done in the Ukraine this year. In typical fashion, **as the war began, Surkov published a short story** about something he called non-linear war. A war where you never know what the enemy are really up to, or even who they are. The underlying aim, **Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception**, in order to manage and control." - BBC, Adam Curtis. December 31, 2014.
    * Repeating, year 2014: "The underlying aim, **Surkov says, is not to win the war, but to use the conflict to create a constant state of destabilized perception**"
