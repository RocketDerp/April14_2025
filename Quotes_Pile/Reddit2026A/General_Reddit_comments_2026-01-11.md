A complete failure to understand Trump's power. Every single thing Trump does gets Reddit audience on the front page commenting. People on Reddit entirely do not grasp ***MEDIA ECOLOGY**, the ecology of media, and their own deep-seated attraction to Trump's mocking an hate. Trump becomes more powerful with each antic and destructive act because the entire population of over 300 million people in USA are meme addicts. Neil Postman was correct in his year 1985 book.

People chase a paper trail, a "List", the "Epstein List". A Q QAnon 'Q Drop" of information. That's not removal from office. That is not arresting people, prison. That's information addiction. Information strip tease. Audience of Reddit that prizes white men private jet sex dirt. Celebrity trash media addicts.

Constantly casting Trump as a child innocent of choices. Unable to face reality. Reddit society child-washes and joke-washes and dementia-washes Trump. Entertainment addicts.

Reddit meme addicts can't make { Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee } quotes front-page every 4 hours for the next 6 months. Because Reddit audience is addicted to Trump's smell and stink and all the unique style and unique choices Trump makes. Promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee on Reddit more than Epstein would put a light on the brainrot of meme society / entertainment addictions.
