A complete failure to understand Trump's power. Every single thing Trump does gets Reddit audience on the front page commenting. People on Reddit entirely do not grasp ***MEDIA ECOLOGY**, the ecology of media, and their own deep-seated attraction to Trump's mocking an hate. Trump becomes more powerful with each antic and destructive act because the entire population of over 300 million people in USA are meme addicts. Neil Postman was correct in his year 1985 book.

People chase a paper trail, a "List", the "Epstein List". A Q QAnon 'Q Drop" of information. That's not removal from office. That is not arresting people, prison. That's information addiction. Information strip tease. Audience of Reddit that prizes white men private jet sex dirt. Celebrity trash media addicts.

Constantly casting Trump as a child innocent of choices. Unable to face reality. Reddit society child-washes and joke-washes and dementia-washes Trump. Entertainment addicts.

Reddit meme addicts can't make { Jen Senko, Dr. Bandy X Lee } quotes front-page every 4 hours for the next 6 months. Because Reddit audience is addicted to Trump's smell and stink and all the unique style and unique choices Trump makes. Promoting Dr. Bandy X Lee on Reddit more than Epstein would put a light on the brainrot of meme society / entertainment addictions.

Living under sleeping meme addicts who make every minute of every day of life terrible and bad with compulsive addiction to trash ideas and junk information since year 2013 is horrible. Unlike so many in USA, I do not find MAGA suffering to be the greatest entertainment and source of amusement ever experienced. I find it all horrible, sickening, and the very cause of my distress / alarm / sickness! Worshipers of nonsense MAGA values as content for meme mills like Bluesky and Reddit!

Putin started in March 2013 the Reddit joke-washing of the February 20, 2014 Ukraine invasion. Reddit has been one of (if not THE) leading places to humor-wash entertainment-wash Putin and Trump!  Reddit attitude of ignoring people like { Marshall McLuhan, Dr. Bandy X. Lee } is the very cause. The massive audience and cross-posting to other meme mills and real-world conversations that the Internet Research Agency seeded! Denial of extremely serious and important facts: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43301643

It's impossible to describe the quantity of comments that all behave as if this is Reality TV fiction and not real concern to the future of the USA. Meme addictions, media addiction, has wrecked the USA. Neil Postman's 1985 book is essential understanding to 2026 USA crisis!
