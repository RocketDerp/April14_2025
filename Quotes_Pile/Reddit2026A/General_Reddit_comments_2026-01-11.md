A complete failure to understand Trump's power. Every single thing Trump does gets Reddit audience on the front page commenting. People on Reddit entirely do not grasp ***MEDIA ECOLOGY**, the ecology of media, and their own deep-seated attraction to Trump's mocking an hate. Trump becomes more powerful with each antic and destructive act because the entire population of over 300 million people in USA are meme addicts. Neil Postman was correct in his year 1985 book.

Russia and the **Menace of Unreality**   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare   
Peter Pomerantsev   
September 9 2014, 3:42 PM ET   

* “If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is **virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence**. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

Translated from 2013 Russia to USA 2025: I.C.E. raids are very little violence and a lot of showboating. A lot of Reddit front-page I.C.E. raids for visual meme addicts / meme consumers. No recognition that Kremlin and White House has the Reddit total control of media amplifiers. Reddit is amplifying media from all over the Internet. Eating the onions that Trump and Musk is dementia stupid dumb idiot, Reddit society unable to engage and comprehend and understand off-Reddit...

* "which a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult—to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that **everyone has to undergo**. We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone’s protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years — and if you’re going on for your Ph. D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection." - Power of Myth, nonfiction, year 1988

Fiction addicts are who see it that way. Alternate universes, alternate realities, gamers / ARG gamers. Sports mentality, gaming mentality, "winner takes all" logic. 

* “Today, reports of the day’s events are conveyed to the viewing public **by way of alternate universes**, The Fox News cable channel conveys its version of reality, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum MSNBC presents its version. They and their many counterparts on radio are more the result of an economic dynamic than a political one. Dispatching journalists into the field to gather information costs money; hiring a glib bloviator is relatively cheap, and inviting opinionated guests to vent on the air is entirely cost-free. It wouldn’t work if it weren’t popular, and audiences, it turns out, are endlessly absorbed by hearing amplified echoes of their own biases. It’s divisive and damaging to the healthy functioning of our political system, but it’s also indisputably inexpensive and, therefore, good business.” ― Ted Koppel. Lights Out: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath. October 27, 2015. Page 13.

What is realistic is actually teaching love and peace. We no longer listen to good leaders and good teachers. Trump is a meme addict, a TV addict, and it is a common cause to confront our learning problems.

* You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis.

The denial of Fox News HDTV audience behaviors, Twitter Musk changes upon society. Avoidance of Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman's library of books on media ecology. Trump does not deny that fiction outsells nonfiction. Rick Roderick's 1993 lecture "Self Under Siege" has proven true.

Fiction addiction problems go way beyond USA Christianity. People on social media flock to fiction over nonfiction, and it is far less obvious to them than the Church.

And how easily it is to get people to steer it toward child topics instead of adult commenting topics of Reddit.

Note the lack of book quotes, author names, URL off-Reddit, book titles. Reddit is a for-profit corporation too. People prize junk information that billionaires trickle down.

I am repeating the same comment URL, because it ***eats the Surkovian onion*** and think (conditioned mindset) it is accidental to change topics all the time. That shape-shifting isn't the very basis of the winning Russian information warfare since March 2013.

https://youtu.be/5Au332OG-M4?t=785 "mafia state and oligarchy, and we’ve realized **they are illusions, that everything is PR.” “Everything is PR” has become the favorite phrase of the new Russia**; my Moscow peers are filled with a sense that they are both cynical and enlightened. When I ask them about Soviet-era dissidents, like my parents, who fought against communism, they dismiss them as naïve dreamers and my own Western attachment to such vague notions as “human rights” and “freedom” as a blunder. “Can’t you see your own governments are just as bad as ours?” they ask me. I try to protest—but they just smile and pity me. To believe in something and stand by it in this world is derided, the **ability to be a shape-shifter celebrated**. Vladimir Nabokov once described a species of butterfly that at an early stage in its development had to learn how to change colors to hide from predators. The butterfly’s predators had long died off, but still it changed its colors from the sheer pleasure of transformation. Something similar has happened to the Russian elites: during the Soviet period they learned to dissimulate in order to survive; now there is no need to constantly change their colors, but they continue to do so out of a sort of dark joy, conformism raised to the level of aesthetic act. Surkov himself is the ultimate expression of this psychology." ― Peter Pomerantsev, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia.

Punching down on poor people. Rich people can get cosmetic surgery. But punch down with powerful media images, animation techniques, to dehumanize poor people / people without health care / etc. Anything but face up that the problem is Fox News HDTV fiction taken as nonfiction. The problem is Bible fiction storytelling for 1,900 years taken as non-fiction. Quran fiction since year 850 taken as non-fiction.

Alas, USA meme addicts thrive on Twitter as importation for hate and mass dehumanization. The Tech lovers, technology addicts, who cheer on anti-human machine messaging. People will not face up to Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman's library of printed books and film prints.. from the 1960's, 1970's. 1980's and recognize that MAGA values are television addiction behaviors / Twitter addiction behaviors. Educating and teaching Marshall McLuhan / University of Toronto courses - would drastically wake people up to what has ruined society.

Ozzy Osbourne, another content producer, dies at age 76 and there was a huge emotional reaction among the fandoms. Media audiences behave this way. Cults of media content.
