"What Cambridge Analytica observed was that when respondents were angry, their *need for complete and rational explanations was also significantly reduced*. In particular, anger put people in a frame of mind in which they were more indiscriminately punitive, particularly to out-groups. They would also underestimate the risk of negative outcomes. This led Cambridge Analytica to discover that even if a hypothetical **trade war with China or Mexico meant the loss of American jobs and profits**, people primed with anger would tolerate that domestic economic damage if it meant they could use a trade war to punish immigrant groups and urban liberals.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the **Plot to Break** America, **year 2019**

David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is “an extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it’s not transparent or open where it’s coming from, **it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.**”

Paul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. “It brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this **powerful new way**,” David tells me.
