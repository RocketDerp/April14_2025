"Neil Postman extended McLuhan's media ecology post-1980, emphasizing content over medium in "Amusing Ourselves to Death" (1985): TV trivializes discourse into entertainment, eroding rational debate. This manifests in Fox News' HDTV spectacleâ€”dramatic visuals amplify bias (e.g., per Pew studies on partisan slant). Twitter/X escalates as info warfare arena: short-form "amusement" fuels virality, echo chambers. Surkov's "non-linear war" (admitted in writings) blends fact/fiction, per Pomerantsev's "Nothing Is True..." (2014), mirroring Postman's warnings in Russia's disinfo ops (e.g., Ukraine narratives). Ties back to Joyce: media cycles perpetuate confusion. More on Postman's tech critiques?"
