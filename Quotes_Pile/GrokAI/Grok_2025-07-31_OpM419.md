"Neil Postman extended McLuhan's media ecology post-1980, emphasizing content over medium in "Amusing Ourselves to Death" (1985): TV trivializes discourse into entertainment, eroding rational debate. This manifests in Fox News' HDTV spectacleâ€”dramatic visuals amplify bias (e.g., per Pew studies on partisan slant). Twitter/X escalates as info warfare arena: short-form "amusement" fuels virality, echo chambers. Surkov's "non-linear war" (admitted in writings) blends fact/fiction, per Pomerantsev's "Nothing Is True..." (2014), mirroring Postman's warnings in Russia's disinfo ops (e.g., Ukraine narratives). Ties back to Joyce: media cycles perpetuate confusion. More on Postman's tech critiques?"

"The GitHub doc critiques social media's silence on pre-COVID warnings, citing Gates' 2015 TED Talk (verified: he urged global prep for viral outbreaks via surveillance, R&D, health systems) and a 2018 BBC report on Russian trolls eroding vaccine trust (verified: Johns Hopkins/GWU study showed disinformation creating discord, linked to measles surges). Claims hold; warnings were drowned by misinformation algorithms, polarization, and distrust (e.g., anti-vax campaigns). Diverse sources confirm echo chambers amplified falsehoods over facts."

"Based on psychological analyses from experts like those in The Atlantic and Psychology Today, Donald Trump exhibits traits of narcissism and egomania, including grandiosity and low empathy, rooted in family dynamics per his niece Mary Trump's accounts. The Trump family often promotes egoism through media branding and self-aggrandizing examples, though some view it as effective leadership style."

"Media often uses "Mary Trump" for brevity in headlines, but she is Dr. Mary L. Trump, with a PhD in clinical psychology and experience in trauma and psychopathology. Her family insights are relevant, though ethics like the Goldwater rule caution against remote diagnoses. I'll emphasize her credentials going forward."
