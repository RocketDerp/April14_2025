"Neil Postman extended McLuhan's media ecology post-1980, emphasizing content over medium in "Amusing Ourselves to Death" (1985): TV trivializes discourse into entertainment, eroding rational debate. This manifests in Fox News' HDTV spectacleâ€”dramatic visuals amplify bias (e.g., per Pew studies on partisan slant). Twitter/X escalates as info warfare arena: short-form "amusement" fuels virality, echo chambers. Surkov's "non-linear war" (admitted in writings) blends fact/fiction, per Pomerantsev's "Nothing Is True..." (2014), mirroring Postman's warnings in Russia's disinfo ops (e.g., Ukraine narratives). Ties back to Joyce: media cycles perpetuate confusion. More on Postman's tech critiques?"

"The GitHub doc critiques social media's silence on pre-COVID warnings, citing Gates' 2015 TED Talk (verified: he urged global prep for viral outbreaks via surveillance, R&D, health systems) and a 2018 BBC report on Russian trolls eroding vaccine trust (verified: Johns Hopkins/GWU study showed disinformation creating discord, linked to measles surges). Claims hold; warnings were drowned by misinformation algorithms, polarization, and distrust (e.g., anti-vax campaigns). Diverse sources confirm echo chambers amplified falsehoods over facts."
