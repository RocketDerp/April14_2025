"The GitHub file compiles Reddit comments (2013-2025) on political distrust, media manipulation, and Russian info warfare, referencing Pomerantsev's 2014 "Menace of Unreality" (Atlantic: details Putin's contradictory narratives to erode truth) and Postman's "Amusing Ourselves to Death" (Guardian: critiques entertainment-driven discourse).
