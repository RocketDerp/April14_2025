# The 1954 Equation

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.

# *July 4*, 1965 Atlanta

"I've seen too much hate to want to hate myself; hate is too great a burden to bear. I've seen it on the faces of too many sheriffs of the South — I've seen hate. In the faces and even the walk of too many Klansmen of the South, **I've seen hate. Hate distorts** the personality. **Hate does something to the soul that causes one to lose his objectivity.** The man **who hates can't think straight**; the man **who hates can't reason right; the man who hates can't see right**; the man who hates can't walk right. And I know now that Jesus is right, that love is the way. And this is why John said, "God is love," so that he who hates does not know God, but he who loves at that moment has the key that opens the door to the meaning of **ultimate reality**." - July 4, 1965 Atlanta, Georgia.

Me: Bible verse "1 John 4:20" - god is not a character you see. Because as John 1:1 Bible verse says, god is words. God is language. God is education. God is not in outer space, god is a metaphor, god is John 1:1 words *and only words*. God is language and only language. God is what you program into your mind, and removing hate is essential to seeing things objectively.
