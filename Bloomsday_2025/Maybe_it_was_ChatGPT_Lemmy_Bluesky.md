# Maybe it was

ChatGPT 2022 and GPT-4 May 2023  
Reddit to Lemmy due to API fee MNay 2023  
Twitter to Bluesky November 5, 2024 election   

And now in late June 2025 after the big "NO KINGS" protest weekend and now the opening of the Israel = Iran war.

Maybe it was wathing those media events and people not see that Bluesky was no utopia, it was a world where people had massive block lists passed around - people can't even tolerate the existance of people who do not comprehend or do not understand tiny ideas crammed into Twitter-length thinking and reaction images.

Reddit was long-form, but weaponizing the spam filters made actual links on front-page postings disappear. But really the Twitter-length reaction comments dominate Reddit now, people don't even know anymore about the missing long-form spam-filtered keyword hits (longer the message, more likley to hit a spam filter word).

Fundamentally it's time-based delivery engagement.

Engagement due ot recency also creates backlash due to recency.

ChatGPT has no time bais on content, it is still based on the user initiating the visit. WHere content on Bluesky and Lemmy is based on merely turnign on the app

Where as a Lemmy / Reddit community focused on a single topic has people annoyed when low-effort quesiton comes to that topic.

Bottom line is there are people who like to ask quesitons as opposed to read books.

# Confirmation bias by question

By posing questions as opposed to reading, understanding does not expand.

For me, this has been the heart of my social media personal crisis. I started quoting books for this very reason, but the worst part is how people started to react to book quotes:

0. Apahty, insults, claiming out of context tree without forest view.
1. "I'm ordering that book, on my reading list" with no real follow up
2. Questions that are to you as a social media user as opposed to using Google or reading more of the book itself.
3. React-comments that demonstrate misunderstanding of a book saying more than the quote

It's much like Reddit well-communicated (often repeated) that epople react-comment to click-bait headlines of news stories without actually reading the 1 or 2 page story.

That is what I saw with the quotes reactions.

# Blah

I can't write anything, I can't come back and edit this and finish anything.

"We Built This City" - sinking in your fight.

I know what I want - Malala to solve these problems for me, that people listen to Malala - she sees context of human information systems better than almost anyone. Of course, the sreious context she speaks in and audience she draws - still hasn't changed things that much. So that's a huge frustraiton to witness.

There you go, the Malala *not good enough*, MLK Jr. *not good enough*, Recency Bias articulation summed up in one social media screen shot. Time-based news reporting.

We can go to a job and serve coffee day after day, but we can not serve the same media tpic day after day. Newspapers have diffeernt front page every day, not like menu on coffee. But humans DO go to work and do the same reptitive jobs, even paperwork, even making a film or recording a song creative has a lot of reptitive pubishing and technology steps. And the new medium, Bluesky from Twitter November 2024, changes things - but we don't see it until much later.

"Give Peace a Chance" was in Beatles, Yes, other bands. And it's so soft. MLK Jr was doing the harder - act now, it's already too late, Malala too on Jon Stewart show saying WW3 was already here.

We need a "NO KINGS" kind of seriousness about same page goodness.

The antics protests who lay down on streets to stop traffic, who deface public art displays. I disagree with their approach. I'm standing on a street corner every day begging for people to take seriously like "End of world is coming" sign holder. That's the bleeding out torture in this world of apathy. Malala has gone Film Bollywood / Hollywood / TV / fashion fame to balance that. But that's her, a queen of fame from bullet shooting fame. The rest of us who had freedom just get to hold our sign somewhere and say "please understand Neil Postman" 1985.

Mass mind mental breakdowns abound. Pepeople are findking this Iran Israel war exciting news. I see it as a massive failure to have Malala win. Leaders need to renounce their old ways, we have to be able to change minds towards goodness. Goodness isn't popular nor convincing.
