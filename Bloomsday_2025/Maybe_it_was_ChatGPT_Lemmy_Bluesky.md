# Maybe it was

ChatGPT 2022 and GPT-4 May 2023  
Reddit to Lemmy due to API fee MNay 2023  
Twitter to Bluesky November 5, 2024 election   

And now in late June 2025 after the big "NO KINGS" protest weekend and now the opening of the Israel = Iran war.

Maybe it was wathing those media events and people not see that Bluesky was no utopia, it was a world where people had massive block lists passed around - people can't even tolerate the existance of people who do not comprehend or do not understand tiny ideas crammed into Twitter-length thinking and reaction images.

Reddit was long-form, but weaponizing the spam filters made actual links on front-page postings disappear. But really the Twitter-length reaction comments dominate Reddit now, people don't even know anymore about the missing long-form spam-filtered keyword hits (longer the message, more likley to hit a spam filter word).

Fundamentally it's time-based delivery engagement.

Engagement due ot recency also creates backlash due to recency.

ChatGPT has no time bais on content, it is still based on the user initiating the visit. WHere content on Bluesky and Lemmy is based on merely turnign on the app

Where as a Lemmy / Reddit community focused on a single topic has people annoyed when low-effort quesiton comes to that topic.

Bottom line is there are people who like to ask quesitons as opposed to read books.

# Confirmation bias by question

By posing questions as opposed to reading, understanding does not expand.

For me, this has been the heart of my social media personal crisis. I started quoting books for this very reason, but the worst part is how people started to react to book quotes:

0. Apahty, insults, claiming out of context tree without forest view.
1. "I'm ordering that book, on my reading list" with no real follow up
2. Questions that are to you as a social media user as opposed to using Google or reading more of the book itself.
3. React-comments that demonstrate misunderstanding of a book saying more than the quote

It's much like Reddit well-communicated (often repeated) that epople react-comment to click-bait headlines of news stories without actually reading the 1 or 2 page story.

That is what I saw with the quotes reactions.

I can't write anything, I can't come back and edit this and finish anything.

"We Built This City" - sinking in your fight.

I know what I want - Malala to solve these problems for me, that people listen to Malala - she sees context of human information systems better than almost anyone. Of course, the sreious context she speaks in and audience she draws - still hasn't changed things that much. So that's a huge frustraiton to witness.
