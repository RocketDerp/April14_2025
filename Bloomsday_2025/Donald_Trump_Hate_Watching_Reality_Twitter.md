## What was Unleashed 2013 onward

Mark Turnbull said the method was to play on fears, often using front companies to disguise involvement. “You didn’t know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you,” he was recorded saying. “And our job is to **drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else, to understand what are those really, deep-seated** underlying fears, concerns.”

## Dug Deepest into the Subconscious 

Cambridge Analytica dug deeper into mass mind than [Edward Bernays and Dr. Abraham Brill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom) Easter Sunday 1929.

Out-group hate at the core of Levant religions.

Age 83, Skywalker Ranch California, Joycean Joseph Campbell in 1987: 

"They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy."

"Now, **today (1987) there is no out-group anymore on the planet. And the problem of a modern religion is to have such compassion work for the whole of humanity.** But then what happens to the aggression? This is a problem that the world is going to, have to face—because aggression is a natural instinct just as much as, and more immediate than, compassion, and it is always going to be there. It’s a biological fact. Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that’s used in the Old Testament is “the Abomination.” Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it’s an **extreme case that we have in the Bible**, and our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking."

... "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In **bounded communities, aggression is projected outward**. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other. This is the sense of the word “gentile”—the person is not of the same order." (Same with Islam, "Infidel" word)

## Those Are MAGA values

1987, filmed by George Lucas: "Now brotherhood in most of the myths I know of is confined to a bounded community. In **bounded communities, aggression is projected outward**. For example, the ten commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.” Then the next chapter says, “Go into Canaan and kill everybody in it.” That is a bounded field. The myths of participation and love pertain only to the in-group, and the out-group is totally other. This is the sense of the word “gentile”—the person is not of the same order." (Same with Islam, "Infidel" word)

### Deep Cambridge Analytica + Kremlin

"Британские учёные из Cambridge Analytica предложили сделать из 5 тысяч существующих человеческих психотипов - "идеальный образ" возможного сторонника Трампа. Затем.. положить этот образ обратно на всё психотипы и таким образом подобрать универсальный ключик к любому и каждому." - https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.rykov/posts/10210643558675446
