I've probably said it here before in another long form post.

# Conservative vs. Liberal

# Left vs. Right

These have become so non-specific and meaningless.

# Beyond L vs. R and C vs. L

I think we have to go beyond Conservative vs. Liberal, Right vs. Left.

1. Thinking system. Religion vs. science
2. Thinking system. All religions are equal, science fiction, metaphors.
3. Reason thinking, evidence, facts. Non-fiction.
4. Compassion for ALL humans, love for ALL humans.
5. Who owns lands already, newborns not having any place to live, rent-culture / landlord culture. Domination of newly born people.
6. Conserving WHAT exactly?
7. Protecting children from sex abuse, marriage abuse, underage.
8. Protecting ALL people, *WE the PEOPLE* of the entire world, from mind-fuck. Predatory clergy, predatory advertising, predatory Cambridge Analytica, predatory artificial religions, predatory Edward Bernays students, predatory military mind-fucking, predatory science fiction monomyth, predatory fiction, bamboozle, manipulation, clickbait, advertising, marketing. All these are used by dictators / clergy throughout history.
9. War, violence, siege, guns pointed at, military weapons pointed at.
10. Climate change, building collapses, forest fires, pandemics, poison food, preventable disasters.

### Baseline of 1954

The 1954 Equation about hate from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All people, all places, all time periods - hate is bad.

## Name the Place

Name the COUNTRY and VALUES you support. Not left vs. right, capitalism vs. communism vs. socialism. Define a LIST of detailed values. This constant tossing around of "left", "right", "liberal" shows time and time again to be full of misunderstandings.

### What is wrong with Malala?

Specific disagreements, lists, details.

### What is wrong with MLK Jr?

Specific disagreements, lists, details.

# Misc A

It is as if any nation or religion founded on revolution war / violence / killing the non-believer or conquest of native peoples thinks it is their religion tradition, the god-given right to repeat those traditions. This is a GLOBAL problem.

.

During the pandemic, people claimed it was their tradition to allow diseases to spread from airport to airport because of their "belief" in a religion. This is what we are up against, disease spread via airplanes that a religion never had.

.

It is noteworthy that some creative mythology, creative science fiction, has actually brought up these kind of concerns. Like the Klingons in Star Trek  - and their right to be aggressive warriors / murder people they disagree with. "Cultural tradition"

We need to **be serious** about this global.
