I've probably said it here before in another long form post.

# Conservative vs. Liberal

# Left vs. Right

These have become so non-specific and meaningless.

# Beyond L vs. R and C vs. L

I think we have to go beyond Conservative vs. Liberal, Right vs. Left.

1. Thinking system. Religion vs. science
2. Thinking system. All religions are equal, science fiction, metaphors.
3. Reason thinking, evidence, facts. Non-fiction.
4. Compassion for ALL humans, love for ALL humans.
5. Who owns lands already, newborns not having any place to live, rent-culture / landlord culture. Domination of newly born people.
6. Conserving WHAT exactly?
7. Protecting children from sex abuse, marriage abuse, underage.
8. Protectiong ALL people, WE the PEOPLE of the entire world, from mind-fuck. Predatory clergy, predatory advertising, predatory Cambridge Analytica, predator artificail religions, predatory Edward Bernays students, predatory military mind-fucking, predatory scieence fiction monomyth, predatory fiction, bamboozle, manipulation.

### Baseline of 1954

The 1954 Equation about hate from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All people, all places, all time periods - hate is bad.

## Name the Place

Name the COUNTRY and VALUES you support. Not left vs. right, capitalism vs. communism vs. socialism. Define a LIST of detailed values. This constant tossing around of "left", "right", "liberal" shows time and time again to be full of misunderstandings.

### What is wrong with Malala?

### What is wrong with MLK Jr?
