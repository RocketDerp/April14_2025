# Punching Down on Poor

The egomania runaway social media and political culture of Russia, USA, Israel.   
The concpicuous consumption politics of Donald Trump.   
The Middle East Royalty and Donald Trump Middle East Jet set gift values.

## Pandemic mass mind 

The clergy did not organize a after pandemic funeral ritual / wake:

1. we survived, thank you to god for our survival
2. Sorry for those lost, remembering those lost in the scary days, mightmare overcome.
3. Thank you to the essential workers, medical staff, supply chain workers

All these are *good things, goodness itself*, and the absence of goodness for everyday general people is a crisis world-wide.

### Freedom to spread disease

In the rich part of the world, the egomania is that freedom to spread disease and not defend against biological warfare is important. RFK Jr leading the USA health systems, dismanteling defense and detection of disease outbreaks.

# Wealthy Punching Down

Israel, USA, Russia are punching down on the weaker, smaller, poorer. Putin-lead "Conservative Internatioanl 2013" https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

&nbsp;

The poor of the world are consuming those images, films, TV shows, news reports of the rich people every day claiming how much supperior they are and how much better their life is. this has not only feueld an immigraiton crisis it fuels a biological warfare threat.

People raised on religions with a faith in afterlife of heaven.

## Biological Terrorism

Mining a graveyard for deady virus and disease is a lot less expensive than processsing Uranium.  Virus have built-insteal incubation period.

People have been given intuitive hands-on experience of all this during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not high-technology. It has built in stealth. Poor people work at hotels and drive cars and work at or near airports serving food. 

The incentive of "we hate you" punching dwon from the rich to the poor is a breeding ground for biological terroirsm being a inexpensive and easy weapon of mass terrorism agaisnt the rich people jet-set lifetyle.

The MLK Jr. 1954 equation has been ignored. Hate and world wars go hand in hand. 

The world has never had so many airports and the incubation period of viral infection comes form millions of years.

We have created a mass mind mind-fuck values of Putin and Trump media systems. Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, Vlad Putin, all competing to mind-fuck the poor people of the world.

The powerful and wealthy punching down on social media to mock the less educated, the poor lifestyles, by sports stars, by influencers, by politicians, by businessmen, by Elon Musk - is breeding this.

We were warned about this crisis by highly intelligent mass mind observers: https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/03/06/l-esprit-du-terrorisme-par-jean-baudrillard_879920_3382.html
