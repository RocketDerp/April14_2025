# Punching Down on Poor

The egomania runaway social media and political culture of Russia, USA, Israel.   
The conspicuous consumption politics of Donald Trump.   
The Middle East Royalty and Donald Trump Middle East Jet set gift values.

## Pandemic mass mind 

The clergy did not organize a after pandemic funeral ritual / wake:

1. we survived, thank you to god for our survival
2. Sorry for those lost, remembering those lost in the scary days, nightmare overcome.
3. Thank you to the essential workers, medical staff, supply chain workers

All these are *good things, goodness itself*, and the absence of goodness for everyday general people is a crisis world-wide.

### Freedom to spread disease

In the rich part of the world, the egomania is that freedom to spread disease and not defend against biological warfare is important. RFK Jr leading the USA health systems, dismantling defense and detection of disease outbreaks.

# Wealthy Punching Down

Israel, USA, Russia are punching down on the weaker, smaller, poorer. Putin-lead "Conservative International 2013" https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

&nbsp;

The poor of the world are consuming those images, films, TV shows, news reports of the rich people every day claiming how much superior they are and how much better their life is. this has not only fueled an immigration crisis it fuels a biological warfare threat.

People raised on religions with a faith in afterlife of heaven.

## Biological Terrorism

Mining a graveyard for deadly virus and disease is a lot less expensive than processing Uranium.  Virus have built-in stealth incubation period.

People have been given intuitive hands-on experience of all this during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not high-technology. It has built in stealth. Poor people work at hotels and drive cars and work at or near airports serving food. 

The incentive of "we hate you" punching down from the rich to the poor is a breeding ground for biological terrorism being a inexpensive and easy weapon of mass terrorism against the rich people jet-set lifestyle.

The MLK Jr. 1954 equation has been ignored. Hate and world wars go hand in hand. 

The world has never had so many airports and the incubation period of viral infection comes form millions of years.

We have created a mass mind mind-fuck values of Putin and Trump media systems. Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, Vlad Putin, all competing to mind-fuck the poor people of the world.

The powerful and wealthy punching down on social media to mock the less educated, the poor lifestyles, by sports stars, by influencers, by politicians, by businessmen, by Elon Musk - is breeding this.

We were warned about this crisis by highly intelligent mass mind observers: https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/03/06/l-esprit-du-terrorisme-par-jean-baudrillard_879920_3382.html

&nbsp;

Mind-fucking and mentally manipulating the poor to worship the wealthy and powerful game has been going on for a very long time. And insulting and mocking "stupid dumb people" all the time has become the outcome of Cambridge Analytica Internet manipulation of minds.

We are siting on a mass mind powder keg of hate values, hate preaching, "hate harder" messages. Which have even now been programmed into ChatGPT feeding them in private sessions back to people who think that ChatGPT is the new voice of God (John 1:1 large language model) from *cloud computing sky* speaking to them in charming langauge.

It would be ignorant and stupid to deny the mass mind risks we are cultivating and how the 2019 pandemic has created a self-teaching of biological terrorism situation.
