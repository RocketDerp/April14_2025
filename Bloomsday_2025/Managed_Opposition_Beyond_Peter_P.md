"imagine if it was all controled by the Pentagon"

"Incredibly coreographed from the center"

It it worse now. Monomyth stories take on a life of their own. The "War Against Reality" can take on a life of it's own.

1. Does not need a director
2. Can be seeded like a virus disease outbreak, but does not need "active measures" to spread it, but it can be accelerated.
3. "For the Lulz" - humor, gallows humor, is self-exploiting, self motivation runaway. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec
4. Runaway self-exploiting humor is 1985 Neil Postman's social theory of media ecology. https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley

Back to Peter P:

"The War of All Against All"

That's what Joseph Campbell, Marshall McLuhan both converge on with James Joyce.

“World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.” – Marshall McLuhan (1970), Culture is Our Business, p. 66.

Peter came from Russia where total control of media allowed a top-down programming where the opposition was coordinated, simulacra.

Whet isn't being faced up to here is that religions were always simulacra, based off the fiction of the Bible, Quran, Torah itself.

Churches are not directed to be built, they rise up off of "mind-virus" (using Elon Musk's term) community activity of people who desire one like a park for their children to play in their neighborhood.

Forking of church ideology, Baptists protestant vs. Lutheran protestant is not directed as much as tradition and family lines in choice marriages.

There comes a time when *fan fiction* takes on a life of it's own.

Mohammad's Quran is fan-fiction of the Torah and Bible. Jesus and Mary are in the story, clearly Mohammad knew of and was educated on Bible Stories. Adam and Eve are in the Quran, Noah's Ark story is in the Quran.

Bible verse Romans 11:32 even gives full permission to break any rules, including retcon of the Bible stories - Mohammad removed Joseph, the husband of Mary - who is absent in the Quran retelling of the story of Jesus. Romans 11:32 is an escape hatch to the fixed words of The Bible. Founding Father of USA Thomas Jefferson in year 1820 published his own edited version https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible of The Bible, removing the supernatural.

No organization directed Mohammad to be "an opposition party" to the Christians and Jewish.

Compulsive media behavior, love of the story, *how crowds are attracted to the story* is the "take on a life of it's own" aspect of media ecology.

How many people today out of all the world (over 8 billion population) claim they hear the voice of God in their head. 

Was Mohammad's cave like a Navajo Sweat Lodge. Was Jesus's story of being in the desert heat fasting and mental states of dream-like creative storytelling.

As an aside: Joseph Campbell was not only a Joycean who wrote an entire book on Finnegans Wake, he married a Joycean. Two Joyce experts in one marriage.

## "Voice of God in my Head"

What is it that creative storytelling, fiction writers of monomyth order, are hearing?

This lecture is critical to this understanding:

And also physical brain changes, such as LSD drug, that classic religion study did not have.

Marshall McLuhan DID have access to Canadian students who were using the new LSD drug and directly contrasted it to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake poetry and oral reading:

So now we can dose someone with LSD.  Joseph Campbell also covered LSD.

MOYERS: Often with the help of a drug.

CAMPBELL: Yes. The mechanically induced mystical experience is what you have there. I have attended a number of psychological conferences dealing with this whole problem of the difference between the mystical experience and the psychological crack-up. The difference is that the one who cracks up is drowning in the water in which the mystic swims. You have to be prepared for this experience.

MOYERS: You talk about this peyote culture emerging and becoming dominant among Indians as a consequence of the loss of the buffalo and their earlier way of life.

CAMPBELL: Yes. Ours is one of the worst histories in relation to the native peoples of any civilized nation. They are nonpersons. They are not even reckoned in the statistics of the voting population of the United States.

=====

CAMPBELL: Oh, we definitely have. Our thinking is largely discursive, verbal, linear. There is more reality in an image than in a word.

MOYERS: Do you ever think that it is this absence of the religious experience of ecstasy, of joy, this denial of transcendence in our society, that has turned so many young people to the **use of drugs**?

CAMPBELL: Absolutely. That is the way in.

MOYERS: The way in?

CAMPBELL: To an experience.

## My point with drugs

We basically KNOW what is inside the subconsious now, we can drug people and they hear the "voice of god", but it was already there before the drugs. 

The **message is not in the drug pill itself**, the message is in the human brain, *dreams*.

That's where Finnegans Wake comes in.

And again: https://www.wnyc.org/story/dr-joseph-campbell-inward-journey-schizophrenia-and-mythology/

What in the 1960's was called "Essential schizophrenia" (as opposed to "Paranoid Schizophrenia") is more the drug-like experienxe *without the drugs*.

## Again, my point with drugs

How many people 2000 years ago claimed they heard the voice of God. Thousands and thouands. Popularity of the stoyr is key.

How many science fiction stories are published that nobody liked at the Time. Stories that soemtimes ar enot found until 50 years after an author is dead.  https://www.jta.org/2024/07/18/ideas/100-years-after-his-death-gen-z-loves-franz-kafka-now-they-ought-to-read-him-too

Phillip K Dick and L Ron Hubbard are modern science fiction example writers. Able to produce many stories.

&nbsp;

Rick Roderick discusses Gulf War and Jean B in 1993, so simulacra and emerging non-reality was already being described by someone entirely outside of Neil Postman / Marshall McLuhan sphere of media ecology.

What Russia was doing, what Peter P was doing, was seeding monomyth patterns. They thought they could control it.

Nowmore than ever, with all Internet Research Agency (and who knows what other organizations) working with Cambridge Analytica - the year 2013 explosion of exporting this on the Internet. https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/11/24/a-trumprussia-confession-in-plain-sight/

Even if that story is fiction, proves to be false that Trump and Kremlin worked together with Cambridge Analytica - they were working in the same time periods.

### Before ChatGPT 2022, the Pandemic 2019

https://www.BBC.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192

Augusts 24, 2018 - documented monomyth patterns in the wild. Devil vs. God fiction, arguing back and forth, disagreeing with each other, forming the same mental patterns as monomyth.

### The stubbrn denial of fiction

Religion people, monomyth believers, have a very stubborn denial that science fiction is their attraction. Fiction vs. nonfiction preferences.

The map of all the falsehoods people believe. Fake moon landing, flat earth, disease theories (without a microscope), evolution of life on Earth (without DNA microscopes evidence)... even when you SHOW people with a microscope, they still stick to their denial. Even when you fly people around the Earth or into space to see the earth - they still stick with their denial. Which is what religion science fiction does, what religion patterns (monomyth patterns) can do.

This is what Russia and CA seeded since 2013. The Kremlin seeded artificial religions (Surkov monomyth story patterns).

Do we not see this anti-science stubborn, anti-reality behavior with pandemic. But I argue that we, we society, did not take it serious. We should have seriously produced and funded dozens of YouTube / TV shows about how vaccinations are made, how the virus looks under microscopes, why it is novel / the difference. And FAQ style education. There was very very little of this. We had 11 months between escape of Wuhan and the vaccination, all that could have been ready by August 2020 - 3 to 5 months of video production. And books about 1918 pandemic turned into 

"We were lucky" it wasn't more deadly message in late 2020 - we did not KNOW how deadly in March 2020 - it could have been MORE deadly and people forget that *we humans learn as we go*, more people had seem the outcome of the virus but in the early months February 2020 - we didn't know it wasn't that deadly. (redundant writing intentional, needs editing as all this does)

### Then Came ChatGPT

Then in 2022 put on the public Internet was large language models *trained on* that weaponized Cambridge Analytica and Russian Internet Research Agency since 2013 message content that has become embedded in human minds and output in original (each person's writing) forms.

## Runaway Simulacras

Trumpism is a runaway MonoMyth (Fox News "x" marks the spot of a wealth lord / land lord, that Donald Trump stepped into the "x" placeholder that had been built-up in the entertainment amusement (Neil Postman) mythology of Rupert Murdoch) AND a runaway Internet Research Agency simulacra combined.
