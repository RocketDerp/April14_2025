# War Agaisnt Reality That

War Against Reality that nobody can focus on or sustain self-awareness on because it is reality itself.

We saw this with the pandemic anti-science (which was an Internet Research Ageny mind-fuck target since 2013).

It was called the "Infodemic" during the pandemic, but people still never cited the August 24, 2018 Johns Hopkins Unviersity / George Washington University disclosures about how serious the Russia mind-fuck was. The War Against Reality does not like to face mythology. Peter P doesn't like to face the monomyth / religions / scientology / cults outside political ones. 

What Surkov unleashed, what Operation Matthew 4:19 unleashed, is fiction so compelling people enjoy debating the story tellements so much. The timeline of release parallels the rise of Malala... and you can see people give ceremony and thank you to Malal, but doesn't seem able to grasp the depth of the religion interpretation crisis she is addressing. She is the biggest women's right equality hounder at the Joseph Campbell / Bill Moyers 1987 Power of Myth Level. She does not see Allah as a man ruler, dictator, and her father being a teacher has allowed her to threate the entire family with free thinking. She has sai outrageous things, and in high places.

Supporting Malala is supporting free thinking, libertion of women from ALL religions. This rose to the public in 2013, just as Operation Matthew 4:19 was kciking off in Russia in March 2013. You can parallel the attraction to fiction, when Malala is a huge advocate for non-fiction. Malala wants to dilute the Quran fiction with non-fiction. With authentic love and address the "1 John 4:20" crisis of people *in love* with God/Allah so much they kill human persons. This is a massive historic shift. And she has picked up and even spoken at MLK Jr's Church. She is a hard-core humanist who speaks the clergy languages.

Malala is rescue of rality, Trump is a promoter of fiction storytelling about everything and anything. Malala wants her fiction confined to the cinemea and the Mosque, Trumpism wants the fiction to rule over all our lives with RFK Jr even ruling over our health with fiction.  Malala is not for fiction-based health care like Trumpism / MAGA.

People can not even see this contrast. Reformer of fiction is what I view Malala as. She is sincere, earnest, serious, creative. She is the teacher of teachers, teachers of politicians / clergery / leaders / business owners. 

Yet, Donald Trump is the template and role model since 2013 - people adopt and copy his success and even was they mock and insult him - adopt his values of mocking, insuting, hate.
