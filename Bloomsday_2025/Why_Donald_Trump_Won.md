Typical June 2025 narative:

"He won because of apathetic voters, terrible optics for the Democrats, and lackluster candidates. The only way anything gets better is if people care and vote. I also believe that if the DNC hadn't forced Hilary as the candidate in 2016, Trump would have lost to Bernie and faded back into obscurity."

# [Mass Denial Abounds](https://mastodon.social/tags/DenialAbounds)

1. Neil Postamn's 1985 media ecology social theory. "Amusing Ourselves To Death" about Ronald Regan in 1985 and the future Apple iPhone (year 2007) world.
2. "Conservative International 2013" agenda.
3. Multiple nations, not just the USA
4. Multiple states, multiple people, not just Donald Trump. Population-wide change.
5. Denial of Peter P's work, nobody disussed it. Domestic only focus. Peter started in UK. British exit from EU.
6. Denial of "War Against Reality"
7. Denial of 1954 Equation about hate, the outcome of the war against reality is most often hate the out-groups, and how it impacts interpretaiton. Us vs. Them.
8. Russia is self-harming too, there is no winning in the Ukraine war. It isa morally bankrupt, it is runaway monomyth mind-fuck, it is self-harm just as USA is now self-harm.

This is an exposion of artificail religons. Denial of the history of religons, denial of the crisis of loyalty to fiction, loyalty to fiction storyteelling and religons.

Fox News problem, denial of social media not getting on the same page to GET RID OF the problem. Instead, people act like there is nothing they can do and do not even try to invoke Neil Postman's 1985 book against the Fox News.

Why can social media users not stay focused?  
Why can social media users not stay on a serious and important topic?   
Streaming meme services, amusement mills, recency bias, always *new fresh this hour* and no sustained focus.

# Crisis Of

Crisis of not focusing on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad

Jen Senko is *from We The People*, serious, sincere, earnest, cottage business, small businessperson. Everything Donald Trump does not represent. Why can people not assert her work? If thre are flaws in her work, augment and supplement using social media and Internet free media systems like Reddit and Lemmy. We have had since 2016 to focus on the Fox News probelm using David vs Golliath tactics of Jen Senko.

But like Malala, we have a crisis of not standing up for the Little Guy and flocking to popularity, The Big Guy. We keep *crating the mainsttream social media*, to feed the Fox News media.
