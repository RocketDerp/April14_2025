"Good headline. It would be great the Democrats would adopt something that straightforward as one of their anti-Trump messages, but they can't seem to come up with anything easy to understand."

Never blaming We The People. Never blaming lack of resistance and fighting the Russian War Against Relaity that started in March 2013 (Internet Research Agency). Blaming the "Democrats Party" instead of facing up to the socidty-wide populaiton-wide all ages (age 12 to 120), all demographics problem described by Neil Postman in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death".

1. Americans, We The People USA, do not realize we have lost an Information War (War Against Reality) to russia.

2. Peter Pomerantsev has been ignored by the population when his writings and videos should be a daily topic until the complete abandonment of Fox News and MAGA values. Peter Pomerantsev should be a household name in USA, should have been since 2016.

3. Neil Postman not a household name and dialy topic in regard to MAGA and Donald Trump White House / Elon Musk Twitter and DOGE, etc.

4. Adam Curtis, BBC: ["where nothing really makes any coherent sense. We live with a constant vaudeville of contradictory stories that makes it impossible for any real opposition to emerge, because they can't counter it with any coherent narrative of their own."](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html) - December 31, 2014 (this is based on Peter Pomerantsev's book from earlier in 2014).

Even more blunt:

1. This type of condtioned thinking of two and only two-party reaction, bi-polar, left vs. right, us vs. them
2. Inside the 5,000 simulacra patterns created as part of "Operation Matthew 4:19" that launched March 2013, and was planned in November 2012.
3. Instead of facing the Twiter-thinking of society, the reactionary condtioned media ecology crisis, still thinking in terms of *political parties*. The information warfare has wrecked human brains, *thinking systems*, to be simplsitic, logic (out-group), anti-reason thinking. Twitter-thinking, reacting A to B, B to A, is the problem. All inclusive, ALL political parties. Information warfare of the monomyth meme patterns is a *fiction vs. non-fiction crisis*, world-wide and global. Not just USA. It is self-harm anti-reality to all humanity.
4. Context Blidnness of DEPTH of the problem. We are into complete loss of language, comprehension, understanding as outcome of "Operation Matthew 4:19" information war. We are up to the problems of 1968 "War and Peace in the Global Village" by Marshall McLuhan, James Joyce's patterns, the Tower of Babel depth in the human brain. This war damaged DEEP since March 2013.
5. Context Blidnness of WHO IS IMPACTED by the problem, timeframes. Donald Trump and the Trump Family do not grasp Kremlin Surkov information warfare, Peter P's writings. Simulacra comprehension.
6. Context Blidnness of global human brain issues on this, beyond just USA and our geography. Why Malala is asserting education. This isn't just a "Democrats Party" issue, this is a world-wide crisis of comprehension. And that needs to be articulated / discussed openly and fequently. The WHOLE WORLD is at stake with the anti-goodness of the Trumpism / MAGA movement.
