# Defining Characteristics 

1. “One characteristic of those who live in a Technopoly is that they are largely unaware of both the origins and the effects of their technologies.”
― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology, 1992
2. Marshall McLuhan 1967 emphasis on how people inside *new media enviornment* can not recognize that the new medium is altering them, as they discuss the old medium. In this case, the pre-Surkov Siege. The Normal USA politics before the November 2012 Trump Twitter domination. Video clip: https://mastodon.social/@RoundSparrow/114060057630873515

5. Not being able to cite / associate / quote Peter Pomerantsev as to to the situation.
6.

# Traps List 1

1. Calling others stupid, idiot, dumb without taking into account the history of what Marshall McLuhan is saying about "the new medium". It is critical to think in terms of: trivializing, complexity, understanding, comprehending. And not just declaring people hopelessly stupid idiots. Abandon insulting, and face up to common ground needs and the huge amount of labor. Think like Malala.
2. Context Blindness induced by exhaustion, avoidance, one-upmanship, egoism, competition of learning, complexity. Rick Roderick talks about banalization of complexity, dismissal, deflationary. (Defined by Rick Roderick, 1993)
