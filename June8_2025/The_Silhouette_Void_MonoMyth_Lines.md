Seams / Lines / Gaps / Continental Divides / Oceans in-between   
Rivers that care through the lands, even in the dry areas of the Grand Canyon    

* "James Joyce frequently used the River Liffey as a powerful, flowing symbol of Dublin and life itself, describing it in Ulysses as carrying bodies, dreams, and history, famously portraying it as a womb and a path, like when Bloom imagines his body buoyant and cleansed in its waters or when characters navigate its currents past city landmarks, symbolizing personal journeys and the city's soul." - Google Search 2026-01-21 morning USA

The ***silhouette void*** that is formed when you keep circling around the vocabulary and ideas of a topic. Repeating circles, recirculation, circling and revisiting and re-circling from angles. OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EePInwd1Qi4 250,051 views April 10, 2020 ... COVID-2019 months

"The Silhouette Void" MonoMyth Lines    

* BILL MOYERS: Aren’t you undermining one of the **great traditional doctrines** of the classic Christian faith — that the burial and the resurrection of Jesus prefigures our own?
CAMPBELL: That would be a mistake in the reading of the symbol. That is reading the words in terms of prose instead of in terms of poetry, reading the metaphor in terms of the denotation instead of the connotation.
MOYERS: And **poetry gets to the unseen** reality.
CAMPBELL: That which is beyond even **the concept of reality**, that which transcends all thought. The myth puts you there all the time, gives you **a line** to connect with that mystery which you are.
