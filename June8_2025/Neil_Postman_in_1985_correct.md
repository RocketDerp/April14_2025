# What went wrong in USA society

What started the cascade: ignoring Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business".

From there, other important things were ignored.

1988 book "Power of Myth" filmed by George Lucas as a lesson to audiences.

1993 lecture by Rick Roderick analyzing the future to come, concluding much of what Neil Postman had described in 1985 without using any of Neil Postman's or Marshall McLuhan's work. An indepedent analysis that leads to many of the same conclusions.

# Recency Bias became routine

Twitter, Reddit, Bluesky, Facebook social media all promote fresh content. Streaming memes from many sources, "the latest", "the newest" information first. This cultivated **recency bias**, a popular topic like a 4 months sports season for Basketball, Football, Baseball, FIFA - would get constant focus and attenton, when older ideas like Neil Postman's 1985 book or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's 1954 equation about hate get drowned in the stream of fresh and recent.

Eventually it reached a point where 500 people commenting the same reaction-comments to events was the normal and people were not connecting current events to past teachers (such as Neil Postman and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr) for greater context.

It became a constant focus on desired trees and many similar messages and ideas about those same trees, with resulting context bewilderment when discussions about the "Big Picture" and "Forest for the Trees".
