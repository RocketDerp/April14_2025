Russia and the Menace of Unreality   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

In the USA, the press is not controlled directly like year 2012 Russia. And there is much more world press coverage, from New Zealand, Austrlia, etc, etc.

Compuslive crowd reactions, mass man reactions. Directing the audience.

"Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers."

Popularity itself, trending, measured click-through, audience tracking feedback loops. Instead of "through his total control of television" year 2012 domestic Russia, it is runaway monomyth compulsive behavior. Surkov dug so deep into ficton and public relations (Edward Bernays), that he has reached the depths of Bible, Quran, Torah compuslive. The clergy can rise up anywhere, the Mosques / Church / Synagogue / Temple / Fox News wealth televagelism venue is compuslively built and funded by the audience itself. Social media and classic news media hybrid interaction. And then came ChatGPT in year 2022.

# I declare: Runaway situation

I declare this to be a "runaway monomyth"   
I declare this to be a "runaway simualcra"

What started with 5,000 hand-crafted:

1. Monomyth artificial religions
2. Monomyth compelling fiction story patterns
3. Alternate reality screen games for electric media environments (news comment sections, social media, blogs, websites)
4. Anti-reality patterns

Has now since year 2022 become runaway, run amock. 

"Operation Matthew 4:19" global seeding in March 2013 has now been fed into training of artificial intelligence, trainig of large laungage models, generative AI has gone beyond the 5,000 patterns.
