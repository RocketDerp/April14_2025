Russia and the Menace of Unreality   
How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare

“If previous authoritarian regimes were three parts violence and one part propaganda,” argues Igor Yakovenko, a professor of journalism at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, “this one is virtually all propaganda and relatively little violence. Putin only needs to make a few arrests—and then amplify the message through his total control of television.”

In the USA, the press is not controlled directly like year 2012 Russia. And there is much more world press coverage, from New Zealand, Austrlia, etc, etc.

Compuslive crowd reactions, mass man reactions. Directing the audience.

"Someone sold the thought that Western media, which specifically have to align their interests with their audience, won't be able to ignore saturated pro-Russian campaigns and will have to change the tone of their Russia coverage to placate their angry readers."

Popularity itself, trending, measured click-through, audience tracking feedback loops. Instead of "through his total control of television" year 2012 domestic Russia, it is runaway monomyth compulsive behavior. Surkov dug so deep into ficton and public relations (Edward Bernays), that he has reached the depths of Bible, Quran, Torah compuslive. The clergy can rise up anywhere, the Mosques / Church / Synagogue / Temple / Fox News wealth televagelism venue is compuslively built and funded by the audience itself. Social media and classic news media hybrid interaction. And then came ChatGPT in year 2022.

## This is compuslive MassMan audience-driven

"Nine has today confirmed the launch of a new international bureau in Washington D.C., marking a major expansion of its news-gathering operations in North America." "Positioned just 300 metres from the White House, the move will provide Aussies with closer on-the-ground coverage of U.S. politics and global affairs."

Just one week before her becoming world famous for being shot on the streets, Lauren Tomasi was hired to work 0.3 kilometers from President Donald Trump, the eye of the symbolism monomyth thunderstorms.

# I declare: Runaway situation

I declare this to be a "runaway monomyth"   
I declare this to be a "runaway simualcra"

What started with 5,000 hand-crafted:

1. Monomyth artificial religions (absent of compassion for out-groups)
2. Monomyth compelling fiction story patterns
3. Alternate reality screen games for electric media environments (news comment sections, social media, blogs, websites)
4. Anti-reality patterns

Has now since year 2022 become runaway, run amock. 

"Operation Matthew 4:19" global seeding in March 2013 has now been fed into training of artificial intelligence, trainig of large laungage models, generative AI has gone beyond the 5,000 patterns.

What I am saying here is that Putin / Kremlin / Russia no longer is in control. In fact, domestic Russia has been self-harming with compuslive monomyth patterns it does not fully comprehend. These are absent of compassion, a threat to the whole world, the *patterns* of monomyth unleashed are of military boot-camp order, weaponized out-group distance bombing (airplaine operatators dropping from sky, rocket builders, drone makers, IDBM button programmers). Detachment from reality, as the world has been under religons and only briefly grasped with the introduction of James Joyce's work and Joseph Campbell's depth and comprehension of Comparative Mythology / Marshall McLuhan's 1968 "War and Peace in the Global Village" and media ecology teachings (John 1:1 - The Bible is languages and only languages. John 1:1 - Torah is poetry and only poetry. Hard for many to swallow, science fiction poetry. Compusive brain addiction to same.)

What I am saying here is that Donald Trump and Putin are not in control. Nor is any one large language model nor is long-form social media users like Reddit and Lemmy, as Twitter-thinking reaction comments have overrrun those platforms too. People favor the Twitter-length repetitive replies and the reaction images on all platforms. Social media amusement track.

Neil Postman's 1985 "Amusing Ourseles To Death", after Ronald Regan elected twice, focused on the ***compusive behavior*** not just the single President Ronald Regagan. And Rick Roderick explained the same in 1993, it can be ridden like a wave (Madonna given as example in his lecture).

Trump and Putin do not realize what they have unleashed, they are compusively amplyfing it.

## The Ultimate Troll, verse Matthew 4:19

As an aside within multiple asides: There is only one outcome worth screaming and standing up for. Pale Blue Dot comprehension, heaven itself, willing to die for heaven on Earth as a realized public dream. Heaven is a public dream. Utopia is a public dream. So, too, are wars in space - lots of science fiction violence. Which is worth killing and death for?

When did we every fully escape the heaven metaphor? How can someone raise children, birth children, without that agenda and objective?

Is endless war a fantasy objective serial killers of humanity all agree on?
