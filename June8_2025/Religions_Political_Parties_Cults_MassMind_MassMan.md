# Military Boot Camp

Military boot camp, the world over, in wartime. Be it Japan 1943 or USA 1944 - very different cultures and religions, yet militay boot camp of turning everyday rice farmers (Japan) and everyday corn farmers (USA) into murders and killers of human beings wearing diffeerent uniforms and waving different national flags.

We do not study the psycology of this sports mentality.

# Religions hating other religions

When religions split and become hate-filleed and violent against "the others". Gentile, infidel, non-believer treatment. Mob mentality of gorup membership in religions.
