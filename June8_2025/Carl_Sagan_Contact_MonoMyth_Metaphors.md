Humanism values observations in the story

1. When Father Joss confronts the head hancho at the party, he says pursuit of truth is a goal in both religion and science. Joseph Campbell has a lecture "New Horizons" that frames it that way.

2. Inner Drive / Dreams / Public Dreams are not really science, language can't connect that way. That's the ending congress public hearing.

3. The violence is bad, the bombing of the first machine in Florida.

4. But people are willing to die for machines.

Passengers willing to die in space travel. Car passengers willing to die, but airplane passengers less so. Lots of monomyth dream themes on what is acceptable and routine way to die.

Drunk driving deaths, avoidable, but slower to get home with a Taxi and get your car back, etc.

Musing all over on this page I'm authoring ;)
