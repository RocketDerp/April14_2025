Humanism values observations in the story

1. When Father Joss confronts the head hancho at the party, he says pursuit of truth is a goal in both religion and science. Joseph Campbell has a lecture "New Horizons" that frames it that way.

2. Inner Drive / Dreams / Public Dreams are not really science, language can't connect that way. That's the ending congress public hearing.

3. The violence is bad, the bombing of the first machine in Florida.

4. But people are willing to die for machines.

Passengers willing to die in space travel. Car passengers willing to die, but airplane passengers less so. Lots of monomyth dream themes on what is acceptable and routine way to die.

Drunk driving deaths, avoidable, but slower to get home with a Taxi and get your car back, etc.

Musing all over on this page I'm authoring ;)

## What is Contact Story

Fiction from a non-fiction science teacher. He understood metaphors, the Joseph Campbell Fiction / Non-Fiction atheist equation.

[Creative Mythology is Volume IV of the comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell's The Masks of God. The book concerns "creative mythology", Campbell's term for the efforts by an individual to communicate his experience through signs, an attempt that can become "living myth".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Mythology)

# The Metaphor Crisis Equation

https://lemm.ee/post/59340405

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

Carl Sagan expresed this equation comprehension with Contact story.
