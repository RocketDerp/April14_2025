# The 1954 Equation

"The 1954 Equation"

"I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong. It's wrong to throw our lives away in riotous living. No matter if everybody in Detroit is doing it, it's wrong. It always will be wrong, and it always has been wrong. It's wrong in every age and it's wrong in every nation. Some things are right and some things are wrong, no matter if everybody is doing the contrary. Some things in this universe are absolute." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

# Why 1954 ?

1. Ten years after World War Two, Japan attacking USA, Germany, muclear bomb creation.

2. Airports and airplanes technology now allows faster exchange of information

3. Film, audio recordings, photographs. Now allows faster exchange of information.

In 1954 it was now more obvious that **hate is a global problem**, regardless of the skin color, race, gender, geography, nation, religion, economic system, politics.

More from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr on hate: "We usually think of what hate does for the individual hated or the individuals hated or the groups hated. But it is even more tragic, it is even more ruinous and injurious to the individual who hates. You just begin hating somebody, and you will begin to do irrational things. You can't see straight when you hate. You can't walk straight when you hate. You can't stand upright. Your vision is distorted. There is nothing more tragic than to see an individual whose heart is filled with hate. He comes to the point that he becomes a pathological case. For the person who hates, you can stand up and see a person and that person can be beautiful, and you will call them ugly. For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true. That's what hate does. You can't see right. The symbol of objectivity is lost."

Hate is a mental state that favors more hate. When a person holds hate in their brain, they prize hate, they value hate, they organize and form groups and organizations with hate in mind.

# We Teach Each Other, Influencers 

We teach hate to each other. 
We teach revenge to each other.  
We teach "payback" to each other.  
We teach and influence each other.  

When we prize hate, when we people wield hate as a weapon and cultivate hate, we are teaching each other more hate. We are teaching *hate harder* asa value. We are networking hate, peer to peer, and it reflects in our collective mindsets and collective outcomes. Hate aggregates to become street gangs of hate, virtual clubs of hate, and war between religions, war between nations, war between races, war between genders.

We accept war between nations, war between groups of people, we accept hate.

We have not developed "fire drills", "disaster drills" when hate starts to network or there are outbreaks of hate. We don't think of it as an infection or disease that spreads. We don't treat it with education and teaching, we actually do worse things like elect hate leaders to wage war and violence. In a mental state of hate, we become attracted to more and more hate to a point of world-wide self-destructiion.

We praise those who die in the name of war and hate as heroes. We often ridicule and insult those who die in the name of trying to teach hate is bad, we mock and ridicule those as nieve and gullable who try to walk up to angry weapon systems and armed people with books, words, ideas. Dean in the name of absurd goodness we insult, death in the name of killing "the enemy" (other human beings we hate, who hate us back) we call brave and heroic. 

Fighting hate in the mind is not easy. Living in a war zone and resisting hate is not easy. It is painful. It is suffering. Instead of being drawn to death to end the suffering, to die in honor, it is often more painful to stand up to hate itself. Even those who do so peacefully, like Malala in Swat Valley Pakistan - who was writing on the Internet about how hate wa bad, got shot on her school bus. Shot in the head.

# 1954 Equation population

Another aspect of having airports and world travel, we also have now in year 2025 over 8 billion people. How many hate cheerleaders can we get away with? How many Vladimire Putin leaders can we have before weapon systems and techology to kill and wreck the world start killing hundreds of millions of people?

How does living under the stress of new hate outbreaks impact our lives? How much great art, music, friendships are lost because we can not travel and share plates of food with each other, because of war zones, hate-based values, hate between people?

Even online, blocking and firewalling out person to person contact, how much are good ideas being lost in the wrong side of the hate equation? Digital media block button are the modern book burning, they did not have Unicode text and digital images in Nazi Germany 1933.

In fiction we can express murder, genocide, warfare. Popular films like Star Wars 1977 depict an entire planet being destroyed by a weapon platform. So we can not eliminate the worst expressions of hate ideas, hate concepts, hate techniques, weapon systems plans. Fiction storytelling allows hate to be expressed, as the "bad guys" who are in the story.

We must distinguish fiction from non-fiction and assert in the real world reality we desire to end hate, to solve hate, to help each other when suffering hate in our minds.

Electing Donald Trump, electing Vladimir Putin - these are aggregations of hate (and hate values), accumulations of hate. We must help each other with morality lessons, moral teaching, we must convince each other that love and compassion are values worth laboring on. We orginate love and compassion, and we must do so when hate breaks out.
