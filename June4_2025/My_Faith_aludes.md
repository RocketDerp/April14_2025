hashtag # MyFaith my faith system is alluded to in the 1940 film "The Great Dictator" about where technology is discussed.

"In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. "

And when I see people in Russia, Israel and other places die from house fires, earthquakes, floods, car accidents, airplane accidents, preventable diseases, food preparation accidents - I think humanity has failed to solve # The1954Equation from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr about ALL hate in ALL places is bad and needs to be eliminated using education. Hate is bad.

Humanity is spending far too much effort in hate and anti-goodness, war, bombing, terrorism. 

We need to deal with the "mass mind" and # MassPsychosis problems.

It is also my faith that many individual and family mental health problems, domestic violence are the result of the society itself not taking seriously the role of "Mass Psychosis" of the group. People living in war zones, PTSD, etc People who # PrizeHate prize hate as a tool to harm others, cause brain damage.
