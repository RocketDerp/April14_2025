We The World, We The People   
Are one technology away from media disaster 

Falsehoods are out of control in year 2025.   
Long-festering problems with fiction vs. nonfiction.  
Religions, cults, mythology: the metaphor problem.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

# Elon Musk "Mind Virus"

Billionaire Elon Musk is admitting that billionaires manipulate mind virus in the population.

# There is no supernatural

There is no supernatural, all cults and religions are media. That includes Elon Musk on Twitter.

# New Media Technology

A new media technology is going to be pounced-on year 2025 and onward. If a new exciting social media or streaming media / streaming meme system takes off, billionaires are going to pounce on it. Truth Social by Donald Trump, Elon Musk purchase of Twitter - the trend is in place. Everything is media ecology now.

This is the era of Media Ecology. Previously, emerging media was mostly there for advertising and such, but now with Trump's success, new tech of media is recognized as something to keep serious eyes on. Way more than before.

Running society. Not as a sector of society, but as the core political system in a Surkov / Surkovian.

Cambridge Analytica and the Kremlin in "Operation Matthew 4:19" have proven deeper than The Bible. Even Donald Trump can sell a Bible and no clergy invokes Matthew 6:5 verse on the front page of social media until every person in USA can recite the verse. Same with "1 John 3:17" verse regarding Donald Trump and Elon Musk paired with the Trump Bible in hand. Why can no social media user on the entire world wide web make this a front-page hashtag / posting topic until every American over age 12 can recite and reference this verse? The clergy has failed. Just as it has failed in the Middle East to prevent terrorism and prevent war between Islam and other religions.

Bluesky is more of the same. A new technology format has the potential to really go viral / something that really catches on fast.

And people can not distinguish fiction from nonfiction, reality from anti-reality, information warfare from sincere education (Peter P) on the subject. Neil Postman has been brought up in the press enough times - people are actively flocking away, no teachers or media stars with platforms are staying sustained on this like it is the true risk that it is.

People Trust Donald Trump. How much more warning can you have than people believing Donald Trump? People believe Putin, trust Russia. Donald Trump trusts Putin! How much more warning of obvious anti-reality fiction faiths can we see? The Levant Torah, Bible, Quran has been festering problems in terms of fiction vs. nonfiction (metaphors all)...
