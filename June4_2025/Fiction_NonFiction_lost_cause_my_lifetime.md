Am I facing the realization / attitude change....

... That fiction vs. non-fiction is a lost cause.

"Operation Matthew 4:19" and everything Peter P wrote about in years 2012 / 2013 had no focus on media ecology.

Adding in domestic USA trends:

1. Apple iPhone changed everything by year 2011. Never going back to times when Internet 5G was rare, WiFi was still rare, etc.

2. Neil Postman was correct about Fox News in 1985. All HDTV news.

3. Rick Roderick was right in 1993 about technology. As was Neil Postman in 1992 about technology.

4. ChatGPT / generative visual. Neil Postman emphasis on visual medium...

5. Elon Musk leapfrogging everyone and taking over Twitter, which gets copied to every other media platform / news media site.

6. Carl Sagan was correct in 1995 about Twitter-length / text message length / screen size "sound bites". TikTok.


Again, everything Peter P was saying was WITHOUT generative AI / ChatGPT introduction in 2022. And without Elon Musk going into core media systems.

Video game culture too has grown. The shift away from ciema to home movie release. Video games played at home instead of arcades outside the home. Pandemic greatly shifted this.

Second Life coming back, Meta / Mark Z was correct - but over-invested too quickly.

# It will Trickle Down

I think a lot of "old life" books / reading will just die off. Dead-ends. People will settle into a more standard format, common format, a visual approach of CGI visual fantasy.

Even if they don't live it, people will consume rich people living it. Admire the superstars living it.
