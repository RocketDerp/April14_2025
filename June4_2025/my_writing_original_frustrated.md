I am frustrated with my writing. I don't want to write this, I want a modern day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr to write this. Someone who has excellent language talents and audience skills.

Malala isn't on Bluesky, she doesn't want to take the leap yet of equating Quran with ALL fiction (Mohamamd being a great storywriter, storyteller, of science fiction metaphors).

Anyway...

::: Social Media Users Across the World, especially in USA, did not stand up for Goodness :::

It doesn't matter if you are legally able to vote, this is a 24 hour a day 7 days a week 365 days a year thing. This is about goodness itself in every area of society. Any adult age 12 and beyond.

.

::: Bling Bling Admiration Culture :::

Common people criticize hoarding of wealth, but rarely do you witness people criticizing the admiration of bling bling / conspicuous consumption / symbolism of wealth.

People are outright attracted to the wealth of sports stars, musicians, religion leaders / organizations, etc.

"Bling Life", discussing the fashion and style and castles of the rich and famous. 

Artists are often the very people who are our clergy of self-awareness, of human subconscious self-awareness. The Beatles, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z.

These are our poetry writers. The modern storytellers of Torah, Quran, Bible. And corporations like Disney with Star Wars.

::: World Peace is "A Joke" to Common People :::

Everyday People have turned #WorldPeace into a joke topic, joke idea, amusement joke.

On one hand, #NeilPostmanWasRight1985 

On the other hand, when can we connect common psychological problems in our personal life scale to greater world war problems?

This was the divorce / branching of Sigmund Freud and Carl Sagan.

!!! "Why is psychology the youngest of the empirical sciences? Why have we not long since discovered the unconscious and raised up its treasure-house of eternal images? Simply because we had a religious formula for everything psychic — and one that is far more beautiful and comprehensive than immediate experience. Though the Christian view of the world has paled for many people, the symbolic treasure-rooms of the East are still full of marvels that can nourish for a long time to come the passion for show and new clothes. What is more, these images — be they Christian or Buddhist or what you will — are lovely, mysterious, richly intuitive." - The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (1934), Dr. Carl Jung !!! #CarlJung #FWakeY1934

We have known for over 90 years. Are we gong to face up that there is no supernatural? That our brain languages / our dreams in our mind, our poetry, our music lyrics, our art - our internal brain representation of life is incomplete? 

How can a child understand the distance and mechanics of the sun, stars, moon without building rockets and experiments? What is the likelihood of a 14 year old child grasping planetary motions and that there is no atmosphere on the moon or in space? How many common people, everyday people, at age 14 would grasp and understand this? Almost all such knowledge requires extensive time of thinking, experiments, learning and sharing fro other people. Networks of people sharing information. Our religions were often concerned with the sun and moon and built calender systems for religion holiday and rituals. And of course, farming and growing and preparing for difficult weather conditions had benefits to understanding he seasons on Earth.

::: Competition :::

Manipulation, deliberate deception on massive scale,warfare, keeping secrets to wish others to die or harm themselves without knowing something is poison / toxic / harmful. Either for profit motives or death-wishing another race, culture, religion, economic system, nation, gender, etc.

1. Why have we not open sourced globally all information than an ambulance / emergency services / firemen would need? "First aid", "first responders", - a "Super Wiki system for first responders / First Aid / FIre Drills / Disaster Drills / Evacuation Drills and Procedures / communications systems (911, etc)"? Can we not see the benefits to having every person on Earth / Pale Blue Dot / sharing this in an organized Wiki style free advertising-free system?

2. History of development of medicine, medical. We have to take into account copyright and patent duration, so history of absolutely free and open knowledge on these topics in "Super Wiki system for understanding medical progress" runs into intellectual property rights. But we can still try with all public domain - using history as a basis. Explain why certain ideas and medicines were used in certain time period and teach people how goodness is developed.
