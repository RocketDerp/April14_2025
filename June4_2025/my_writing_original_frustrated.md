I am frustrated with my writing. I don't want to write this, I want a modern day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr to write this. Someone who has excellent language talents and audience skills.

Malala isn't on Bluesky, she doesn't want to take the leap yet of equating Quran with ALL fiction (Mohamamd being a great storywriter, storyteller, of science fiction metaphors).

Anyway...

::: Social Media Users Across the World, especially in USA, did not stand up for Goodness :::

It doesn't matter if you are legally able to vote, this is a 24 hour a day 7 days a week 365 days a year thing. This is about goodness itself in every area of society. Any adult age 12 and beyond.

::: Bling Bling Admiration Culture :::

Common people criticize hoarding of wealth, but rarely do you witness people criticizing the admiration of bling bling / conspicuous consumption / symbolism of wealth.

People are outright attracted to the wealth of sports stars, musicians, religion leaders / organizations, etc.

"Bling Life", discussing the fashion and style and castles of the rich and famous. 

Artists are often the very people who are our clergy of self-awareness, of human subconscious self-awareness. The Beatles, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z.

These are our poetry writers. The modern storytellers of Torah, Quran, Bible. And corporations like Disney with Star Wars.
