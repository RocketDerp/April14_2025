# Banksy Was Right

Advertising and marketing are the established manipulating the unestablished. Similar to organized religions in the past.

# Comparative Mythology ++

1. Comparative Mythology
2. Edward Bernays, Public Relations
3. Marketing and Advertising
4. Peer to Peer comms via postal systems, public service
5. Funding without advertising
6. Not over-funding popular arts, spillover
7. Music Cartels are like Religion cartels, copyright vs. addiction
8. Copyright across every industry
9. Ways fair-use is already abused (people on YouTube use familiar clips for exaggeration, not to parody them, but to ride the coat-tail of their popularity or production values)

I'm not advocating for more restrictions. Much more about understanding and self-awareness.

Internet coin for tipping, fair use, and full accounting
Treating well and rewarding those who do any part of the labor

# Manipulators, Liars, Sneaks

Aggressive salespeople, creating many variations for profit, etc.

# Over-indexing is good

Ultimate Super Wiki systems
Ultimate Wiki Data

Every association, every idea, linked.
When I built social media systems computer teaching was still new, so we had novice / advanced mode.
Social media radio (ham radio) even had novice and advanced levels for channel access, read-only vs. publishing

Old reddit vs. new still survives for many years

Simple English Wikipedia integrated with Standard

1. Too person filtered out, like a bunch of detail about a cottage business that Wikipedia would normally not promote
2. TLDR / ELI4 / ELI8 / in a hurry filtering.

Ultimately all humanity needs to aggregate all information.

Yes, we may crash the economy.

# Post Capitalism vs. Communism wars

Yes, we may crash the economy. Is war worth it? Are the rich people worth it?

Can we have expensive NASA like projects without having too much power or wealth in the hands of very few?

World Wide Communism. Pale Blue Dot.

Carl Marx Communism did not account for technology advancement to this degree.

Star Trek Communism.

Are we willing to sacrifice for such a common good, future.

Is that NOT the metaphor of Heaven in Christanity and Islam? Can we be serious about Heaven in those faiths - that that was the future we promised out children like Star Trek fiction / science fiction?

NOTE: This was written very badly. I am having severe brain damage. Ukraine war for so many years and Israel Palestine conflict and others on my mind. USA going into the "It can't Happen Here" corpos / corporeate overload wars on my mind. Mass mind brain damage.

NOTE: I wrote this in public to show the struggle. I don't agree with it just because I'm trying to organize and get past certain stuck ideas / mass mind influence.
