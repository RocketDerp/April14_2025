# High Road Not Taken

Again, I do not see "High Roads" being taken at all.

Against MAGA.   
Against ICE.   
Against Truth Social.    
Against Fox News. Against Rupert Murdoch.   
Against Donald Trump (Trump Bible).  
Against JD Vance (Proud Visible Catholic, Pope).  


### Metaphors All

Regardless of believer or non-believer (there are three states: atheists are wrong, believers are wrong, metaphors explain why both are wrong). 

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

# The High Roads!!

Malala and MLK Jr's high roads are nost just non-violent sit-in protests. They *preach*, they criticize interpretaiton of Bible and Quran and Torah! They HEAL the literacy, comprehension, understanding problems. They PREACH!!

People are so concerend with folloiwng MLK Jr protests that they forget his writing themselves, his teachings, his *lessons* behind the protests. Much like the Great Seal USA is forgotten behind the Consitution. What does that pyramid mean on the dollar bill?

Understanding and comprehension is the MAGA Donald Trump / Russian Information Warfare crisis since March 2013!
