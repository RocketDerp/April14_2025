# High Road Not Taken

Wedneday, June 25, 2025   
Again, I do not see "High Roads" being taken at all.

Against MAGA.   
Against ICE.   
Against Truth Social.    
Against Fox News. Against Rupert Murdoch.   
Against Donald Trump (Trump Bible).  
Against JD Vance (Proud Visible Catholic, Pope).  


### Metaphors All

Regardless of believer or non-believer (there are three states: atheists are wrong, believers are wrong, metaphors explain why both are wrong). 

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

# The High Roads!!

Malala and MLK Jr's high roads are nost just non-violent sit-in protests. They *preach*, they criticize interpretaiton of Bible and Quran and Torah! They HEAL the literacy, comprehension, understanding problems. They PREACH!!

People are so concerend with folloiwng MLK Jr protests that they forget his writing themselves, his teachings, his *lessons* behind the protests. Much like the Great Seal USA is forgotten behind the Consitution. What does that pyramid mean on the dollar bill?

Understanding and comprehension is the MAGA Donald Trump / Russian Information Warfare crisis since March 2013!

&nbsp;

MAGA clames to be super Christian, the Trump Bible, the 10 commandments in school. Hove it up their ass, that's the high road.

## Love thy Enemy 

Love the immigrant enemy. Stop making such a show of how much you hate and distrust them, make a show of how much you want to love and take care of them and get them back peacefully home or integreated in USA society. Emphasize all the positive ideals of "Love Thy Enemy" in the Bible.  Repeating that CORRECT INTERPRETATION of The Bible *is the High Roads*. Constantly insutling, mocking ICE - is just adding more hate fuel to the MAGA hate bonfire that has been burning in Levant out-group patterns that were dragged over from the Middle East. Gentile / non-believer / infidel. 

## Marketing attracts

All this bragging about wealth and greatness of USA has made USA attractive. Go beyond reactionary responses like "victum blaming" and "being raped because of how you dressed" - the rality is that the USA is in the business of selling Hollywood lifestyle in our enteratinment exports to the rest of the world. We are braggards. Maybe we should re-think about that... the fall of huberous that Russia seems to have explotied in our own praising of egomania leadership!

Did we get to ride the exploitation of a continent that was technologically undeveloped in year 1720. And Did we ride peotroem and automobile lifestyle to a point of such extreme pride and "identity politics" with our cars, that we can't see that our lifestyle is not sustaintable for the rest of the world - and we are marketing / advertising it to children everywhere.  We have painted a picture of Heaven Itself to people.

People want to immigrate to the USA because it was better. To deny this appeal is to deny our own history of immigration from year 1720 onward.
