# High Road Not Taken

Wedneday, June 25, 2025   
Again, I do not see "High Roads" being taken at all.

Against MAGA.   
Against ICE.   
Against Truth Social.    
Against Fox News. Against Rupert Murdoch.   
Against Donald Trump (Trump Bible).  
Against JD Vance (Proud Visible Catholic, Pope).  


### Metaphors All

Regardless of believer or non-believer (there are three states: atheists are wrong, believers are wrong, metaphors explain why both are wrong). 

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

# The High Roads!!

Malala and MLK Jr's high roads are nost just non-violent sit-in protests. They *preach*, they criticize interpretaiton of Bible and Quran and Torah! They HEAL the literacy, comprehension, understanding problems. They PREACH!!

People are so concerend with folloiwng MLK Jr protests that they forget his writing themselves, his teachings, his *lessons* behind the protests. Much like the Great Seal USA is forgotten behind the Consitution. What does that pyramid mean on the dollar bill?

Understanding and comprehension is the MAGA Donald Trump / Russian Information Warfare crisis since March 2013!

&nbsp;

MAGA clames to be super Christian, the Trump Bible, the 10 commandments in school. Hove it up their ass, that's the high road.

## Love thy Enemy 

Love the immigrant enemy. Stop making such a show of how much you hate and distrust them, make a show of how much you want to love and take care of them and get them back peacefully home or integreated in USA society. Emphasize all the positive ideals of "Love Thy Enemy" in the Bible.  Repeating that CORRECT INTERPRETATION of The Bible *is the High Roads*. Constantly insutling, mocking ICE - is just adding more hate fuel to the MAGA hate bonfire that has been burning in Levant out-group patterns that were dragged over from the Middle East. Gentile / non-believer / infidel. 

## Marketing attracts

All this bragging about wealth and greatness of USA has made USA attractive. Go beyond reactionary responses like "victum blaming" and "being raped because of how you dressed" - the rality is that the USA is in the business of selling Hollywood lifestyle in our enteratinment exports to the rest of the world. We are braggards. Maybe we should re-think about that... the fall of huberous that Russia seems to have explotied in our own praising of egomania leadership!

Did we get to ride the exploitation of a continent that was technologically undeveloped in year 1720. And Did we ride peotroem and automobile lifestyle to a point of such extreme pride and "identity politics" with our cars, that we can't see that our lifestyle is not sustaintable for the rest of the world - and we are marketing / advertising it to children everywhere.  We have painted a picture of Heaven Itself to people.

People want to immigrate to the USA because it was better. To deny this appeal is to deny our own history of immigration from year 1720 onward.

### Back to Love Thy Enemy

We are BEYOND The Bible. And Carl Sagan's books should all be added to The Bible. He is a great humanist, even an American to boot. Like Thomas Jefferson (Founding Father) in year 1820, we can delete parts of The Bible we disagree with.

In Pale Blue Dot perspective, we have to actually elevate every person on Earth's life. That's also part of the Great Seal USA vision (and why a pyramid in Africa, "out of Africa" has deep metaphor meanings too).

How can we respect ourselves as human beings if there are people starving for $2 a day food when we are living a $170 a day USA lifestyle?

We have to try, and fail, just like trial and failure has been for all technology development. We have to try and learn from mistakes and progresss. Iteratively.

We must also convince people just because we help educate (Wiki open style) how to grow food, shelter, technology out - to not have 15 cchildren per family and self-regulate / help with the hate and other human conflict problems.

### Real Risk

We are sitting on a technology bomb. We **did not take OpenBSD** path, we went with Linux / Apple / Windows. We did not become serious about computer security like OpenBSD Canada project. There is no quick fix, we have decades of a mess.

Peace, love, compassion ae not options. And what the fuck is life when they are only secondary concerns? When we make war, hate, dehumanization our default behaivor. (James Joyce: History is a Nightmare to wake from).

### We Could have OpenBSD

We Could have. We could have elimminated a lot of faults, crashes, exploits, thefts - and BSD Unix / Berkely *hippies* had all the idealism. 1995 - but we went with Linux. Why - device drivers, hardware support - as much as anything. Microsoft ALWAYS had multi-hardware, Apple was closed hardware (their few attempts to open to other hardware makers all ended in dead-end paths).

We could have OpenBSD .. but we didn't.

We favored rapid growth and expansion over security
