# People "in" Politics

I am sure some part of my massive frustration with social media behaviors (deportation wishing on human persons, out-group hate) since year 2013 is because I did not discuss #Politics topics before, but Donald Trump and Putin sutured EVERY topic, including medical virus.

Now with RFKjr leading the way, autism is core politics every hour of every day, anti-humanism. It was not like that before year 2013. And people who write books and topics of "politics" seem very hate-oriented, hate motivated, out-group dehumanize. Teams of hate.
