# People "in" Politics

https://bsky.app/profile/roundsparrow.bsky.social/post/3ltrpkcbxis2c

I am sure some part of my massive frustration with social media behaviors (deportation wishing on human persons, out-group hate) since year 2013 is because I did not discuss **Politics topics** before, but Donald Trump and Putin saturated EVERY topic, including medical virus.

Now with RFKjr leading the way, autism is core politics every hour of every day, anti-humanism. It was not like that before year 2013. And people who write books and topics of "politics" seem very hate-oriented, hate motivated, out-group dehumanize. Teams of hate.

&nbsp;

### Faith in war

A lot of people who are political organizers, political writers, seem to have faith in warfare, military, war, nations in conflict. And when Malala published her book October 8, 2013 - they did not see something that all the world rallied around. Because they view things through what University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan called "the rear view mirror", where I have viewed things since age 13 through James Joyce's idea that "history is a nightmare" that the state of our religions and society are horrific and bad and we better start addressing the language / comprehension / understanding / Tower of Babel / religion clergy teaching and rituals!

### Repeat Malala, Repeat MLKjr

The next election, the next candidate, deporting happy, hate happy, thrilled with the "horse race" and "sports mentality" of voting. The idea of being able to deport political opponents, starve and take away health care. Seems to drive Democrats and Republicans both in USA since year 2013. They have WELCOMED the Putin Media Invasion of hate on ANY topic, the merging of EVERY topic into this "horse race" win win win elections into every social media encounter. 

The need to stay focused on not a team but the entire world, what Malala is addressing (and I do not mean just what she says about gender of girls and child education, she says much more than that on terrorism and reason thinking) - same with MLK Jr. People are unwilling to repeat MLK Jr's content on hate (The 1954 Equation) - and only want to make it about voting and skin color. The Putin Media Invasion and MAGA was all about hate, but people concerned with politics their whole lives seemed to *revel in* the increased hate and *competition* and there *was no high road* of saying: WE ALL need World Wide Peace, we ALL need to repeat Malala every day, we all need to make one day a week to discuss Malala and world peace / traditional religions being reformed.

People who seem to be on the topics of politics seem to have so much faith in groups and out-group hate (political party groups, corporate groups, lobby groups, author of politics groups)... so INGRAINED in the idea of misunderstanding and the personality of politicians (liars, deceivers, manipulators, TV game show hosts) and corporate lobby people (and the consumers of political-oriented media), the obsession with elections and not Tower of Babel world peace...

#### MLK jr stripped of hate teachings

MLK Jr has been stripped by people "into" politics as voter rights, black skin. Not the ***preventative*** preaching morality lessons of hate, dehumanization! You do not see people on social media in response to MAGA quoting MLK Jr on the topic of hate. MAGA is founded upon out-group hate, and so it seems the Democrats vs. Republicans is a out-group *hate hate hate hate-harder* faith fuled by Russian + Cambridge Analytica mind-fuck.

Martin Luther King Jr. emphasized *systems vs. humans*, and people "into" Politics (Democrats vs. Republicans, etc) are *into* competition systems. People believe in having an enemy to hate upon. And that's exactly the topics of Donald Trump and MAGA that Democrats and other Trump haters have avoided. That's the heart of my alarm, concern, crisis - is that people don't want to grasp what Peter Pomerantsev is saying about Putin / Russia methods - because people adore and flock to the hate aspect of competitive politics. Even Peter Pomerantsev himself seems avoidant of Neil Postman, Marshall McLuhan, Joseph Campbell and James Joyce's relevance to fiction vs. nonfiction - religion vs. nonfiction - which is at the very heard of "War Against Reality" (title of Peter Pomerantsev's 2019 book). 

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr felt it was critical that ALL hate in all places (The 1954 Equation) be phased out, left behind in history before we can have peaceful competittion and progress. And I witness many people into sports competittion, **political party competition**, brand vs. brand cometitition, nation vs. nation comptetition and "trade wars" and such - revel in the out-group hate that Malala and MLK Jr both address. People repulsed by the very ideas of not having out-group hate and warfare, who are addicted / attracted to the hate competitions and advancedment of hate technology and weapon systems technology on a large scale.

&nbsp;

##### Same with Malala

Malala has so many excellent words and ideas to share related to women's rights on abortion, transgender - but people on social media (Bluesky, Reddit, Mastodon) grey-rocked her since her Octobe 8, 2013 book - more than a FULL DECADE of avoiding repeating her in the face of MAGA / USA deport-happy block-happy. It seems like people "into" video game competition and sports competititon and politics compettition do not want to address ending competitition of hate vs. hate, out-group hate. It sure seems that way.

&nbsp;

##### Trolling Works, Operation Matthew 4:19

USA people with faith in competiition at any cost, the thrill of defeating other human persons, eat it up.

July 12, 2025 headline

In July 2025, people are thrilled to have a chance to be violent and hate-filled at ICE. People are not cheering on peaceful intelligence protesters teaching morality lessons of American Dr. Martin Luther King Jr on the problem of hate (including hate of blocking on social media, hate via deporting people you disagree with instead of assisting immigrants in good ways). Competitive oriented people live and die for competitition, not for MLK Jr's morality reform of year 1954.

&nbsp;

##### Less about name-fame

People "into" poltiics seem extremely concerned with the names of people and groups. Not in the thinking system, not in the moral values, not in progress towards goodness - but winning a competititon and any price. And that is why repeating MLK Jr's / Malala's ideas on *hate is bad* is not done in the face of Donald Trump supporters / MAGA / Putin media invasion / Russian information warfare. People are attracted to the hate, not to meeting strangers and non-famous (no name-fame) all over the world. My living in North Africa, Middle East, South America I enjoyed *nature and everyday people* at crossings, I was not seeking out "holy lands spots", and name-fame like people "into" politics seem to crave and want to die for.
