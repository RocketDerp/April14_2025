# People "in" Politics

https://bsky.app/profile/roundsparrow.bsky.social/post/3ltrpkcbxis2c

I am sure some part of my massive frustration with social media behaviors (deportation wishing on human persons, out-group hate) since year 2013 is because I did not discuss **Politics topics** before, but Donald Trump and Putin sutured EVERY topic, including medical virus.

Now with RFKjr leading the way, autism is core politics every hour of every day, anti-humanism. It was not like that before year 2013. And people who write books and topics of "politics" seem very hate-oriented, hate motivated, out-group dehumanize. Teams of hate.

### Faith in war

A lot of people who are politicial organizers, political writers, seem to have faith in warfare, military, war, nations in conflict. And when Malala published her book October 8, 2013 - they did not see something that all the world rallied around. Because they view things through what University of Toronto's Marshall McLuhan called "the rear view mirror", where I have viewed things since age 13 through James Joyce's idea that "history is a nightmare" that the state of our religions and society are horrific and bad and we better start addresssing the language / comprehension / understanding / Tower of Babel / religion clergy teaching and rituals!

### Repeat Malala, Repeat MLKjr

People who seem to be on the topics of politics seem to have so much faith in groups and out-group hate (poltiical party groups, corporate groups, lobby groups, author of politics groups)... so INGRANED in the idea of misunderstanding and the personality of politicians (liars, deceivers, manipulators, TV game show hosts) and corporte lobby people (and the consumers of political-oriented media), the obssession with elections and not Tower of Babel world peace...
