People mock and insult "The Democrats" / Democrats political party that it is time to stop the high road.

# High Road was never taken

High Road would have been to address the anti-reality of Rupert Murdoch media networks directly. To address QAnon directly and sustained

## Roads are sustained

Sustained paths are roads. Not just an article here or there, a mention in a speech here or there, a single social media posting here or there, but week after week after week of sustained repeating and assertion that *this is more important than sports scores / rumors about actors and upcoming films, and time to be serious.*

Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" and burning one's personal reputation and political power to say: we have a crisis of Fox News that was described in a book 11 years before Fox News went on the air and we need to be serious and sustained on this topic. We in year 2015 are living in the outcome of this problem, MAGA and Donald Trump popularity are symptoms of this problem.

## Hearts and Minds war

The high road is to make the case for compassion and goodness. To be willing to die for faith in love and compassion for all people. Being willing to murder, kill, wage war, terrorism - is not going to cultivate faiths in goodness and expanded compassion.
