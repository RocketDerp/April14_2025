# Social Media Users

Social media users / social media society / social media community did not stand up.

Those with the free time and spare time to talk about films, sports, elections, entertainment, politics, kittens, television shows, video games - all the constant content of social media - did not stand up and take 20 seconds or 90 seconds of their day and stand up persistently, repeating, and annoyingly *be serious* every 12 hours and every 24 hours. Sustained assertion of goodness.
