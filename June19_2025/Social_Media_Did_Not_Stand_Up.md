# Social Media Users

Social media users / social media society / social media community did not stand up.

Those with the free time and spare time to talk about films, sports, elections, entertainment, politics, kittens, television shows, video games - all the constant content of social media - did not stand up and take 20 seconds or 90 seconds of their day and stand up persistently, repeating, and annoyingly *be serious* every 12 hours and every 24 hours. Sustained assertion of goodness.

### Not Good Enough: Malala

1. "Not Good Enough Malala social media society behavior since October 2013, past dozen years" - USA social media users glad to support women suffering and terrorism and won't lift a finger to promote Malala constantly. Why is Malala not good enough for people to repeat?

# The Audience

&nbsp;

## The Bible Audience USA 

&nbsp;

## The Quran Audience Swat Valley

&nbsp;

## The "media" Audience

These news networks thrive because they have ratings. Joe Rogan is the media. he makes huge money. Rupert Murdoch, MSNBC, CNN all make money selling shit. The audience is the problem.

&nbsp;

## Neil Postman 1985

So why don't social media audiences assert Neil Postman? Because people only care about egomania and do not want to irritate or bother the ego of others. By prizing egomania you create a society that values Donald Trump and Elon Musk role models of egomania. By NOT being preachy and community-righteous world-righteous (self-righteous is egomania, global righteous is goodness itself). As it has been, it has been Truckle Down Influence from Billionares / billiouare-righteous.

There is no excuse, there is no good reason, to not quote Neil Postmanâ€™s 1985 book over and over since March 2013 rise of MAGA / Donald Trump / Elon Musk / Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook, Instagram, Meta), Fox News / Newsmax / Rush Limbaugh / Alex Jones / Joe Rogan / Tucker Carlson / Twitter shit. There **is no excuse, no reason, other than egoism and self-centered choices**. The faith that being "too preachy" is the worst thing in the world. No, the worst thing in the world is Putin's Ukraine war against Russia, how Israel hates and how Palestine terrorism (again: Malala ignored by We The People Social Media for a decade before October 7)

### Social media is We People

**We The People** is social media. You can't keep blaming *"the media'* when every person is sharing kitten photos and anime and sports scores since year 2013 - it only takes 20 seconds or 90 seconds to REPEAT DAILY the exact same quote from Malala. To deal with the mind-virus of billionaires head-on by doing what paid advertising does - REPEAT. Have you not noticed advertising is repetitive? And you aren't selling a book, you are selling an idea, a quote. This isn't about money, this is about egomania and self-centered values. Malala is not self-centered!

Neil Postman is not self centered. Carl Sagan is not self centered. Repeating and quoting books - you can publish the entire book one line at a time every 4 hours on social media. But it is not attractive, that's the egoism problem, that is why Donald Trump **IS ATTRACTIVE AND CHARMING** that is why Elon Musk is attractive. We have to face up to the egomania in democracy, that absence of compassion and love in democracy, does not work! People are in deep love with Donald Trump, face up to reality!

&nbsp;

### War Against Reality

Why oh why do social media users complain about MAGA since March 2013 believing falsehoods and not repeat every 12 hours the name of Peter P?

# It Can Happen

**We The People of the World is Social Media, The World Wide Web**.

"The trouble isn't so much that we don't know enough, but it's as if we aren't good enough. The trouble isn't so much that our scientific genius lags behind, but our moral genius lags behind. The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live. So we find ourselves caught in a messed-up world." - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr
