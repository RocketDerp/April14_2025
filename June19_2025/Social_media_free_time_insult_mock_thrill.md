Those with the free time on social media, those with the spare time on social media USA are so addicted to the stimulation of mocking / insulting / name-calling MAGA / Trump supporters / GOP - that they do not want to rescue and end the simualcras.

There is no censorship or arrests for standing up on social media and repeating:

1. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death"
2. Peter Pomerantsev, "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia" book fronm 2014
3. Peter Pomerantsev's articles
4. What happened to QAnon messages? Are we in USA going to behave like QAnon wasn't all around during January 6, 2021 and act like it is only Fox News and Newsmax and Truth Social? QAnon was nothing but Internet messages, this is pure information warfare that people swallow. Neil Postman 1985 realized.

Instead, those who hate Donald Trump and hate Elon Musk spend all free time and spare tine in out-group hate insulting and mocking. It is a non-stop source of comedy jokes, entertainment.

## This is the USA

1. MAGA insults liberals and "liberal tears"
2. Trump haters insult MAGA / conservatives over and over
3. Every person in USA insulting USA people
4. Nobody asking for ALL people to stop the screen game of non-stop hate and insult, that we are in a feedback loop, and have been for over a decade since June 2015.

## Death of future / children

People go on and on about election day every 4 years, and how 30% voted for MAGA - and that no way a non-voters could possibly be addicted to the mocking of humanism, constant decline of intelligence and goodness in favor of non-stop insulting and mocking.

## Iran isn't enough

June 19, 2025 as I write this, people talk about Iran being a broken and bad nation with bad leaders. What exactly to USA people think it is like living under a fiction Quran and Mohammad stories from year 640 is like? When a government of people supressed women and then everyone in the socity plays along with the fiction Quran storyelling of Mohamamd.  That is now what the USA is doing in year 2025, people are so engaged in living under the fiction storytelling and insulting the Jewish / Israel - and chanting "Death to America" (that being the MAGA like group) - and then insulting the Muslims / Islamic faith by the other groups in the society. It's a total network of out-group hate. It is group of humans hating on other gorups of humans and never able to actually adopt a society based on authentic science reality and compassion for all pepole, because people are perpetually *reacting* to the gorups they hate. It is a hate-based insult and mocking society dragging down everyone over fiction news (Quran prayers / clergy lessons) and bullshit.

Iran isn't enough for Americans to "wake up" to what is going on in USA. Every person in their own media consumption channels mocking and insulting the *other people* in thier media consumption channels. Bullshit media vs. Bullshit media, every flavor of insult and mocking possible. Commercialized and profitable media of insult the other Americans. Feedback loop upon feeback loop, sports team upon sports team, all having in common insulting / name-calling stimulation.
