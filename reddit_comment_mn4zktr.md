*"At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance’s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare". It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn’t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare.* ***It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations*** *that then translate into political action."* - ["Russia and the Menace of Unreality", "How Vladimir Putin is revolutionizing information warfare".
