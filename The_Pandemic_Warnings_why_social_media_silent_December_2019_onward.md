The Pandemic warnings

Why can't a billionaire actually say something correct, true, factual, sincere, earnest, and good? Why can't a billionaire actually be authentic and honest?

Why can't social media consumers recognize fact from fiction? Why can't social media users say: that fact is correct.  Just because billionaires Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump and Elon Musk constantly deceive and manipulate about medical science, why do people have to jump to the simple binary conclusion that *all billionaires are always wrong*.

Why oh why can social media users since December 2019, in year 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 *not say* / not communicate the most simple factual statement about the situation? Why let RFK Jr and Donald Trump billionaires spokesmen speak for anti-science and anti-goodness and not point to science information being used as a warning to *be prepared*?

## Pandemic Warnings August 24, 2018

On the topic of social media society being silent about pandemic warnings:

This is 15 months before a virus escaped via airports in Wuhan, China to airports all over the world. How come conspiracy theorists don't discuss *actual validated evidence and facts* from Johns Hopkins University and George Washington University?

There is something wrong with the media ecology behaviors of social media consumers. Neil Postman was correct in his 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death"...

Measles outbreaks are going on in North America all year 2025, and social media users are ignoring that measles is in that August 24, 2018 BBC story. Our society-wide avoidance of nonfiction problem is extremely serious.
