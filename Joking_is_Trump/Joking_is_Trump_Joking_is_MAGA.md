**PC, Politically Correct**    

This isn't about "Political Correctness", it is about self-awareness.  
Nobody is winning.  
There are no winners in this.  
Even those who believe they are in command and control of meme jokes find themselves overrun and compulsively serving the joke-making and delivery.   
The situation is comparable to not recognizing drunk driving, drunk driving, drunk governing, drunk leadership, driving people crazy with humor. Mob mentality has no winners.  
Viral media, viral joking, is core to David Foster Wallace's focus   
The viral media is Trump brand.   
The viral message is Trump power.   
This is no joking matter, our minds are being exploited, again.   

* "I'm getting put down! I'm getting pushed round! I'm being beaten every day! My life's fading..."
* "You've been screwed again! If you let them do it to you… you've got yourself to blame! It's you who feels the pain. It's you that feels ashamed."
* "the pigs"
