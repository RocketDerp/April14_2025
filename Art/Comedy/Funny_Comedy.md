Food jokes, funhy comedy. We all eat food. Although we do need to deal with the starving in the world and I beg people to give that topic more attention (Bible vese "1 John 3:17" should be know by every person over age 12 in USA and discussed in context of Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, Elon Musk D.O.G.E. White House, etc)
