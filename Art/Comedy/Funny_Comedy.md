Food jokes, funhy comedy. We all eat food. Although we do need to deal with the starving in the world and I beg people to give that topic more attention (Bible vese "1 John 3:17" should be know by every person over age 12 in USA and discussed in context of Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, Elon Musk D.O.G.E. White House, etc)

I like this lesson because it is an egoism lesson about Suchi and how people behave towards people and foods they don't like. The out-group Tower of Babel conflicts over langauge / conventions / taste / aquired taste / ignorance vs. understanding (Ohio is not a great source for ocean seafood experts, the airport joke).

This is humor that teache goodness and self-awareness of a page 59 menu and egoism of going out to eat.
