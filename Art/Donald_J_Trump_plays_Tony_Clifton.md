# Donald Trump Death

Asked about longstanding rumors that the comedian didn't actually die in 1984, his best friend, writer Bob Zmuda, says, "So this is where I have to watch what I say, guard myself here."

"Because, did Andy Kaufman fake his death or not? One thing I do know, had Andy Kaufman not died, what would he be doing? He’d be faking his own death," he says.

A conversation between Zmuda and Kaufman about the subject is played in the documentary. Zmuda says the root of the idea was obvious.

"Think of that. Faking his death... Where did Andy get that premise from? His parents!" he says.

"They faked Papu’s death," he continues, referring to Kaufman's beloved grandfather. When Papu died, Kaufman's parents told their son he was away on a trip. Kaufman didn't discover the truth until he was older. "They faked it and said he didn’t die," Zmuda adds. "The lie, the cherished lie, can change reality. Reality can always be maneuvered and controlled. This is very important."
