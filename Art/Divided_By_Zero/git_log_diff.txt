+		<li>Campbell; 1974 Audio: &quot;Now the problem that all of the great masters give us is that of finding the inward way and holding to the outer way. This is a formula that the old Sufis worked out in the following way: they spoke of wearing the outer garment of the law—that is to say, the order of society in which one is living—and wearing the inner garment of the mythic way.
+
+			Now in order to find the inner garment you have to take off the outer garment and let it go. There is a long season very often of inward turning this way, and throwing the world away.
+
+			But unless you can put the other garment back on again, you haven’t really come to the sophistication that lets you know that this is that, and that is this—that this outer garment is the outer reflection of the same laws and principles that you’re finding within, so that you should be at ease somehow in the two worlds. This is an old mythological story.

-		<li>Campbell; 1974 Audio: &quot;Now the problem that all of the great masters give us is that of finding the inward way and holding to the outer way. This is a formula that the old Sufis worked out in the following way: they spoke of wearing the outer garment of the law—that is to say, the order of society in which one is living—and wearing the inner garment of the mythic way.

 			Now in order to find the inner garment you have to take off the outer garment and let it go. There is a long season very often of inward turning this way, and throwing the world away.

 		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now, eternity is beyond all categories of thought. This is an important point in all of the great Oriental religions. We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can't be told because they transcend thought.

In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, a great Sufi mystic said, "I and my beloved are one," and he, too, was crucified. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, "O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works."

Even Michael Jackson, as criticized by Tom Waits. The Regean "War on Drugs" was a modern day Prohibition against Hippies.  I never even used these drugs, but I see the murder and violence this created by declaring "War" on people's learning of their own minds through often peaceful drugs, art, music, etc.  That Detroit and New Orleans, America's music roots of Jazz and Motown - are in such ruins in year 2015 shows the war is right at home.

One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, "I and the Father are one." He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, a great Sufi mystic said, "I and my beloved are one," and he, too, was crucified. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, "O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works."

+Within weeks of that Bali New Years Eve, I was describing to my marriage partner - drawing on the glass wall of a shower that divided us - by drawing waves - that my own body hormones impacted my mental behavior. That I felt religion and biology - the prayer movemenets of Islam and even the calendar of Ramadan were interlinked to the black holes that spin our Star Solaris and our Moon.  I was using metaphors without full realization of how deep these connections really are inside our human brain.  My subconsious computer was crunching away at my education trying to make sense of a Socratic Logic when the world is not binary nor Socratic.

+Crackpot Brainstorming: Myth is Biologically Grounded – and way off
+
+“You've got the same body, with the same organs and energies, that Cro-Magnon man had thirty thousand years ago. Living a human life in New York City or living a human life in the caves, you go through the same stages of childhood, coming to sexual maturity, transformation of the dependency of childhood into the responsibility of manhood or womanhood, marriage, then failure of the body, gradual loss of its powers, and death. You have the same body, the same bodily experiences, and so you respond to the same images.”
+
+"These ideas Jung spoke of as archetypes of the unconscious. "Archetype" is the better term because "elementary idea" suggests headwork. Archetype of the unconscious means it comes from below. The difference between the Jungian archetypes of the unconscious and Freud's complexes is that the archetypes of the unconscious are manifestations of the organs of the body and their powers. Archetypes are biologically grounded, whereas the Freudian unconscious is a collection of repressed traumatic experiences from the individual's lifetime. 
+The Freudian unconscious is a personal unconscious, it is biographical. The Jungian archetypes of the unconscious are biological. The biographical is secondary to that."
+
+     MOYERS: You really believe there is a geography of the psyche? 
+     CAMPBELL: This is metaphorical language, but you can say that some people are living on the level of the sex organs, and that's all they're living for. That's the meaning of life. This is Freud's philosophy, is it not? Then you come to the Adlerian philosophy of the will to power, that all of life is centered on obstructions and overcoming the obstructions. Well, sure, that's a perfectly good life, and those are forms of divinity also. But they are on the animal level. Then there comes another kind of life, which involves giving oneself to others one way or another. This is the one that's symbolized in the opening of the heart. 
+     MOYERS: What is the source of that life? 
+     CAMPBELL: It must be a recognition of your life in the other, of the one life in the two of us. God is an image for that one life. We ask ourselves where this one life comes from, and people who think everything has to have been made by somebody will think, "Well, God made it." So God's the source of all this. 
+     MOYERS: Well then, what is religion? ' 
+     CAMPBELL: The word "religion" means religio, linking back. If we say it is the one life in both of us, then my separate life has been linked to the one life, religio, linked back. This has become symbolized in the images of religion, which represent that connecting link. 
+
+
+Problems from biological denial, igorance, of modern times:
+
+- Conflicting weekends between all 3 Levant religions (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) – and conflicting New Years – creates internal angst and anti-nature urges.
+- Separation of grandparents from grandchild – retirement communities and child care – two parent working lifestyles – and it's impact of sexless marriages and divorce / unhappiness with long-term relationships. Depriving the joyful fun of “growing together” year after year
+- Putting money-focused education above biological development. People go to school, avoid pregnancy and long-term relationships – favoring income, career ladder climbing, and financial secuirty then start seeking relationships at age 25 or even later.  Resulting in widespread misery by middile ages.
+- modernn housing with square walls, unnatural light, regulated tempatures, avoidance of the sounds of rainfall, temperature changes, etc.  We become soft, mechanized, and reactive, touchy, defensive.  We would murder over land and house – instead of learning to love and welcome strangers – because we have inverted our Myth and it's biological grounds.
+
+All because of a failed learning from our past Myth teachings – the shedding and discarding of anchient knowledge
+
+
+Campbell:
+
+“The people respond to the environment, you see. But now we have a tradition that doesn't respond to the environment -- it comes from somewhere else, from the first millennium B.C. It has not assimilated the qualities of our modern culture and the new things that are possible and the new vision of the universe. Myth must be kept alive.”
+
+“Now, when these were dropped, a whole tradition of Occidental mythological information was lost. It used to be that these stories were in the minds of people. When the story is in your mind, then you see its relevance to something happening in your own life. It gives you perspective on what's happening to you. With the loss of that, we've really lost something because we don't have a comparable literature to take its place. These bits of information from ancient times, which have to do with the themes that have supported human life, built civilizations, and informed religions over the millennia, have to do with deep inner problems, inner mysteries, inner thresholds of passage, and if you don't know what the guide-signs are along the way, you have to work it out yourself.“
+
+“There are two completely different stages of marriage. First is the youthful marriage following the wonderful impulse that nature has given us in the interplay of the sexes biologically in order to produce children. But there comes a time when the child graduates from the family and the couple is left. I've been amazed at the number of my friends who in their forties or fifties go apart. They have had a perfectly decent life together with the child, but they interpreted their union in terms of their relationship through the child. They did not interpret it in terms of their own personal relationship to each other.“

 As I sat there, with the ocean waves lapping against my heart - something stirred deeper and deeper inside me.  I had lived next to the ocean for 12 months in Arica, Chile - and watched the waves from my beautiful hilltop appartment - and the kind and loving families who had welcomed my now ex-wife and I into that society.  But here on New Years Eve in Bali - something really was going on inside me.  Here I was... having the same marriage conflicts in a second marriage, my partner unable to communicate deeply with me nor understand me.
 And I started to sense that more New Years were coming, that I had seen a calendar suggesting China had one, and I was already a Sufi Muslim - and knew that that was a third New Years.  And the ocean tides, moved by the Orbiting Satellite like clockwork - and even the joyful rainfalls every afternoon in Summer New Year of Bali.  I was far from my December Winter of midwestern North America youth that Bob Seger sings of in <em>Roll Me Away</em>.

 Paul Simon's song <em>50 ways to leave your lover</em> - was perhaps recalled to me (having experienced it at the shores of the Gulf of Mexico on at the NOLA Jazz Festival), the beauty of this song - I now call a Siloutee of Love (in many art forms) - how easy it is to destroy in the universe, but not how hard it is to create.  How e=mc^2 is a lopsided equation.  Dark Matter - 50 ways to leave your universe - and how many ways to Big Bang it?  This is how The Little Prince works, the abscence, the lonliness, the isolation, the missing community - it speaks to All.  Here I was, in Bali - with rocket launches by Everyone.

+	<p>The quotes are essential to me. As in my lifetime, I feel deeply that we have ignored the best of human experience - discarding it due to outer wrapping. Further, we have mostly accepted the worst of new learning techniques, only due to the fast immediate payoff (Edward Bernays teachings). The quotes are important to shared context, as it must be seen how little attention has been given to these public broadcasts that have collected dust - and how they interconnect. Most of all, I am always in a state of sadness, seeing the symbol of the Founding Fathers Eye of Reason in tears, as our Symbolic Eagle was created pointing at the Olive Branch. During my life, we have had homeloand peacetime - but we have ignored these deeper educators - wasting our peace in building for the next wartime.  When do we really choose to confront our society ego issues and listen to our Troubadour artists?  The songs and other art do not provide escape for me, they provide reminders of the Olive Branch that we seem to have forgotten.</p>

-		<li>Campbell; 1974 Audio: <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now the problem that all of the great masters give us is that of finding the inward way and holding to the outer way. This is a formula that the old Sufis worked out in the following way: they spoke of wearing the outer garment of the law—that is to say, the order of society in which one is living—and wearing the inner garment of the mythic way.

This is a formula that the old Sufis worked out in the following way: <span class="quoteH0">they spoke of wearing the outer garment of the law—that is to say, the order of society in which one is living—and wearing the inner garment of the mythic way</span>.
 			Now in order to find the inner garment you have to take off the outer garment and let it go. There is a long season very often of inward turning this way, and throwing the world away.
 			But unless you can put the other garment back on again, you haven’t really come to the sophistication that lets you know that this is that, and that is this—that this outer garment is the outer reflection of the same laws and principles that you’re finding within, so that you should be at ease somehow in the two worlds. This is an old mythological story.&quot;</span>

One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, "I and the Father are one." He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, a great Sufi mystic said, "I and my beloved are one," and he, too, was crucified. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, "O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works." Another of the Sufi mystics said, "The function of the orthodox [strict] community is to give the mystic his desire, which is a union with God, through mortification and death."&quot;</span>

+			Timothy Leary; Changing My Mind, Among Others : Lifetime Writings (1982), p. 76; To describe externals, you become a scientist. To describe experience, you become an artist. The old distinction between artists and scientists must vanish. Every time we teach a child correct usage of an external symbol, we must spend as much time teaching him how to fission and reassemble external grammar to communicate the internal. The training of artists and creative performers can be a straightforward, almost mechanical process. When you teach someone how to perform creatively (ie, associate dead symbols in new combinations), you expand his potential for experiencing more widely and richly.
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; Interview by David Sheff in Rolling Stone Twentieth Anniversary Issue (1987); "We are dealing with the best-educated generation in history. They are a hundred times better educated than their grandparents, and ten times more sophisticated. There has never been such an open-minded group. The problem is that no one is giving them anything fresh. They've got a brain dressed up with nowhere to go."
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; How to Operate Your Brain (1994); <span class="quoteA">&quot;Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities — the political, the religious, the educational authorities — who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing — forming in our minds — their view of reality. To <span class="quoteH0">think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable open-mindedness, chaotic, confused vulnerability to inform yourself</span>.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; The Psychedelic Experience (1964), p. 12; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of death, during an intermediate phase lasting forty-nine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their mystical teachings. … The esoteric meaning, as it has been interpreted in this manual, <span class="quoteH0">is that it is death and rebirth of the ego that is described</span>, not of the body. Lama Govinda indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The book's esoteric <span class="quoteH0">meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism</span>. It was not intended for general reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the pre-mortem-death-rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; The Psychedelic Experience (1964), ??; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Actions which are conscious expressions of the turn-on, tune-in, drop-out rhythm are religious.
+The wise person devotes his life exclusively to the religious search — for therein is found the only ecstasy, the only meaning.
+Anything else is a competitive quarrel over (or Hollywood-love sharing of) studio props.
+&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; The Psychedelic Experience (1964), ??; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Admit it. You aren’t like them. You’re not even close. You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal people” as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like “Have a nice day” and “Weather’s awful today, eh?”, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like “Tell me something that makes you cry” or “What do you think deja vu is for?”. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts. Do the unexpected. Find the others…&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; Chaos & Cyber Culture, 1994; <span class="quoteA">&quot;In the information-communication civilization of the 21st Century, creativity and mental excellence will become the ethical norm. The world will be too dynamic, complex, and diversified, too cross-linked by the global immediacies of modern (quantum) communication, for stability of thought or dependability of behaviour to be successful.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+
+		<li>
+			Timothy Leary; Chaos & Cyber Culture, 1994 (hand typed, needs proofing); <span class="quoteA">&quot;We tri-brain creatures seem to be resolving that most ancient philosophic problem. Forget the quaint, mammalian dualism of mind versus body.
+The interplay of life now invovles digital brain - body matter - digital screen.
+Everything - animal, vegetable, mineral, tangible, invisible, electric - is converted to digital food for the info-starved brain.
+And now, using the new digital appliances, everything that the brain-mind can conceive can be realized in electronic patterns.
+
+To be registered in consiousness, to be "realized," every sensory stimulation
+must be deconstructed, minimalized, digital-ized. <span class="quoteH0">The brain converts every pressure
+signal from our skins, tickles from our genitals, delectables from our tongues, photos
+from our eyes, sound waves from our ears, and best of all, electronic buzziness from our
+screens into quantum realities, into directories and files of 0/1 signals</span>.
+
+We tri-brain amphibians are learning how to use cyberwear (computer suits) <span class="quoteH0">to navigate around our
+ScreenLands the way we use the hardware of our bodies to navigate around the material-mechcanical world</span>, and the way

And what a wonderful world of myth one finds in celebration of the universal mystery!  The Greeks, it will be recalled, regarded Eros, the god of love, as the eldest of the gods; but also the youngest, born fresh and dewy-eyed in every loving heart.  There were, moreover, two orders of love, according to the manners of manifestation of this divinity, in his terrestrial aspect and celestial.  And Dante, following the classical lead, saw love suffusing and turning the universe, from the highest seat of the Trinity above to the lowest pits of Hell.</p>
+
+<p>One of the most amazing images of love that I know is Persian — a mystical Persian representation of Satan as the most loyal lover of God.  You will have heard the old legend of how, when God created the angels, he commanded them to pay worship to no one but himself; but then, creating man, he commanded them to bow in reverence to this most noble of his works, and Lucifer refused — because, we are told, of his pride.  However, according to this Moslem reading of his case, it was rather because he loved and adored God so deeply and intensely that he could not bring himself to bow before anything else.  And it was for that that he was flung into Hell, condemned to exist there forever, apart from his love.</p>
+
+<p>Now it has been said that of all the pains of Hell, the worst is neither fire nor stench but the deprivation forever of the beatific sight of God.  How infinitely painful, then, must the exile of this great lover be, who could not bring himself, even on God's own word, to bow before any other beings!</p>
+
+<p>The Persian poets have asked, "By what power is Satan sustained?" And the answer that they have found is this: "By his memory of the sound of God's voice when he said, 'Be gone!'" What an image of that exquisite spiritual agony which is at once the rapture and the anguish of love!</p>
+
+<p><img align="left" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/Hallaj.jpg" width="157" height="339" border="0" alt="Death of Hallaj">Another lesson from Persia is in the life and words of the great Sufi mystic <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/127150/heresy_and_orthodoxy_in_the_case_of.html?page=6" target="new" class="bodylink">Hallaj</a>, who in the year 922 was tortured and crucified for having declared that he and his Beloved —namely God—were one.  He had compared his love for God with that of the moth for the flame.  The moth plays about the lighted lamp till dawn, and returning with battered wings to its friends, tells of the beautiful thing it found; then, desiring to be joined to it entirely, flying into the flame the next night, becomes one with it.</p>
+
+<p>Such metaphors speak of a rapture that we all, one way or another, must at one time or another, either intensely or not so intensely, have experienced or at least imagined.  But there is another aspect of love, which some may also have experienced, and which is likewise illustrated in a Persian text.  This one is from an ancient Zoroastrian legend of the first parents of the human race, where they are pictured as having sprung from the earth in the form of a single reed, so closely joined that they could not have been told apart.  However, in time they separated; and again in time they united and there were born to them two children, whom they loved so tenderly and irresistibly that they ate them up.  The mother ate one; the father ate the other; and God, to protect the human race, then reduced the force of man's capacity for love by some ninety-nine per cent.  Those first parents thereafter had seven more pairs of children, every one of which, however—thank God!—survived.</p>
+
+<p>The old Greek idea of Love as the eldest of the gods is matched in India by that ancient myth from the <i>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</i> cited above of the Primal Being as a nameless, formless power that at first had no knowledge of itself but then thought, "I," <i>aham</i>, and immediately felt fear that the "me" it now had in mind might be slain. Then, reasoning, "Since I am all there is, what should I fear?" it thought, "I wish there were another!" and, swelling, splitting, became two, a male and a female; out of which primal couple there came into being all the creatures of this earth.  And when all had been accomplished, the male looked about, saw the world he had produced, and thought and said, "All this am I!"</p>
+
+<p>In the meaning of this story, that Primal Being antecedent to consciousness—which in the beginning thought, "I!" and felt fear, then desire—is the motivating substance activating each one of us in our unconsciously motivated lives.  And the second lesson of the myth is that through our won experiences of the union of love we participate in the creative action of that ground of all being.  For, according to the Indian view, our separateness form each other in space and time here on earth—our multitude—is but a secondary, deluding aspect of the truth, which is that in essence we are of one being, one ground; and we know and experience that truth—going out of ourselves, outside the limits of ourselves—in the rapture of love.</p>
+
+<p>The great German philosopher Schopenhauer, in a magnificent essay on "The Foundation of Morality," treats of this transcendental spiritual experience.  How is it, he asks, that an individual can so forget himself and his own safety that he will put himself and his life in jeopardy to save another from death or pain — as though that other's life were his own, that other's danger his own?  Such a one is then acting, Schopenhauer answers, out of an instinctive recognition of the truth that he and that other in fact are one.  He has been moved not from the lesser, secondary knowledge of himself as separate from others, but from an immediate experience of the greater, truer truth, that we are all one in the ground of our being.  Schopenhauer's name for this motivation is "compassion," <i>Mitleid</i>, and he identifies it as the one and only inspiration of inherently moral action.  It is founded, in his view, in a metaphysically valid insight.  For a moment one is selfless, boundless, without ego.  <img align="right" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/vietnam_helicopter_rescue.jpg" width="300" height="200" border="0" alt="Viet Nam helicopter rescue">And I have lately had occasion to think frequently of this word of Schopenhauer as I have watched on television newscasts of those heroic helicopter rescues, under fire in Vietnam, of young men wounded in enemy territory: their fellows, forgetful of their own safety, putting their young lives in peril as though the lives to be rescued were their own.  There, I would say — if we are looking truly for an example in our day — is an <i>authentic</i> rendition of the labor of Love.</p>
+
+<p>In the religious lore of India there is a formulation of five degrees of love through which a worshiper is increased in the service and knowledge of God — which is to say, in the Indian sense, in the realization of his own identity with that Being of all beings who in the beginning said "I" and then realized, "I am all this world!"  The first degree of such love is of servant to master: "O Lord, you are the Master; I am the servant. Command, and I shall obey!"  This, according to the Indian teaching, is the appropriate spiritual attitude for most worshipers of divinities, no matter where in the world.</p>
+
+<p><img align="left" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/krishna_arjuna.jpg" width="291" height="284" border="0" alt="Krishna smiles on Arjuna">The second order of love, then, is that of friend to friend, which in the Christian tradition is typified in the relationship of Jesus and his apostles.  They were friends.  They could discuss and even argue questions.  But such love implies a deeper readiness of understanding, a higher spiritual development than the first.  In the Hindu scriptures it is represented in the great conversation of the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i> between the Pandava prince <a href="http://www.atmajyoti.org/hi_gita_commentary_2.asp" target="new" class="bodylink">Arjuna</a> and his divine charioteer, the Lord Krishna.</p>
+
+<p>The next, or third, degree of love is that of parent for child, which in the Christian world is represented in the image of the Christmas Crib.  One is here cultivating in one's heart the inward divine child of one's own awakened spiritual life — in the sense of the mystic Meister Eckhart's words when he said to his congregation: "It is more worth to God his being brought forth spiritually in the individual virgin or good soul than that he was born of Mary bodily."  And again: "God's ultimate purpose is birth.  He is not content until he brings his Son to birth in us."  In Hinduism, it is in the popular worship of the naughty little "butter thief," Krishna the infant among the cowherds by whom he was reared, that this theme is most charmingly illustrated.  And in the modern period there is the instance of the troubled woman already mentioned, supra, p. 100, who came to the Indian saint and sage Ramakrishna, saying, "O Master, I do not find that I love God." And he asked, "Is there nothing, then, that you love?"  To which she answered, "My little nephew." And he said to her, "There is your love and service to God, in your love and service to that child."</p>
+
+<p>The fourth degree of love is that of spouses for each other. The Catholic nun wears the wedding ring of her spiritual marriage to Christ.  So too is every marriage in love spiritual.  In the words attributed to Jesus, "The two shall be one flesh." For the "precious thing" then is no longer oneself, one's individual life, self-transcended in that knowledge.   In India the wife is to worship her husband as her lord; her service to him is the measure of her religion. (However, we do not hear there anything like as much of the duties of a husband to his wife.)</p>
+
+<p><img align="right" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/Krishna_Radha.jpg" width="283" height="388" border="0" alt="Krishna with Radha">And so now, finally, what is the fifth, the highest order of love, according to this Indian series?  It is passionate, illicit love.  In marriage, it is declared, one is still possessed of reason.  One still enjoys the goods of this world and one's place in the world, wealth, social position and the rest.  Moreover, marriage in the Orient is a family-made arrangement, having nothing whatsoever to do with what in the West we now think of as love.  The seizure of passionate love can be, in such a context, only illicit, breaking in upon the order of one's dutiful life in virtue as a devastating storm.  And the aim of such a love can be only that of the moth in the image of Hallaj: to be annihilated in the love's fire.  In the legend of the Lord Kishna, the model is given of the passionate yearning of the young incarnate god for his mortal married mistress, Radha, and of her reciprocal yearning for him. To quote once again the mystic Ramakrishna, who in his devotion to the goddess Kali was himself, all his life, such a lover: "When one has loved God in this way, sacrificing all for the vision of his face, 'O my Lord,' one can say, 'now reveal thyself!' and he will <i>have</i> to respond."</p>
+
+<p>There is the figure also, in India, of the Lord Krishna playing his flute at night in the forest of Vrindavan, at the sound of whose irresistible strains young wives would slip from their husband's beds and, stealing to the moonlit wood, dance the night through with their beautiful young god in transcendent bliss.</p>
+
+<p>The underlying thought here is that in the rapture of love one is transported beyond temporal laws and relationships, these pertaining only to the secondary world of apparent separateness and multiplicity.  Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, in the same spirit, sermonizing in the twelfth century on the Biblical text of the <i>Song of Songs</i>, represented the yearning of the soul for God as both beyond the law and beyond reason.  Moreover, the excruciating separation and conflict of the two orders of moral commitment, of reason on one hand, and passionate love on the other, have been a source of Christian anxiety since the beginning.  "The desires of the flesh are against the 'Spirit,'" wrote Saint Paul, for example, to the Galatians, "and the desires of the Spirit, against the flesh."</p>
+
+<p>Saint Bernard's contemporary Abelard saw the highest exemplification of God's love for man in the descent of the son of God to the earth to become flesh and his submission to death on the cross.  In Christian hermaneutics the crucifixion of the Savior had always presented a great problem; for Jesus, according to Christian belief, accepted death voluntarily.  Why?  In Abelard's view, it was not, as some in his day had proposed, as a ransom paid to Satan, to "redeem" mankind for his keep; nor was it, as others held, as a payment to the Father, in "atonement" for Adam's sin.  Rather, it was an act of willing self-immolation in love, intended to invoke in response the return of mankind's love from worldly concerns to God.  And that Christ may not have actually suffered in that loving act we may take from a saying of the mystic Meister Eckhart: "To him who suffers but not for love, to suffer is suffering and hard to bear.  But one who suffers for love suffers not, and his suffering is fruitful in God's sight."</p>
+
+<p>Indeed, the very idea of a descent of God into the world of love to invoke, in return, man's love to God, seems to me to imply exactly the contrary to the statement I have just quoted of Saint Paul.  Implied, rather, it seems to me, is the idea that as mankind yearns for the grace of God, so God for the homage of mankind, the two yearnings being reciprocal.  And the image of the crucified as both true God and true man would then seem to bring to focus the matched terms of a <i>mutual</i> sacrifice — in the way not of atonement in the penal sense, but of at-one-ment in the marital.  And further: when extended to symbolize not only the one historic moment of Christ's crucifixion on Calvary, but the mystery through all time and space of God's presence and participation in the agony of all living things, the sign of the cross would then have to be looked upon as the sign of an eternal affirmation of all that is, ever was, or shall be.  One thinks of Christ's words reported in the Gnostic <i>Gospel According to Thomas</i>: "Cleave a piece of wood, I am there; lift up the stone, you will find me there." Also those of Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i>, where he states that time is "the moving image of Eternity." Or again, those of William Blake: "Eternity is in love with the productions of time." And there is a memorable passage in the writings of Thomas Mann, where he celebrates man as a noble meeting [<i>eine hohe Begegnung</i>] of Spirit and Nature in their yearning way to each other."</p>
+
+<p>We can safely say, therefore, that whereas some moralists may find it possible to make a distinction between two spheres and reigns — one of flesh, the other of spirit, one of time, the other of eternity — wherever love arises such definitions vanish, and a sense of life awakens in which all such opposites are at one.</p>
+
+<p><img align="left" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/Kuan_Yin.jpg" width="323" height="503" border="0" alt="Kuan Yin">The most widely revered Oriental personification of such a world-affirming attitude, transcending opposites, is that figure of boundless compassion already discussed at considerable length, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, known to China and Japan as Kuan Yin, Kwannon.  For, in contrast to the Buddha, who at the conclusion of his lifetime of teaching passed away, never to return, this infinitely compassionate one, who renounced for himself eternal release to remain forever in this vortex of rebirths, represents through all time the mystery of a knowledge of eternal release while living.  The liberation thus taught is, paradoxically, not of escape from the vortex, but of full participation voluntarily in its sorrows — moved by compassion; for indeed, through selflessness one is released from self, and with release from self there is release from desire and fear.  And as the Bodhisattva is thus released, so too are we, according to the measure of our experience of the perfection of compassion.</p>
+
+<p>It is said that ambrosia pours from the Bodhisattva's fingertips even to the deepest pits of Hell, giving comfort there to the souls still locked in the torture chambers of their passions.  We are told, furthermore, that in all our dealings with each other we are his agents, whether knowingly or not.  Nor is it the aim of the Bodhisattva to change — or, as we like to say, to "improve" — this temporal world.  Conflict, tension, defeats, and victories are inherent in the nature of things, and what the Bodhisattva is doing is participating in the nature of things.  He is benevolence without purpose.  And since <i>all</i> life is sorrowful, and necessarily so, the answer cannot lie in turning—or "progressing"— from one form of life to another, but only in dissolving the organ of suffering itself, which — as we have seen — is the idea of an ego to be preserved, committed to its own compelling concepts of what is good and what is evil, true and false, right and wrong; which dichotomies — as we have likewise seen — are dissolved in the metaphysical impulse of compassion.</p>
+
+<p>Love as <i>passion</i>; love as <i>compassion</i>: these are the two extreme poles of our subject.  They have often been represented as absolutely opposed — physical, respectively, and spiritual; yet in both the individual is torn out of himself and opened to an experience of rediscovered identity in a larger, more abiding format.  And in both it is the work of Eros, eldest and youngest of the gods, that we must recognize: the same who in the beginning, as told in the ancient Indian myth, poured himself forth in creation.</p>
+
+<p>In the Occident the most impressive representation of love as <i>passion</i> is to be found in the legend of the love potion of Tristan and Isolt, where it is the paradoxology of the mystery that is celebrated: the agony of love's joy, and the lovers' joy in that agony, which is by noble hearts experienced as the very ambrosia of life. "I have undertaken a labor," wrote the greatest of the great Tristan poets, Gottfried von Strassburg, from whose version of the legend Wagner took the inspiration for his opera, "a labor out of love for the world and to comfort noble hearts: those that I hold dear, and the world to which my heart goes out." But then he adds: "Not the common world do I mean, of those who (as I have heard) cannot bear grief and desire but to bathe in bliss. (May God let them dwell in bliss!) Their world and manner of life my tale does not regard: its life and mine lie apart. Another world do I hold in mind, which bears together in one heart its bitter sweetness and its dear life and sorrowful death, dear death and sorrowful life. In this world let me have my world, to be damned with it, or to be saved."</p>
+
+<p>Do we not recognize here an echo of that same metaphysically grounded sense of a coincidence and transcendence of opposites that we have already found symbolized in the figures of Satan and Hell, Christ on the cross, and the moth consumed in the flame?</p>
+
+<p>However, in the medieval European experience and understanding of love, as interpreted not only by Gottfried and the Tristan poets, but also by the troubadours and Minnesingers of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, there is an altogether different tone from anything of the Orient, whether of the Far, Middle, or Near East.  Essentially, the Buddhist quality of "compassion," <i>karuna</i>, is equivalent to the Christian of "charity," <i>agape</i>, which is epitomized in the admonition of Christ to love your neighbor as yourself! — and even better, beyond that, in the words that I take to be the highest, the noblest and boldest of Christian teaching: "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust...."</p>
+
+<p>In all the great traditional representations of love as compassion, charity, or <i>agape</i>, the operation of the virtue is described as general and impersonal, transcending differences and even loyalties.  And against this higher, <i>spiritual</i> order of love there is set generally in opposition the lower, of lust, or, as it is so often called, "animal passion," which is equally general and impersonal, transcending differences and even loyalties.  Indeed, one could describe the latter most accurately, perhaps, simply as the zeal of the organs, male and female, for each other, and designate the writings of Sigmund Freud as the definitive modern text on the subject of such love.  However, in the European twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, in the poetry first of the troubadours of Provence, and then, with a new accent, of the Minnesingers, a way of experiencing love came to expression that was altogether different from either of those two as traditionally opposed.  And since I regard this typical and exclusive European chapter of our subject as one of the most important mutations not only of human feeling, but also of the spiritual consciousness of our human race, I am going to dwell on it a little, before proceeding to the final passages of this chapter.</p>
+
+<p>To begin with, then: Marriage in the Middle Ages was almost exclusively a social, family concern — as it has been forever, of course, in Asia, and is to this day for many in the West.  One was married according to family arrangements. Particularly in aristocratic circles, young women hardly out of girlhood were married off as political pawns.  And the Church, meanwhile, was sacramentalizing such unions with its inappropriately mystical language about the two that were now to be of one flesh, united through love and by God: and let no man put asunder what God hath joined.  Any actual experience of love could enter into such a system only as a harbinger of disaster.  For not only  could one be burned at the stake in punishment for adultery, but according to current belief, one would also burn forever in Hell.  And yet love came, even so, to such noble hearts as were celebrated by Gottfried; not only came, but was invited in.  And it was the work of the troubadours to celebrate this passion, which in their view was of a divine grace altogether higher in dignity than the sacraments of marriage, and if excluded from Heaven, then sanctified in Hell.  And that the word <i>AMOR</i> was the reverse in spelling of <i>ROMA</i> seemed marvelously to epitomize the sense of the contrast.</p>
+
+<p>But wherein, then, lay the special quality of this new order of love, the love that was neither <i>agape</i> nor <i>eros</i>, but <i>amor</i>?</p>
+
+<p>Debates of the troubadours on the subject were a favorite theme of their poems, and the most fitting definition achieved was that which has been preserved to us in a stanza by one of the most respected of their number, <a href="http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/giraut_de_bornelh/index.php" target="new" class="bodylink">Guiraut de Bronelh</a>, to the point that <i>amor</i> is discriminative — personal and specific — born of the <i>eyes</i> and the <i>heart</i>.</p>

+<p></p>
+
+<p>To be noted well: such a noble love is <i>not</i> indiscriminate.  It is not a "love thy neighbor as thyself no matter who he may be"; not <i>agape</i>, charity or compassion.  Nor is it an expression of the general will to sex, which is equally indiscriminate.  it is of the order, that is to say, neither of Heaven nor of Hell, but of earth; grounded in the psyche of a particular individual and, specifically, in the predilection of his eyes: their perception of another specific individual and communication of her image to his heart — which is to be (as we are told in other documents of the time) a "noble" or "gentle" heart, capable of the emotion of love, <i>amor</i>, not simply lust.</p>
+
+<p>And what, then, would be the nature of a love so born?</p>
+
+<p>In the various contexts of Oriental erotic mysticism, whether of the Near East or of India, the woman is mystically interpreted as an occasion for the lover to experience depths beyond depths of transcendent illumination — much in the way of Dante's  appreciation of Beatrice.  Not so among the troubadours.  The beloved to them was a woman, not the manifestation of some divine principle; and specifically, <i>that</i> woman.  The love was for <i>her</i>, and the celebrated experience was an agony of earthly love: an effect of the fact that the union of love can never be absolutely realized on this earth.  Love's joy is in its savor of eternity; love's pain, the passage of time; so that (as in Gottfried's words) "bitter sweetness and dear grief" are of its essence.  And for those "who cannot bear grief, and desire but to bathe in bliss," the ambrosial potion of this greatest gift of life is a drink too strong.  Gottfried even deified Love as a goddess, and brought his bewildered couple to her hidden wilderness-chapel, known as "The Grotto for People in Love," where stood, in the place of an altar, the noble crystalline bed of love.</p>
+
+<p><img align="right" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/Tristan_Isolde_wedding_stained_glass.jpg" width="300" height="337" border="0" alt="Wedding of Tristan and Isolde">Moreover — and this, to me, is the most profoundly moving passage in Gottfried's version of the legend — when, on the ship sailing from Ireland (with which scene Wagner's opera commences), the young couple unwittingly drank the potion and became gradually aware of the love that for some time had been quietly growing in their hearts, Brangaene, the faithful servant who by chance had left the fateful flask unattended, said to them in dire warning, "That flask and what it contained will be the death of you both!" To which Tristan answered, "So then, God's will be done, whether death it be or life. For that drink has poisoned me sweetly. I do not know what the death of which you tell is to be, but <i>this</i> death suits me well. And if delightful Isolt is to continue to be my death this way, I shall gladly court an eternal death."</p>
+
+<p>What Brangaene had meant was only physical death.  Tristan's reference to "<i>this</i> death," however, was to the rapture of his love; and his reference then to "an eternal death" was to an eternity in Hell — which for a medieval Catholic was no mere flourish of speech.</p>
+
+<p>I think of that Moslem figure of Satan, the great lover of God, in God's Hell.  And when I recall, furthermore, in the light of these words of Tristan, that scene of Dante's <i>Inferno</i> where the poet, describing his passage through the circle of the carnal sinners, tells of having beheld there, carried past on a burning wind, the whirling, screaming souls of all the most famous lovers of history — Semiramis, Helen, Cleopatra, Paris and yes! Tristan, too; telling of how he had spoken there.  Francesca da Rimini in the arms of her husband's brother Paolo, asking what had brought those two to that terrible eternity; and she told him of how they had been reading together of Guinevere and Lancelot and at a certain moment, looking at each other, kissed, all trembling, and read no more in the book that day.... When I recall, as I say, that passage in the light of Tristan's welcome of "an eternal death," I cannot help wondering whether Dante could have been quite correct in regarding the condition of his souls in Hell as of unmitigated pain.  His point of view was that of an outsider; one, furthermore, whose own love was bearing him onward and upward to the summit of the highest Heaven. Whereas Paolo and Francesca had the inside point of view of a passion of a much more fiery sort, for a clue to whose terrible joy we may take the word of another visionary, William Blake, in <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>: "As I was walking among the fires of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments of genius which to Angels look like torment and insanity...." For the point about Hell — as of Heaven — is this: when there, you are in your proper place, which, finally, is exactly where you want to be.</p>
+
+<p>The same point has been made in Jean-Paul Sartre's play <i><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/sart.html" target="new" class="bodylink">No Exit</a></i>, where the setting is a hotel room in Hell, sparely furnished in Second Empire style and with an image of Eros on the mantel.  Into this single chamber three permanent guests are to be introduced by the bellhop, one by one.</p>
+
+<p>The first, a middle-aged pacifist journalist, has just this minute been shot as a deserter, and what his pride now most requires is to be told that his attempt to escape to Mexico and publish there a pacifist magazine was heroic; he was not a coward.  The second to be ushered in, then, is a Lesbian who lost her life when a young wife whom she had seduced turned on the gas secretly in her apartment and expired with her, asphyxiated, in bed.  Immediately despising the craven male who is to be her companion here forever, this coldly intellectual female gives him no comfort whatsoever in his need.  Nor can the next and final entrant, a man-crazy young thing who had drowned her illegitimate child and driven her lover to suicide.</p>
+
+<p>This second female, of course, becomes immediately interested in the male, who requires, however, not passion but compassion.  The Lesbian blocks every attempt they make to reach some kind of accord, making moves of her own, meanwhile, toward the other female, who has neither any interest in, nor understanding of what she wants.  And when these three — so exquisitely matched — have brought their unrelenting demands on each other to such a pitch of frustration that escape, one way or the other, would seem to be the only thing that anyone in such a spot could desire, the locked door of their room swings open — showing an azure void — and nobody leaves.  The door swings shut, and they are locked forever in their chosen cell.</p>

+
+<p>Bernard Shaw says much the same in Act III of his <i>Man and Superman</i>: that delicious scene where a little old lady, faithful daughter of Mother Church, is informed that the landscape through which she is happily strolling is not of Heaven but Hell.  She is indignant.  "I tell you, I know I am not in Hell," she insists, "because I feel no pain." Well, if she likes (she is told), she can easily stroll on over the hill into Heaven.  However, the strain of remaining there has been found intolerable (she is warned) for those who are happy in Hell.  There are a few — and they are mostly English — who nevertheless remain, not because they are happy, but because they think they owe it to their position to be in Heaven.  "An Englishman," states her informer, "thinks he is moral when he is only uncomfortable." And with that telling Shavian quip, I am carried to my final reflections on this chapter's theme.</p>
+
+<p>For it was in the legend of the Holy Grail that the healing work was symbolized through which the world torn between honor and love, as represented in the Tristan legend, was to be cured of its irresolution.  The intolerable spiritual disorder of the period was represented in this highly symbolic tale in the figure of a "waste land" — the same that T.S. Eliot in his poem of that name, published in 1922, adopted to characterize the condition of our own troubled time.  Every natural impulse in that period of ecclesiastical despotism was branded as corrupt, with the only recognized means of "redemption" vested in sacraments administered by authorities who were themselves indeed corrupt.  People were forced to profess and live by beliefs they did not always actually hold.  The imposed moral order held precedence over the claims of both truth and love.  The pains of Hell were illustrated on earth in the torture of adulteresses, heretics, and other villains, torn apart or set afire in public squares.  And all hope of anything better was pitched high aloft to that celestial estate of which Gottfried spoke with such scorn, where those who could bear neither grief nor desire were to be bathed in a bliss everlasting.</p>
+
+<p><img align="right" img="" src="./Mythic Imagination Institute - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By_files/parzival.jpg" width="350" height="329" border="0" alt="Parzival">In the legend of the Grail, as rendered in the <i>Parzival</i> of Gottfried's very great contemporary and leading literary rival, Wolfram von Eschenbach, this devastation of Christendom is symbolically attributed to the awesome wounding of the young Grail King Anfortas, the meaning of whose name is "infirmity"; and the expected issues of the awaited Grail Knight was to be the healing of this dreadfully wounded youth.  Anfortas — significantly — had only inherited, not rightly earned, the high office of guardianship of the supreme symbol of the spiritual life. He had not, that is to say, been properly proven to his role, but instead still moved in the natural way of youth.  And like all noble youths of that period, he rode forth one day from the Castle of the Grail with the battle cry "<i>Amor!</i>"  And he encountered immediately a pagan knight from a land not far from the walled garden of Paradise, who had come riding in quest of the Grail and with its name engraved on his spearhead.  The two settled their lances, rode at each other, and the pagan knight was slain. But his lance, inscribed with the name of the Grail, had already unsexed the young king, and its head, broken off, remained in the excruciating wound.</p>
+
+<p>This calamity, in Wolfram's meaning, was symbolic of the dissociation within Christendom of spirit from nature; the denial of nature as corrupt, the imposition of what was supposed to be an authority <i>super</i>naturally endowed, and the actual demolishment of both nature and truth in consequence.  The healing of the maimed king, therefore, could be accomplished only by an uncorrupted youth <i>naturally</i> endowed, who would merit the supreme crown through his own authentic life work and experience, motivated by a spirit of unflinching noble love, enduring loyalty, and spontaneous compassion.  Such a one was Parzival.  And though we cannot in these few pages review the whole course of his symbolic career, enough can be said of four of the main episodes to suggest the burden of the poet's healing message.</p>
+
+<p>The noble youth had been reared by his widowed mother in a forest aloof from the courtly world, and it was only when he chanced to see a small company of questing knights go riding past his farm that he learned of knighthood and, abandoning his mother, set forth for King Arthur's court. His training in courtesy and in the skills of knightly combat he received from Gurnemanz, an old nobleman who admired his obvious qualities and offered him his daughter in marriage. But Parzival, thinking, "I must not simply accept, I must <i>earn</i>, my wife!" courteously, gently refused the gift and, alone again, rode away.</p>
+
+<p>He let the reins lie slack on his charger's neck, and was thus carried by the will of nature (his mount) to the besieged castle of an orphaned queen his own age, Condwiramurs (<i>conduire amour</i>) whom he next day heroically rescued from the undesired assaults  of a king who had hoped to add her feudal estates through capture and marriage to his own. And it was she, then, that lovely young queen, who became the wife he had earned; and there was no priest to solemnize the marriage — the poet Wolfram's healing message here being that noble love alone is the sanctification of marriage, and loyalty in marriage, the confirmation of love.</p>
+
+<p>Proposition two, to which the poet then addressed himself, was of human nature fulfilled — not overcome or transcended — in the achievement of that supreme spiritual goal of which the Grail was the medieval symbol. For it was only <i>after</i> Parzival had met the normal secular challenges of his day — both in knightly deeds and in marriage — that he became involved without either forewarning or intent in the unpredicted, unpredictable context of the higher spiritual adventure symbolized in the Grail Castle and wondrous healing of its king.  The mystical law governing the adventure required that the hero to achieve it should have no knowledge of its task or rules, but accomplish all spontaneously on the impulse of his nature.  The castle would appear like a vision before him.  Its drawbridge lowering, he would ride across it to a joyous welcome.  And the task then expected of him, when the maimed king on his litter would be carried into the stately hall, would be simply to ask what ailed him.  The wound would immediately heal, the waste land become green, and the saving hero himself be installed as king.  However, on the occasion of his first arrival and reception, Parzival, though moved to compassion, politely held his peace; for he had been taught by Gurnemanz that a knight does not ask questions.  Thus he allowed concern for his social image to inhibit the impulse of his nature — which, of course, was exactly what everyone else in the world was doing in that period and was the cause of all that was wrong.</p>
+
+<p>Well, to cut a long and wonderful story very short, the result of this suppression of the dictate of his heart was that the young, misguided knight — scorned, humiliated, cursed, derided, and exiled from the precincts of the Grail —  was so shamed and baffled by what had happened that he bitterly cursed God for what he took to have been a mean deception practiced upon him, and for years he rode in desperate, solitary quest, to achieve again that castle of the Grail and release its suffering king.  Indeed, even after learning from a forest hermit that it was God's law of that enchantment that none seeking the castle would find it and none who had failed once should ever have a second chance, the resolute youth persisted, moved by compassion for its terribly maimed king, whom his failure had left in such pain.</p>
+
+<p>But his ultimate victory followed, ironically, rather from his loyalty to Condwiramurs and fearlessness in combat than from his obdurate determination to rediscover the castle. The immediate occasion was a great and gallant wedding feast — with many a fair lady thereabout and much fashionable dalliance among colorful pavilions —  from which he rode away, not in moral dudgeon but because, with the image of Condwiramurs in his heart (whom he had not seen through all these cruel years of unrelenting quest), he could not bring himself to engage in any of the pleasures of that marvelously fair occasion.  He rode away alone.  And he had not ridden far when there came charging at him from a nearby wood a brilliant knight of Islam.</p>
+
+<p>Now Parzival had known for some time that he had an elder half-brother, a Moslem; and it happened that this was he.  They clashed and gave battle fiercely, "And I mourn for this," wrote Wolfram; "for they were the two sons of one man. One could say that 'they' were fighting, if one wished to speak of two. Those two, however, were one.: 'My Brother and I' is one body, like good man and good wife. Contending here from loyalty of heart, one flesh, one blood, was doing itself much harm."<font size="2"><sup>1</sup></font>  The battle scene is a recapitulation transformed of the encounter of Anfortas with the pagan.  Parzival's sword, however, here broke on the other's helmet.  The Moslem flung his own blade away, scorning to murder a defenseless knight, and the two sat down to what proved to be a recognition scene.</p>
+
+<p>Clearly implicit in this critical meeting is an allegorical reference to the two opposed religions of the time, Christianity and Islam: "two noble sons," so to say, "of one father." And marvelously, when the two brothers have found their accord, a messenger of the Grail appears to invite <i>both</i> to the castle — which in a Christian work of the time of the Crusades is a detail surely remarkable!  The maimed king is healed, Parzival is installed in his stead, and the Moslem, taking the Grail Maiden to wife (in whose virgin hands alone the symbolic vessel had been carried), departs with her to his Orient, there to reign in truth and love — seeing to it (as the text declares) "that his people should gain their rights."</p>
+
+<p>But this wonderful <i>Parzival</i> of Wolfram von Eschenbach simply has to be read.<font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font> Humorous, joyous, altogether different both in spirit and in meaning from the ponderous opus of Richard Wagner, it is one of the richest, greatest, most civilized works of the European Middle Ages; and as a monument, moreover, to the world-saving power of love in all its forms, perhaps the very greatest love story of all time.</p>
+
+<p>So let me now, in conclusion, turn to the writings of an author of our own day, Thomas Mann, who already in his earliest novelette, <i>Tonio Kröger</i>, named love the controlling principle of his art.</p>
+
+<p>The young North German hero of this story, whose mother was a woman of Latin race, found himself set apart from his blue-eyed blond companions, not only physically, but also temperamentally.  It was with a curiously melancholy strain of intellectual contempt that he regarded them; yet with envy also, mixed of admiration and love. Indeed, in his secret heart, he pledged himself to them all eternally — and particularly a certain charming blue-eyed Hans and beautiful blond Ingeborg, who represented to him irresistibly the appeal of fresh human beauty and youthful life.</p>
+
+<p>On coming of age, Tonio left the north to seek his destiny as a writer, and, moving to a city of the South, met there a young Russian, Lisaveta by name, and her circle of heavy thinkers.  He there found himself no more at home, however, among those critics and despisers of the commonalty of the human race, than he had formerly felt among the objects of their scorn.  He was thus between two worlds, "a lost burgher," as he termed himself; and departing from this second scene mailed back, one day, to the critical Lisaveta and epistolary manifesto, setting forth his credo as an artist.</p>
+
+<p>The right word, <i>le mot juste</i>, he had recognized, can wound; can even kill. Yet the duty of the writer must be to observe and to name exactly: wounding, even possibly killing.  For what the writer must name in describing are inevitably imperfections.  Perfection in life does not exist; and if it did, it would be — not lovable but admirable, possibly even a bore.  Perfection lacks personality. (All the Buddhas, they say, are perfect, perfect and therefore alike. Having gained release from the imperfections of this world, they have left it, never to return. But the Bodhisattvas, remaining, regard the lives and deeds of this imperfect world with eyes and tears of compassion.) For let us note well (and here is the high point of Mann's thinking on this subject): what is lovable about any human being is precisely his imperfections. The writer is to find the right words for these and to send them like arrows to their mark — but with a balm, the balm of love, on every point. For the mark, the imperfection, is exactly what is personal, human, natural, in the object, and the umbilical point of its life.</p>
+
+<p>"I admire," wrote Tonio Kröger to his intellectual friend, "those proud and cold beings who adventure on paths of great daemonic beauty and despise 'mankind'; but I do not envy them.  Because {and here he lets fly his own dart} if there is anything capable of making a poet of a literary man, it is this burgherlike love that I feel for the human, the commonplace.  All warmth, goodness, and humor derives from this; and it even seems to me that it must be itself that love of which it is written that one may speak with the tongues of men and of angels and yet, having it not, be as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals..."</p>
+
+<p>"Erotic" or "plastic irony," is the name that Thomas Mann bestowed on this principle; and through the greater part of his creative career it was the guiding principle of his art. The unflinching eye detects, the intellect names, the heart goes out in compassion; and the life-force of every life-loving heart will be finally tested, challenged, and measured by its capacity to regard with such compassion whatever has been by the eye perceived and by the intellect named. "For God," as we read in Paul to the Romans, "has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may show his mercy to all."</p>
+
+<p>Moreover, life itself, we can be sure, will provide every one of us ultimately with a test of our capacity for such love — as it in time tested Thomas Mann, with its transformation of his blue-eyed Hans and blonde Ingeborg, under Hitler, into what he could only name and describe as depraved monsters...</p>
+
+<p>What does one do under such a test?</p>
+
+<p>Saint Paul has said, "Love bears all things." We have the words also of Jesus: "Judge not that you may not be judged." And there is the saying, too, of Heraclitus: "To God all things are fair and good and right; but men hold some things wrong and some right. Good and evil are one."</p>
+
+<p>There is a deep and terrible mystery here, which we perhaps cannot, or possibly simply will not, comprehend; yet which will have to be assimilated if we are to meet such a test. For love is exactly as strong as life. And when life produces what the intellect names evil, we may enter into righteous battle, contending "from loyalty of heart": however, if the principle of love (Christ's "Love your enemies!") is lost thereby, our humanity too will be lost.</p>
+
+<p>"Man," in the words of the American novelist Hawthorne, "must not disclaim his brotherhood even with the guiltiest."</p>

+I wish to comment on the downvoting and general first reaction. I expected this, but I also wish it didn't have to happen. This is on-topic, and if you don't see what I see - then commenting that the film isn't deep isn't going to change all the references and citations I have provided.
+
+I *fully* understand that people can enjoy the film by just watching ti once, enjoying some popcorn. It's kind of an insult *to me* that you think I don't know that people can enjoy complex things in simple ways.
+
+But, I wish to make a few points to try and explain why there is a conflict:
+
+- It might seem obvious that the most effective film about Global Climate Change is *An Inconvenient Truth* by Al Gore. Or the kind of films like *Roger and Me* about jobs.  But that's not really what history shows us. What history shows us, is that stories artists are often the best educators - and what may be argued as a fiction story - can in fact have a lot of very illustrating content.
+
+- The favoring of conflict. Reddit itself has had "Fat People Hate" riots. That's exactly what Edward Bernays education systems.  Instead, to avoid having people downvote and negatively review your critical film... an artist has to spend a lot more time making a complex story that hides the topics. *For example* a) A film where a "blight" or "locusts" eat all the plants.  b) Scenes where some plants are said to be troubled and others OK.  c) Themes about books being banned at schools, etc.  d) Odd things that are missing, such as a lack of Films or Music in the lives of the people.
+
+Because when you outright point out the truth - that Advertising and Marketing is taking money from the poor and making the majority of people obese... people reach real quick to change the channel, downvote, or even hit you.  That's how ego defensiveness works.  Nobody really likes to be told that their own country is being tricked, and the TV news is full of lies and "entertainment" and not truth.
+
+Except, our Founding Fathers had seen this.  Do you know that Europe Royalty puts a Crown on the King and Queen heads - that symbolize the Moon and the Sun? And that they dress up to control people?
+
+Richard Feynman is an American Physics Teacher who told us that this is horrible, he hates it, and it corrupts our science.  Did we listen? 
+
+Feynman was telling us that Edward Bernays is corrupting our science and even our thinking.
+
+You have to face some basic truths: 
+
+- Fast Food and Soda are all *factory* food. Not your local guy down the street who owns it and cooks for you
+- They profit a small number of rich people
+- Artists are hired and paid to make art to psycologically inform people that the politicians, food, etc are good. They do not rely on "word of mouth" and peer to peer.
+
+But people get very defensive when you criticize this system. But that's exactly what the American Founding Fathers were saying *not to rely* on.  It get's worse when you find out the lifetime of work by Edward Bernays - and you compare his system of education to that of the Founding Fathers.
+
+Benjerman Frankly, for example, wanted Free Public LIbraries. What do we have today? Strbucks with slow and poor Internet.  Why do we not have the best Public Libraries on the planet, with the best Internet on the planet?  Do you think these things cost that much compared to what the Pentagon spends?  Internet and Public Libraries are incredibly *cheap* - and they are the tools to make *other things cheaper* for ALL PEOPLE.  That's precisely the non-Logic of *Reason* that the Founding Fathers were trying to divorce from Europe Kings and Queens who wore their fancy clothes and Moon and Sun crows - and claimed they were approve bloodlines from *God*.
+
+These topics are covered in the 1986 book, *The Inner Reaches of Outer Space* - except I'm adding Bernays to the equation. Our book author in 1986 was being rather kind and nice on the topic.  But Propaganda is used to sell both Soda, Mobile Phones (Apple), Internet (AT&T) and Music (Apple), etc.
+
+The American Software Patents and Copyright system is a disaster.  The film *Thank You for Smoking* isn't a joke of how Edward Bernays students do things.  The film itself, is a direct reference to Bernay's 1929 Easter Sunday stunt.
+
+You can say "wake up steeple", but that's what the Founding Fathers were saying. And it's one of the most important themes of *Interstellar*.  If you missed the theme, then ask your self? Who educates you the most every week - the public library of Benjerman Franklin or Edward Bernays?
+
+It isn't a conspiracy, it's a philosophy. It isn't a conspiracy, it's a system of psychological control.  It's based on the same kind of mechanics that the Taliban uses to control their people. But violence isn't the most powerful tool. The most powerful tool is *Propeganda* - and making sure fhat famous celeiberties are used on advetising, support politicians, etc.  A Democracy is not about the looks, voice, and style of the person speaking.  That's how Kings and Queens hire speech writers and fashion designers - and build up all this pomp.  In a Democracy - the ideal is PEER to PEER listening, not just to the most upvoted popular voices.

+	<h1>Divided By Zero</h1>
+	By Stephen Alfred Gutknecht.<div>Rev 00050</div>
+	<p>New York Professor Joseph Campbell is a primary source for this document.
+	Proper references to source material are attempted. Please contact if not correct.
+	I declare this document to be <em>Public Domain</em>, free to share, on all the Universe.
+	Donations to support my material life are always welcome, to me personally, and I also suggest the JCF.</p>
+	<p>The title <em>Divided By Zero</em> is a reference to mathmatics. In rational math, it is not possible to divide one or two by zero.
+	"Divide by Zero" is also an <i>exception</i> encountered frequently in computing when a software programmer mistakenly initilizes a variable.
+	Overall, the theme that God can not be divided by man, and that all fiction and non-fiction art (expressions) converge to be indivisible.
+	Science, Religion, Fiction, Non-Fiction and Art - they are all indivisible.  It is only the educations and viewpoints of the human brain that create these artificial divisions.
+	As Campbell fully explains, this is also the <em>Eye of Reason</em> that the Founding Fathers of the United States of America intended to be used in modern democracy.  It is also the Sufi view of Islam.
+	</p>
+
+	<p>The quotes are essential to me. As in my lifetime, I feel deeply that we have ignored the best of human experience - discarding it due to outer wrapping. Further, we have mostly accepted the worst of new learning techniques, only due to the fast immediate payoff (Edward Bernays teachings). The quotes are important to shared context, as it must be seen how little attention has been given to these public broadcasts that have collected dust - and how they interconnect. Most of all, I am always in a state of sadness, seeing the symbol of the Founding Fathers Eye of Reason in tears, as our Symbolic Eagle was created pointing at the Olive Branch. During my life, we have had homeland peacetime - but we have ignored these deeper educators - wasting our peace in building for the next wartime.  When do we really choose to confront our society ego issues and listen to our Troubadour artists?  The songs and other art do not provide escape for me, they provide reminders of the Olive Branch that we seem to have forgotten.</p>

+		<li>James Joyce; ~1917, fiction Stephen's conversation in Ulysses: <span class="quoteA">&quot;History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake&quot;</span></li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM, on the USA $1 Bill Pyramid: <span class="quoteA">&quot;If you look behind that pyramid, you see a desert.
+		   If you look before it, you see plants growing. The desert, the tumult in Europe, wars and wars and wars
+		    -- we have pulled ourselves out of it and created a state in the name of <em>Reason</em>, <span class="quoteH0">not in the name of power</span>, and out of that will come the flowerings of the new life. That's the sense of that part of the pyramid.&quot;</span></li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM: <span class="quoteA">&quot;<span class="quoteH0">this is the ground of what the [future] myth is to be</span>. It's already here: the <em>Eye of Reason</em>, not of my nationality; the Eye of Reason, not of my religious community; the Eye of Reason, not of my linguistic community. Do you see?
+			And this would be the <span class="quoteH0">philosophy for the planet</span>, not for this group, that group, or the other group. 
+			When you see the earth from the moon, you don't see any divisions there of nations or states. This might be the symbol, really, for the new mythology to come. That is the country that we are going to be celebrating. And those are the people that we are one with.&quot;</span></li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM: <span class="quoteA">&quot;The shaman is the person, male or female, who in his late childhood or early youth has an overwhelming psychological experience that turns him totally inward.
+			It's a kind of schizophrenic crack-up. The whole unconscious opens up, and the shaman falls into it.
+			This shaman experience has been described many, many times. It occurs all the way from Siberia right through the Americas down to Tierra del Fuego.&quot;</li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM: <span class="quoteA">&quot;I have attended a number of <span class="quoteH0">psychological conferences</span> dealing with this whole problem of the difference between the <span class="quoteH0">mystical experience and the psychological crack-up</span>. The difference is that the one who cracks up is drowning in the water in which the mystic swims. You have to be prepared for this experience.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Campbell; March 4, 1970; Cooper Union; [topic:  Dr. John Perry of San Francisco]
+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;Then Dr. Perry sent me a copy of a paper that he had written on schizophrenia that had been <span class="quoteH0">published in 1963 in the <i>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</i></span>.
+			And to my great amazement I found that the imagery of the schizophrenic paralleled almost point for point the themes that I had rendered in
+			<span class="quoteH0"><i>The Hero With a Thousand Faces</i>, back in 1949</span>, which was based simply on a comparative study of mythology.
+			It had nothing to do with psychoanalysis, or psychology, but it was simply a synthesis of the materials and imageries of the mythological traditions of mankind, delineating the main constant motifs that did appear in all.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now, eternity is beyond all categories of thought. This is an important point in all of the great Oriental religions. We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can't be told because they transcend thought. 
+			The <span class="quoteH0">second best are misunderstood</span>, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can't be thought about. The <span class="quoteH0">third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field</span> of reference to what is absolutely transcendent.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1974 audio lecture: <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now I was reading shortly before coming here a work by Abraham Maslow, a wonderful psychologist, a very important psychologist, one whom I most delight in reading. And he was speaking of what he called a “hierarchy of values for which people live,” and the hierarchy was as follows: survival, security, personal relationships, and self-development.
+			Fortunately I was reading those only a day or so ago, and then I began thinking of this lecture today, and I went back to those and I thought, <span class="quoteH0">Well those are exactly the values that have nothing to do with mythology</span>.
+			Mythology is the law of giving yourself, losing yourself.
+			A person who lives by a myth is fascinated by an aspiration for which he will sacrifice security, for which he will sacrifice even his life, for which he will sacrifice friends and everything else.&quot;</span>

+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;This is irrational. That's the point. <span class="quoteH0">All compassion, all sympathy, is irrational. Love is irrational.</span> The rational is always stressing ‘I-thou’ opposites. The mind is in a world of separateness and angular structures. It's a world put together in a way that can be calculated. <span class="quoteH0">Compassion, Love - these jump mathematics</span>.&quot;</span>

+			Wikipedia (multiple authors); Definition of Neurodiversity: <span class="quoteA">&quot;This movement frames autism, bipolarity and other neurotypes as a natural human variation rather than a pathology or disorder, and its advocates reject the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) cured, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human diversity, self-expression, and being."; <span class="quoteH0">"asserting that neurological differences should be recognized and respected as a social category on a par with gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability status.</span>&quot;</span>

+			Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr; Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963); <span class="quoteA">&quot;Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.

+			Stephan A. Hoeller; audio lecture; 1986; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Then there comes lawfulness, which in terms is conscious choicelessness.
+This is when I go and say: because I am born a Jew or baptized a Christian - I accept the law of Moses.
+And I will abrogat my role as a choice choice maker because the choice has been made for me by Moses, by the theologians, by the preachers - whoever the case may be.
+So, here I consciously abrogate my power of choice.
+And that is what the old Gnostics called the psychic level.
+And thirdly, of course, there is the individual who raises above these.
+And who becomes the conscious choice maker.
+But Lest you think this kind of person has a Wonderful time all the time... let me assure you that it's a very difficult path, of course.
+Why? Because it constantly requires consciousness. And to be conscious hurts. It hurts like heck!&quot;</span>

+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;This is the final secret of myth -- to teach you how to penetrate the labyrinth of life in such a way that its spiritual values come through.
+			That is the <span class="quoteH0">problem of Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em></span>, too. The crisis comes in the "middle of the way of our life," when the body is beginning to fade, and another whole constellation of themes comes breaking into your dream world. Dante says that, in the middle year of his life, he was lost in a dangerous wood.
+			And he was threatened there by three animals, symbolizing pride, desire, and fear. Then Virgil, the personification of poetic insight, appeared and conducted him through the labyrinth of hell, which is the place of those fixed to their desires and fears, who can't pass through to eternity.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The <span class="quoteH0">function of art is to reveal</span> this radiance through the created object. When you see the beautiful organization of a fortunately composed work of art, you just say, "Aha!" Somehow it speaks to the order in your own life and leads to the realization of the very things that religions are concerned to render.&quot;</span> 
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; November 16, 1961; <span class="quoteA">&quot;I would say that in most recent times, the <span class="quoteH0">strongest statement of the principle of the individual</span> is that of Nietzsche philosophy and the idea of the Superman [Übermensch].
+			<span class="quoteH0">This has been a greatly misrepresented point of view</span>. There has been a general tendency to confuse Nietzsche’s view of the Superman with his view of the Masterman—they are not the same.
+			<br />
+			Nietzsche speaks of the naive man-animal, powerful in his life, who lacks however, the sense of the spirit. And then there is the principle of what he calls the man of the decadence, who is questioning man’s problems and so forth—the intellectual, the Socratic man who is, as he says, a sick man: the Masterman and the man of the decadence.
+			<br />
+			The <span class="quoteH0">Superman [Übermensch] is the one who embraces both principals</span>, who both has the courage to live, and has the wit to question life—to query it. Thomas Mann in all of his writings used this as his ideal. The ideal of the man with the intellect and the words that kill, that name life, that know all its faults, and yet has the courage and sympathy to love life in its faults, and with its faults, and because of its faults.
+			Nietzsche’s idea of the Superman is beautifully <span class="quoteH0">summarized in Mann’s writings when he speaks of the plastic irony [erotic irony] of the writer’s craft</span>.&quot;<span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Our life evokes our character. <span class="quoteH0">You find out more about yourself as you go on</span>. That's why it's good to be able to put yourself in situations that will evoke your higher nature rather than your lower. "Lead us not into temptation." 
+			Ortega y Gasset talks about the environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a mechanistic interpretation of the world came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive to the hero. The hero is today running up against a hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need. 
+			[...] Quixote saved the adventure for himself by inventing a magician who had just transformed the giants he had gone forth to encounter into windmills. You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not a mechanistic world in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now <span class="quoteH0">it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and behavioristic psychology</span>, that we're nothing but a predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli.
+			This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;the structure and something of the spiritual sense of this adventure can be seen already anticipated in the puberty or initiation rituals of early tribal societies, through which a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult -- to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo.
+			We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone's protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years -- and <span class="quoteH0">if you're going on for your Ph.D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards</span>. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection. That's the basic motif of the universal hero's journey -- leaving one condition and finding the source of life to bring you forth into a richer or mature condition.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; March 1, 1967 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now, most societies are extremely dogmatic and fierce in their integration of the individual. The individual is born as a separate entity. He is carved up, so to say, and made to fit into a pattern that the society requires. It doesn't require a total man; <span class="quoteH0">it requires a part man — not an individual, but a dividuum: someone who has been divided up</span> and put into a notch.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and <span class="quoteH0">a myth is the society's dream. The myth is the public dream</span> and the dream is the private myth. If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn't, you've got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;I don't know where else they come from. They come from the imagination, don't they? The imagination is grounded in the energy of the organs of the body, and these are the same in all human beings. Since imagination comes out of one biological ground, it is bound to produce certain themes. Dreams are dreams. There are certain characteristics of dreams that can be enumerated, no matter who is dreaming them.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now there is another, deeper meaning of dreamtime -- which is of a time that is no time, just an enduring state of being.
+			There is an important myth from Indonesia that tells of this mythological age and its termination. <span class="quoteH0">In the beginning, according to this story, the ancestors were not distinguished as to sex</span>. There were no births, there were no deaths. Then a great public dance was celebrated, and in the course of the dance one of the participants was trampled to death and torn to pieces, and the pieces were buried. At the moment of that killing the sexes became separated, so that death was now balanced by begetting, begetting by death, while from the buried parts of the dismembered body food plants grew. Time had come into being, death, birth, and <span class="quoteH0">the killing and eating of other living beings, for the preservation of life</span>. The timeless time of the beginning had been terminated by a communal crime, a deliberate murder or sacrifice.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The ultimate word in our English language for that which is transcendent is God. But then you have a concept, don't you see? You think of God as the father. Now, in religions where the god or creator is the mother, the whole world is her body. There is nowhere else. The male god is usually somewhere else.
+			<span class="quoteH0">But male and female are two aspects of one principle. The division of life into sexes was a late division. Biologically, the amoeba isn't male and female</span>. The early cells are just cells. They divide and become two by asexual reproduction. I don't know at what levels sexuality comes in, but it's late. That's why it's absurd to speak of God as of either this sex or that sex. The divine power is antecedent to sexual separation.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The difference between the Jungian archetypes of the unconscious and Freud's complexes is that the archetypes of the unconscious are manifestations of the organs of the body and their powers.
+			Archetypes are biologically grounded, whereas the Freudian unconscious is a collection of repressed traumatic experiences from the individual's lifetime. The Freudian unconscious is a personal unconscious, it is biographical. <span class="quoteH0">The Jungian archetypes of the unconscious are biological</span>.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;I think of mythology as the homeland of the muses, the inspirers of art, the inspirers of poetry. To <span class="quoteH0">see life as a poem and yourself participating in a poem</span> is what the myth does for you.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;That would be a mistake in the reading of the symbol. That is reading the words in terms of prose instead of in terms of poetry, <span class="quoteH0">reading the metaphor in terms of the denotation instead of the connotation</span>. 
+			[...]
+			That which is beyond even the concept of reality, that which transcends all thought. The myth puts you there all the time, gives you a line to connect with that mystery which you are. 
+			Shakespeare said that <span class="quoteH0">art is a mirror held up to nature. And that's what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you</span>. When your mind is simply trapped by the image out there so that you never make the reference to yourself, you have misread the image.&quot;</span>

+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;What is unknown is the fulfillment of your own unique life, the <span class="quoteH0">likes of which has never existed on the Earth. And you are the only one who can do it</span>. People can give you clues how to fall down and how to stand up; but when to fall and when to stand, and when you are falling, and when you are standing, this only you can know. And in the way of your own talents is the only way to do it.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The ultimate [Western] dragon is within you, it is your ego clamping you down. [Ego is] What you think you want, what you will to believe, what you think you can afford, what you decide to love, what you regard yourself as bound to. <span class="quoteH0">It may be all much too small, in which case it will nail you down. And if you simply do what your neighbors tell you to do, you're certainly going to be nailed down</span>. Your neighbors are then your dragon as it reflects from within yourself.&quot;</span>

+			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Eternity isn't even a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. <span class="quoteH0">Eternity is that dimension of here and now</span> that all thinking in temporal terms cuts off.&quot;</span>
+		</li>

+
+		<li>
+			Campbell; November 3, 1967 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;When you realize that life was present on this planet for literally millions and hundreds of millions of years before consciousness emerged, and the eye and mind beheld what is here, and when you think of an infant before its <span class="quoteH0">consciousness comes to flower already doing the major job of its life—namely producing a body out of a couple of little cells, bringing forth this miracle, with all of the organs already functioning, none of these organs having asked consciousness what it was functioning for</span>, it being the job of consciousness rather to find out what the body is all about you realize that there's rather a split here between the monstrous thing that life is. Just consider its basic character: it consists of living by eating other lives. Its main character is monstrous. And when consciousness becomes aware of this, there is this sense of terrific awe and horror, but also fascination and recognition, because that is what we are.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; November 3, 1967 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now the mythologies in general take two attitudes toward this. One is that of affirmation; that is to say, reconciling consciousness to the nature of existence. And the other attitude I call the great reversal, which is that of turning all the positives into negatives and rejecting it, saying, “This is something that should not have been; better pull out.”
+
+			Remember Schopenhauer's statement: “Life is something that should not have been.” The Buddha's saying: “All life is a fire.” There is the fire of passion, fire of fear, fire of this, that and the other aspect of life—quench that fire. Nirvana is the quenching of the fire.
+
+			<span class="quoteH0">So we have in general two basic attitudes of the myths that we're going to illustration—one of that of horrendous affirmation, and the other that of no less horrendous withdrawal</span>.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+
+		<li>
+			Carl Jung; The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (1934); <span class="quoteA">&quot;<span class="quoteH0">Why is psychology the youngest of the empirical sciences?</span> Why have we not long since discovered the unconscious and raised up its treasure-house of eternal images? Simply because we had a religious formula for everything psychic — and one that is far more beautiful and comprehensive than immediate experience. Though the Christian view of the world has paled for many people, the symbolic treasure-rooms of the East are still full of marvels that can nourish for a long time to come the passion for show and new clothes. What is more, these images — be they Christian or Buddhist or what you will — are lovely, mysterious, richly intuitive.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+

+			Campbell; February 20, 1961 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now I take Jung’s idea of the individuation as a rather clean-cut example of an Occidental ideal: that one should put on the mask and take it off. When you come home in the evening are you still Mr. President, or do you leave that in the office? <span class="quoteH0">If you keep your mask on, you know what we say of such a person: he is a stuffed shirt</span>. The personality gradually disappears, and this is a particular disaster if one becomes impressed by one’s own mask. Here we have a real mirage phenomenon: nobody there.&quot;</span>
+		</li>

+
+
+	With some leading emphasis:
+
+	<ol>
+		<li>
+			Campbell; (specific year unknown) Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor; Where <span class="quoteH0">Campbell described in kind terms, 50% + 50% = 100% failure of modern education techniques of Religion</span>:
+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Banksy; (specific year unknown) AdBusters; Where <span class="quoteH0">I consider Banksy to be a spiritual device of Troubadour Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's <em>The Little Prince</em> - who inspired cross-culture marriage of John Lennon + Yoko Ono in the creation of the concept of <em>Bagism</em></span>.  Banksy is <i>walking Bagism</i>. Banksy scathingly attacks the modern results of Easter Sunday, New York City, 1929 (Bernays):
+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, <span class="quoteH0">leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area</span>. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			Is it possible to analytically fake popular content of interesting topics? Showing Campbell's idea of common Unified Monomyth of the human brain? Maybe. https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditSimulator/comments/3g9ioz/what_is_rsubredditsimulator/
+		</li>
+		<li>
+			May 8, 1998 Amazon.com review of Skelaton Key to Finnegans Wake; John McConnell; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Campbell spent ~4 years, if memory serves, on this book. He said he finally had to get away from the Wake because everything he read started to sound as though it was from the Wake.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+	</ol>
+
+	I think by now, it is obvious: I find myself like, Stephan A. Hoeller (born in Budapest, Hungary), who declared in this free <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/CJ44.ram">Free Audio Lecture about Campbell</a> - agreeing with almost everything Campbell said about the modern world viewpoints of religion and philosophy. Anyway, a lot of these quotes will be the basis of my own person life experience and book chapters I intend to author.
+	
+	<p>“Life is like arriving late for a movie, having to figure out what was going on without bothering everybody with a lot of questions, and then being unexpectedly called away before you find out how it ends.” ― Joseph Campbell, Creative Mythology (1968)</p>
+	
+	<h3>Initial Quotes, Set 2 - Society non-violence</h3>
+
+	<ol>
+		<li>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Herman W. Read Fieldhouse, Western Michigan University (18 December 1963); "Social Justice and the Emerging New Age":
+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;There are certain things in our nation and in the world which <span class="quoteH0">I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted</span>
+			until the good societies realize -- I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to
+			-- segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry.
+			I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few.
+			I never intend to adjust myself to <span class="quoteH0">the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence</span>.
+			But in a day when sputniks and explorers are dashing through outer space and guided ballistic missiles are carving highways of death through the stratosphere, no nation can win a war. It is no longer the choice between violence and nonviolence. It is either nonviolence or nonexistence...&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>  ملاله یوسفزۍ ;October 8, 2013; [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjGL6YY6oMs">Link Video YouTube</a>]:
+			<span class="quoteA">&quot;I started thinking about that, and <span class="quoteH0">I used to think</span> that the Talib would come, and he would just kill me. But then I said, 'If he comes, what would you do Malala?' then I would reply to myself, 'Malala, just take a shoe and hit him.'
+			But then I said, 'If you hit a Talib with your shoe, then there would be no difference between you and the Talib. You must not treat others with cruelty and that much harshly, <span class="quoteH0">you must fight others but through peace and through dialogue and through education</span>.' Then I said I will tell him how important education is and that 'I even want education for your children as well.' And I will tell him, 'That's what I want to tell you, <span class="quoteH0">now do what you want</span>.'&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Selma Alabama; March 8, 1965; <span class="quoteA">&quot;A man might be afraid his home will get bombed, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot, or beat down by state troopers, and he may go on and live until he's 80. But <span class="quoteH0">he's just as dead at [age] 36 as he would be at 80</span>. The cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died...
+			A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right.
+			A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice.
+			A man dies when he refuses to <span class="quoteH0">take a stand for that which is true</span>.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+	</ol>
+
+
+	<h3>Initial Quotes, Set 3 - Sufi Topics</h3>
+
+	<ol>
+		<li>Campbell; 1974 Audio: <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now the problem that all of the great masters give us is that of finding the inward way and holding to the outer way. This is a formula that the old Sufis worked out in the following way: <span class="quoteH0">they spoke of wearing the outer garment of the law—that is to say, the order of society in which one is living—and wearing the inner garment of the mythic way</span>.
+			Now in order to find the inner garment you have to take off the outer garment and let it go. There is a long season very often of inward turning this way, and throwing the world away.
+			But unless you can put the other garment back on again, you haven’t really come to the sophistication that lets you know that this is that, and that is this—that this outer garment is the outer reflection of the same laws and principles that you’re finding within, so that you should be at ease somehow in the two worlds. This is an old mythological story.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Well, people do experience it. Those in the Middle Ages who experienced it were usually burned as heretics. <span class="quoteH0">One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, "I and the Father are one." He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, a great Sufi mystic said, "I and my beloved are one," and he, too, was crucified</span>. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, "O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works." Another of the Sufi mystics said, "The function of the orthodox [strict] community is to give the mystic his desire, which is a union with God, through mortification and death."&quot;</span>

+		Really, it must be viewed - but her experience with America I share:
+		<span class="quoteA">&quot;And this is a subject that I would love to think about together. When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic. "I liked your book," he said, "<span class="quoteH0">but I wish you had written it differently</span>."&quot;</span>

+	<h3>Initial Quotes, Set 5 - Two Richards</h3>
+
+	Richard Feynman, Richard Stallman.
+
+	<ol>
+		<li>Richard Feynman on Uniforms and Honors; video interview</li>
+		<li>Richard Feynman on Education Book-reading vs. Experience; <a href="http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education">Travels to Brazil sponsored by the USA State Department</a>; please read entire content, multiple times.
+		 Excerpt: <span class="quoteA">&quot;I discovered a very strange phenomenon: I could ask a question, which the students would answer immediately. <span class="quoteH0">But the next time I would ask the question – the same subject, and the same question, as far as I could tell – they couldn’t answer it at all!</span>&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Richard Feynman on Education Book-reading vs. Experience; <a href="http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education">Travels to Brazil sponsored by the USA State Department</a>; please read entire content, multiple times.
+		 Excerpt: <span class="quoteA">&quot;I didn’t expect that. I knew the system was bad, but 100 percent – it was terrible!
+			Since I had gone to Brazil <span class="quoteH0">under a program sponsored by the United States Government</span>, I was asked by the State Department to write a report about my experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the essentials of the speech I had just given. I found out later through the grapevine that the reaction of somebody in the State Department was, “That shows you how dangerous it is to send somebody to Brazil who is so naive.
+			Foolish fellow; he can only cause trouble. He didn’t understand the problems.” <span class="quoteH0">Quite the contrary!</span> I think this person in the State Department was naive to think that because he saw a university with a list of courses and descriptions, that’s what it was.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Richard Stallman; (date not researched); <span class="quoteA">&quot;While corporations dominate society and write the laws, each advance in technology is an opening for them to further restrict its users.&quot;</span></li>
+		<li>Richard Stallman; (date not researched); <span class="quoteA">&quot;I don't have a problem with someone using their talents to become successful, <span class="quoteH0">I just don't think the highest calling is success</span>. Things like freedom and the expansion of knowledge are beyond success, beyond the personal. Personal success is not wrong, but it is limited in importance, and once you have enough of it it is a shame to keep striving for that, instead of for truth, beauty, or justice.&quot;</span></li>
+		<li>
+			Richard Stallman; “Free Software in Ethics and Practice” talk at CMC MSU, Moscow, Russia, (3 March 2008); <span class="quoteA">&quot;Isn't it ironic that the proprietary software developers call us communists? We are the ones who have provided for a free market, where they allow only monopoly. … if the users chooses this proprietary software package, he then falls into this monopoly for support … the only way to escape from monopoly is to escape from proprietary [computer] software, and <span class="quoteH0">that is what the free software movement is all about</span>.&quot;</span>
+		</li>
+		<li>Richard Feynman; Rogers Commission Report; Appendix  F - Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle (9 June 1986);  <span class="quoteA">&quot;Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA officials deal in a world of reality in understanding technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to be actively trying to eliminate them. They must live in reality in comparing the costs and utility of the [Space] Shuttle to other methods of entering space. And they must be realistic in making contracts, in estimating costs, and the difficulty of the projects. Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed, schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way the government would not support them, then so be it. NASA owes it to the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for the use of their limited resources.
+			<span class="quoteH0">For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled</span>.&quot;</span></li>

+<h2>Intention of this Document</h2>
+
+	<p>I, Stephen Alfred Gutknecht, am speaking for myself to defend certain methods of thought, "Eye of Reason" and it's general painful difficulty.  To live in a society where things are divided.</p>
+
+	<p>BE WARNED: This section is a <span class="quoteH0">mess of brainstorm and emotions</span>, not all kind and nice. It needs massive editing, rework, etc. I'm trying to find the center of my topics, it is still very early in this writing.</p>
+
+	general concerns:
+
+	<ol>
+		<li>Compassion for strangers all over the world, what we see on TV and in print, and internalizing it</li>
+		<li>War and fighting over Religon books and conflicting education techniques.  Such as the Nazi attempt to exterminate all the Jewish in World War II.
+		 And the Shia vs. Sunni fighting going on today in Islam/Muslim communities.</li>
+                <li>The merits of art, fiction, and Sufi Islam viewpoints in modern religion</li>
+		<li>The new voice of  ملاله یوسفزۍ  not given the proper attention. Not recognized as the same ideals of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</li>
+		<li>Marriage ideals with total freedom have become a cesspoll in a private toilet, with no proper education about the pain of Ego sharing. How husband+wife AMOR Love can be stronger than parent+child or peer friendships.  Leo B. and Troubadours</li>
+		<li>The poison impact of Edward Bernays techniques on education  our societies. From cradle to grave, this teaching system is negatively impacting interpersonal relationships and lifestyles.</li>
+		<li>Easter Sunday 1929 and Edward Bernays - and the resulting year 2015 cancer, obeseity, family communications problems (team factions of fast food and consumptive living), and division of wealthy and poor in the USA and now globally. Removing <i>Eye of Reason</i> as the principal of peer to peer Democracy and Education.</li>
+		<li>Teaching techniques focused on sterile classrooms - and the cultural attacks against the 1960's Peace Movemeents and Love + Compasssion + Music (excessive anti-society copyright and patents) and how these teaching techniques impact the students, such as Richard Feynman said about Brazil Physics students</li>
+		<li>The horrible teaching of our modern Church/Temple/Mosques to fight (and disagree) against each other.  Even internal factions such as Protestant vs. Catholic / Sunni vs. Shia - ignoring  جلال‌الدین محمد رومی, James Joyce and Joseph Campbell's (and many other individuals) unified theories.
+		Further, the latest modern use of the word "Love" as a consumable by McDonald's, Suabaru, Starbucks, etc. (hundreds of examples on youtube, etc). Such low views of "Love" and "Religion" remove important concepts of Eternity, Forgiveness, etc.</li>
+		<li>Public infrastructure of the world, in a GPL fashion like Richard Stallman. Democratic election machines, democratic passports, democratic tax systems, etc.</li>
+		<li>The failure of modern Pysche medical science to account for the work of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung - and to take a Freud Socratic Path.  Systemic insulting Hippies and religions Peace people (Martin Luther King Jr, Leo F. Buscaglia) as "crazy" and "extremeist".
+			Leo F. Buscaglia specifically spoke in Sacramento, California PBS 1980 about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opGlp1pE59s">being called "crazy"</a> during my childhood.</li>
+		<li>The metaphors of a Society Mythology (religion) as a Computer Operating System (protected mode) and seams where violence and hate appear and how such negatives can be improved / reduced</li>
+		<li>Society (Socratic science) failure to recognize that Autism existed before the 1950's and how it is treated differenty by each culture on the Earth. Further, the obsession over children and not considering the adults with Autism.</li>
+		<li>How World News is not free to All people on an Internet Wikipedia type system - and instead has become Edward Bernays propeganda and contantly uses fear and terror of car accidents, shootouts, other nations, etc.  How this poisons both Founding Father's Eye of Reason and all global Democratic ideals.  The focus on profits and large corporate ownership of news ("the press") has made everyday conversations full of greed-driven misinforation and terrorists controlling the majority.</li>
+		<li>How youth no longer backpack and travel as part of their education, instead sit behind computer desks and stare into their iPhone - and are angry and hateful toward the world - and how things like Global Climate Change are ignored while the comparatively established sit in air conditioned comfort - lacking compassion even close to home - such as the "War on Drugs" against Mexico (society "Love thy Neighbor", "Eye of Reason" education).</li>
+		<li>How almost all our artists are profit-seeking fame-seeking sellouts making deals with massive profit corporate music sellers like Apple Computers. Even Michael Jackson, as criticized by Tom Waits. The Regean "War on Drugs" was a modern day Prohibition against Hippies.  I never even used these drugs, but I see the murder and violence this created by declaring "War" on people's learning of their own minds through often peaceful drugs, art, music, etc.  That Detroit and New Orleans, America's music roots of Jazz and Motown - are in such ruins in year 2015 shows the war is right at home.
+		Austin art has expanded in many directions of artists who only travel if paid to do so and for Facebook Likes and publicity photos (why is Austin not one  of the first places to legalize Pot?) - not like Detroit or New Orleans used to be before "Drug Wars" and person-to-person backpacking travel were systemtically de-emphasized by educators. <i>Keep Austin Wierd</i> got mostly paved over, and Public Transit ignored in favor of iPhone bubbles on wheels. Edward Bernays seems to be our educator of youth today, given the high-value cars in the parking lots I see at the year 2015 university - and fashion backpacks.</li>
+		<li>The failure of the United States of America to establish an electronic peer to peer payment/currency system to facilitate small business and artists directly. Eye of Reason, peer to peer, failure in service to monolitic coporations, corrupt politicians, and corrupt lawyers.</li>
+	</ol>
+
+Why is it in year 2015 we consider ourselves so educated when we keep overlooking all these things our artists are saying? We dance to songs, but do not listen to their lyrics. Too many of us are blind in the *Eye of Reason*, being MasterMan and not being a total human.
+
+<h2>Reference Art - Music Songs</h2>
+
+To me, personally inward, it is important to pay attention to the decades these artists have been ignored. The years the songs were published and entered into the society "Public Dream" (Carl Jung terminology). The poems are complex and fit with Campbell's definition of Sublime art (in his review of art in <em>The Inner Reaches of Outer Space</em>).  They are not movtivated by money as much as the more popular, and speak Troubadour Year 1210 Truth against society corruption:
+
+	<ol>
+		<li>SuperTramp: Logical Song, Dreamer</li>
+		<li>Steely Dan: Only a Fool Would Say That, Time out of Mind, Any World (That I'm Welcome To), [<i>Wheel of Becoming</i> topic:] Do It Again</li>
+		<li>Yes: Hearts</li>
+		<li>Sting: If I Ever Lose My Faith In You [focus on "you" meaning all peers, persons - not "you" the smaller romantic viewpoint]</li>
+		<li>Pink Floyd: Wish You Were Here</li>
+		<li>Styx: Crystal Ball, The Grand Illusion, [<i>Eye of Reason</i> topic:] Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man), [Male Autism topic, dehumanization topic:] Mr. Roboto</li>
+		<li>John Lennon: Imagine</li>
+	</ol>
+

+Don't really want Chapters on the same HTML page, but doing it now for sake of backup ease.
+<p />
+Now, before we get started, put all those quotes out in front of you and keep them in your mind and in your view.  Spiral into content. "Eye of Reason" as defined by Campbell, "Pale Blue Dot" as defined by Carl Segan.  Dance!

+
+<h2>Chapter 1: Oceans</h2>
+
+As I stood on the beach in Bali Indonesia on New Years Eve, after exiting the beautiful modern shopping mall - having just then seen the terrible New Hobbit movie - I saw thousands and thousands of people preparing for an evening of individual rocket launches.
+Indonesia has the most liberal visa policies I have encountered in the world, despite my personal conflict with the border guard, the resulting gathering of people showed just how flexible and dynamic - how alive - this society was.  The motorbike crowded streets were insane in regard to human safety, but full of adventure and zeal.
+<p />
+As I sat there, with the ocean waves lapping against my heart - something stirred deeper and deeper inside me.  I had lived next to the ocean for 12 months in Arica, Chile - and watched the waves from my beautiful hilltop appartment - and the kind and loving families who had welcomed my now ex-wife and I into that society.  But here on New Years Eve in Bali - something really was going on inside me.  Here I was... having the same marriage conflicts in a second marriage, my partner unable to communicate deeply with me nor understand me.
+And I started to sense that more New Years were coming, that I had seen a calendar suggesting China had one, and I was already a Sufi Muslim - and knew that that was a third New Years.  And the ocean tides, moved by the Orbiting Satellite like clockwork - and even the joyful rainfalls every afternoon in Summer New Year of Bali.  I was far from my December Winter of midwestern North America youth that Bob Seger sings of in <em>Roll Me Away</em>.
+<p />
+Was I reacting to my education? Albert Einstein's e=mc^2 equation did not take into account his own Jewish education. He did not look at religion as biologically grounded as Joseph Campbell, Carl Jung and many others had.  That the human brain itself was a processing machine, and could reveal hints of the black holes and big bang of our own universe.  That our odd social behaviors, rituals, and even our wedding ceremonies can provide hints of what aspects of <i>uncertainty</i> that were missing from his mathmatics equation. 
+<p />
+Paul Simon's song <em>50 ways to leave your lover</em> - was perhaps recalled to me (having experienced it at the shores of the Gulf of Mexico on at the NOLA Jazz Festival), the beauty of this song - I now call a Siloutee of Love (in many art forms) - how easy it is to destroy in the universe, but not how hard it is to create.  How e=mc^2 is a lopsided equation.  Dark Matter - 50 ways to leave your universe - and how many ways to Big Bang it?  This is how The Little Prince works, the abscence, the lonliness, the isolation, the missing community - it speaks to All.  Here I was, in Bali - with rocket launches by Everyone.  A Christmas tree in a mixed Hindu Muslim society right behind me in that shopping mall.
+<p />
+Within weeks of that Bali New Years Eve, I was describing to my marriage partner - drawing on the glass wall of a shower that divided us - by drawing waves - that my own body hormones impacted my mental behavior. That I felt religion and biology - the prayer movemenets of Islam and even the calendar of Ramadan were interlinked to the black holes that spin our Star Solaris and our Moon.  I was using metaphors without full realization of how deep these connections really are inside our human brain.  My subconsious computer was crunching away at my education trying to make sense of a Socratic Logic when the world is not binary nor Socratic.
+<p />
+<p />
+Hey, it's early writing ;)  I just pour it on page, in overlapping waves, dupe and mixed, and then try to sort it out.

+			Timothy Leary; Changing My Mind, Among Others : Lifetime Writings (1982), p. 76; To describe externals, you become a scientist. To describe experience, you become an artist. The old distinction between artists and scientists must vanish. Every time we teach a child correct usage of an external symbol, we must spend as much time teaching him how to fission and reassemble external grammar to communicate the internal. The training of artists and creative performers can be a straightforward, almost mechanical process. When you teach someone how to perform creatively (ie, associate dead symbols in new combinations), you expand his potential for experiencing more widely and richly.

The problem is that no one is giving them anything fresh. They've got a brain dressed up with nowhere to go."

+			Timothy Leary; The Psychedelic Experience (1964), p. 12; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of death, during an intermediate phase lasting forty-nine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their mystical teachings. … The esoteric meaning, as it has been interpreted in this manual, <span class="quoteH0">is that it is death and rebirth of the ego that is described</span>, not of the body. Lama Govinda indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The book's esoteric <span class="quoteH0">meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism</span>. It was not intended for general reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the pre-mortem-death-rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm.&quot;</span>

You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal people” as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like “Have a nice day” and “Weather’s awful today, eh?”, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like “Tell me something that makes you cry” or “What do you think deja vu is for?”. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing? Who knows what you might learn from taking a chance on conversation with a stranger? Everyone carries a piece of the puzzle. Nobody comes into your life by mere coincidence. Trust your instincts.

 	I think by now, it is obvious: I find myself like, Stephan A. Hoeller (born in Budapest, Hungary), who declared in this free <a href="http://www.gnosis.org/CJ44.ram">Free Audio Lecture about Campbell</a> - agreeing with almost everything Campbell said about the modern world viewpoints of religion and philosophy. Anyway, a lot of these quotes will be the basis of my own person life experience and book chapters I intend to author.

+The cross-culture marriage of John Lennon + Yoko Ono spawned the formalization of the Artistic Ideal of “Bagism”.  However, the idea is not new in Artistic poetry and can also be witnessed in Plato's Allegory of the Cave.  Perhaps most dramatic in the work of the (unknown person) of Williman Shakespeare, notably Hamlet has these key concepts:
+
+1. The opening scene has the King in plain soldier clothing. This is “Bagism” in the sense of a perspective of listening to a talented person (Hamlet) and not being so formal and over-impressed with Power and Fame. This is precisely what John Lennon + Yoko Ono were telling their audience and fans.
+2. Shakespeare's use of “Play within a Play” as an abstraction tool – to distance one self from the beauty and personality of the actors. Look at Film vs. Theater – and how your local community college can perform Hamlet in revealing ways – without the anti-Bagism concern for the direct beauty and voice of the actor.
+3. Hamlet's famous “crazy scenes” (“spirit, ghost”) are exactly as Joseph Campbell would describe a metaphysical observer perspective of LIfe – here is Shakespeare expressing the very way an artist uses his own brain to create art. The observations, the “Eye of Reason” or the Troubadour higher viewpoint. He was educating people on what it was like – and what it seemed like from a outside perspective (“crazy, irrational”).  Again, much like Plato's telling of the Allegory of the Cave and the difficulty we have going mind to mind, person to person with our deepest most realizations and experiences.  As Campbell would say, Carl Jung would encourage depersonalization – an internal type of Bagism.
+
+Taken forward, Banksy is a walking example of modern artistic Bagism – criticizing the society directly for their listening skills and distraction by modern marketing, advertising, and similar by the wealthy and elite.
+
+Look at the modern conflicts of Mohammad cartoons. Mohammad was saying the same themes as Bagism – to not idolize and concern with the Fame and Person of the speaker – Mohammad and other teachers - but to focus on the message – the understanding of an abstract God (Allah) himself as it relates to the living persons around you.  Peer to peer focus, not a hierarchical focus on just Mohammad's life.  This is very much a Sufi interpretation of Islam, the recommendation to not have images of the speaker inside the house to worship, etc. Nor to go to the grave site and to treat this teacher as a non-human instructor.  This was John Lennon + Yoko Ono's point.  This is not defending violence, let me clearly state – all violence is negative. However, it's important to see the source of the strong negative emotions – which John Lennon and Yoko Ono were illustrating in a kind and nice fashion.  Art is Art, Truth is Truth, and John Lennon's Bagism education / his coining of the modern term – can be transferred to the Muslim Cartoon conflicts. Alas, many modern followers of Islam have perhaps failed to see that a non-believer is not worshiping the image of Mohammad – so it presents no risk to their personal inward belief. Mohammad's focus was that you, the worshiper, do not regard the image with emotion (be it violence or idolatry).

From a (counter-)cultural point of view, they seem to be complete opposites. The hippies, for example, saw psychedelics as an antidote to technology which stereotypes our consciousness and desensitizes our perception. In the 60s, Leary himself was very much against computers. He saw them as devices that would merely increase the dependence of individuals on experts. As Leary put it: \u8220\'81\'67[A]t that time, computers were mainframes that cost millions of dollars and were owned by Bell Telephone company, IBM, CIA, Department of Motor Vehicles \uc1 \u8211\'3f no friends of mine!

+In the early 80s, however, when thanks to smaller size and cheaper prize computers became accessible to millions of people, Leary changed his attitude towards computers and realized that psychedelic drugs and computers actually have very much in common. He discovered that psychedelic drugs and personal computers \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67are simply two ways in which individuals have learned to take the power back from the state\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). Leary argues that both psychedelics and computers can help us to liberate ourselves from authority and \u8220\'81\'67create our own realities.\u8221\'81\'68 In the course of his long career as psychologist and counterculture philosopher Leary wrote more than thirty books (several of them more than  400 pages long) in which he offers us very elaborate theories - using concepts from the fields of psychology, neurobiology, ethology, quantum physics, cybernetics, and chaos theory - that explain how we can use psychedelic drugs and computers to escape the \u8220\'81\'67narrow reality tunnels\u8221\'81\'68 that authorities force us to live in and create our own individual realities whose limits are determined only by the limits of our imagination. \uc1 }

According to Leary, we have been programmed by our parents, politicians, priests, and teachers to think and see the world the way they want us to think and see the world. For example, they programmed us to think in terms of dominance and submission so that for us it seems normal that there are a few who have power and create the rules while all the others are submissive, law-abiding citizens. Leary makes us aware that the models of reality the authorities are imposing on us are not reflections of an objective reality; they are just arbitrary constructions.

Only if we are able to control our own nervous systems \uc1 \u8211\'3f which means that we know how our brains operate \u8211\'3f would we be able to change the realities we live in.

I want to compare Leary\u8217\'81\'66s earlier theories, in which he praises LSD as the key to cosmic consciousness and sweeping societal change, to his later theories, in which he praises the computer as a tool of liberation and transcendence. This comparison will help me to show that that the hippies and the cyberpunks \uc1 \u8211\'3f who, at first sight, seem to have nothing in common except the fact that they are both countercultures (i.e., counter to the leading culture) - have much more in common than one would think. I will argue that the cyberpunks and cyber-hippies were strongly influenced by the transcendentalist ideas that prevailed in the 60s counterculture. (Although it is indebted to ideas of recent vintage such as chaos theory, the cyber-hippies\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66 techno-transcendentalism owes much to the 60s counterculture \uc1 \u8211\'3f specifically, to the ideas of 60s-cult-authors like Leary or Marshall McLuhan.) Another thing we will see when we examine Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s theories is that the hippies were not nearly as rural and anti-technological as some cultural critics argue. According to Leary, the hippies and the cyberpunks/cyber-hippies share the same aim (individual freedom, ecstasy); only the technologies the cyberpunks use to reach this aim are different ones.\uc1 }

+There are several reasons why I decided to write this rather extensive paper on Leary: First of all, many cultural critics and media philosophers writing about countercultures (e.g., Theodore Roszak, Mark Dery, and Douglas Rushkoff) argue that Leary \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67exerted a significant influence on the youth culture of the 60s\u8221\'81\'68(Roszak 1995: 164) and portray him as a leading figure of the \u8220\'81\'67cyberdelic\u8221\'81\'68 (cybernetic-psychedelic) counterculture of the 90s (cf. Dery 1996: 22, cf. Rushkoff 1995: 49f.). None of them, however, gives a comprehensive overview of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theories which have influenced thousands of young people who read Leary\u8217\'81\'66s books. I decided to give such an overview because I want to show that Leary has more to offer than a few catchphrases (like \u8220\'81\'67turn on, tune in, drop out\u8221\'81\'68). Furthermore, I think that an overview of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s different theories can be very helpful to discover interesting connections between his early theories, in which he expresses the most important beliefs that prevailed in the apolitical wing of the 60s counterculture, and his later theories, which are a synthesis of the most important beliefs and ideas that prevail in the cyberdelic counterculture of the 90s.\uc1 }

+Another reason why I decided to write this paper on Leary is that in his theories Leary expresses a worldview that is becoming more and more important in science and philosophy, as well as in everyday life in our postmodern Information Society: the constructivist worldview. An old Talmudic saying perfectly describes this worldview in one single sentence: We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.

+Many constructivists focus their attention on the metaphysical issue of the nature of reality, trying to answer the question to what extent humans can learn about and experience reality, or, put another way, to what extent we create our realities. In general, they point to the role of the observer in any observations that are made of the \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67world.\u8221\'81\'68 The  quantum physicists (Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, et al) were the ones who, in the 1920s, introduced constructivist concepts to the world of physics. In contrast to Descartes and Newton who argued that the world is made up of a multitude of separate objects existing independently of the observer, the quantum physicists suggested that the universe is  \u8220\'81\'67a network of dynamic relationships that \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

Leary was very much  influenced by the ideas of Einstein and Heisenberg. In practically all of his books he discusses the philosophical implications of quantum theory.

+, for example, he offers us a very bold interpretation of quantum theory which he uses to back his idea that computers enable us to create our own realities which, according to Leary, are as real as the so called material reality. However, the method that helped Leary to discover that \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 is a construction of our minds was not quantum physics but psychedelics. Leary explains: \u8220\'81\'67Since psychedelic drugs expose us to different levels of perception, and experience, use of them is ultimately a philosophic enterprise, compelling us to confront the nature of reality and the nature of our fragile, subjective belief systems. The contrast is what triggers the laughter, the terror. We discover abruptly that we have been programmed all these years,  that everything we accepted as reality is just a social fabrication\u8221\'81\'68 (FB 33).\uc1 }

NP  45f.). In this paper, I want to make people  aware of the fact that several important figures of the cybermovement (e.g., R. U.

The first chapter is a short biography of Leary. I decided to include it because in my opinion we can never fully understand Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theories if we do not know anything about his background (how a sober, buttoned up psychologist became a drug guru of the 60s counterculture, etc).

His grandfather, Dr. Timothy Leary, after whom his father \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67Tote\u8221\'81\'68 and Timothy himself were named, was considered to be the richest Irish Catholic in western Massachusetts. He published works on blood circulation. The Learys were \u8220\'81\'67urban, urbane, well-to-do [...] sexy, funloving and selforiented\u8221\'81\'68  (FB 24-26). Leary\u8217\'81\'66s mother was also an Irish Catholic but she came from a different social scene. According to Leary, Abigail\u8217\'81\'66s side of the family was \u8220\'81\'67traditional, family oriented, suspicious of all things joyous, frivolous, or newfangled\u8221\'81\'68 (FB 26). Tote was \u8220\'81\'67contemptuous of those who worked for the system\u8221\'81\'68(FB 38). He practiced dentistry sporadically, as \u8220\'81\'67a gentlemanly hobby\u8221\'81\'68 (cf. FB 38). Timothy turned out to be a smart boy. At the age of ten, when he was reading eight to ten books a week, his grandfather gave him the advice: \u8220\'81\'67Never do anything like anyone else, boy [...] Find your own way\u8221\'81\'68 (FB 24).When Timothy was fourteen his alcoholic father left the family, because he was disappointed about the fact that the inheritance from his father was just a few thousand dollars.\uc1 }

+After High School Timothy went to Holy Cross, a Jesuit college. He left Holy Cross after about one year, because he was accepted at the military academy West Point. After dropping out of West Point, because he committed a rules infraction, Leary became a psychology major at the University of Alabama. It didn\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66t take long, however, until he was expelled from university for sleeping over at the girl\u8217\'81\'66s dormitory, which was in 1942 (cf. FB 137). Leary\u8217\'81\'66s draft deferment was cancelled, so he was drafted. Since the army needed psychologists they let Leary finish his degree in the service. In 1944, Leary met Mariannne (?), an audio technician. They married the same year and had two children, Susan and Jack. Leary received his master\u8217\'81\'66s degree in psychology at Washington State University. His thesis was a statistical study of the dimensions of intelligence (Leary 1946). Leary and Marianne moved to Berkeley. Leary earned a doctorate in psychology from the University of California Berkeley (Leary 1950), and over the next few years conducted research in psychotherapy. By the 50s he was teaching at Berkeley and had been appointed Director of Psychological Research at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland (cf. FB 16).

Psychology still had not developed a way of significantly and predictably changing human behavior. Leary\u8217\'81\'66s studies showed that one third of the patients who received psychotherapy got better, one third got worse and one third stayed  the same. Together with Susan and Jack, Leary moved to Florence, Italy. In spring 1960, Leary got a teaching post at Harvard University, Massachusetts, because the Director of the Harvard Center of Personality Research, McClelland, considered Leary\u8217\'81\'66s revolutionary approach to psychotherapy to be the future of American Psychology. Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theory on existential transaction (Leary 1960) suggested that the whole relationship between patient and therapists should be changed to a more egalitarian information exchange.\uc1 }

+Leary did not follow the medical model of Behaviorism, which is the model of giving drugs to others and then observing the external results. His idea was that the scientist first should teach him-/herself how to use the drug and then take it together with the \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67patient.\u8221\'81\'68 Furthermore, Leary was not out to discover new laws, which is to say, to discover the redundant implications of his own premises. This approach, which is the approach of Humanistic Psychology, was considered to be unscientific by many psychologists at that time. Leary also felt that the term \u8220\'81\'67psychotomimetic\u8221\'81\'68 (which means \u8220\'81\'67mimicking psychosis\u8221\'81\'68), which was used in psychology of that time to describe the effects of hallucinogenic drugs, was inadequate, because it reflected a negative, pathological orientation and did not include concepts of enriching the mind and enlarging the vision. He used the term \u8220\'81\'67psychedelic,\u8221\'81\'68 meaning \u8220\'81\'67mind-manifesting,\u8221\'81\'68 instead (cf. Lee 1992: 55). Leary\u8217\'81\'66s experiments had interesting results. For example, in one of his formal experiments Leary was able to show that psychedelic drugs can produce deep religious experiences similar to those reported by prophets and mystics throughout the ages (cf. PE 15f.).\uc1 }

+Celebrities such as writers Aldous Huxley and Allen Ginsberg took part in Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s experiments. In addition to the formal studies Leary carried out at Harvard, Leary also held psychedelic sessions in his private apartment. In December 1960, Ginsberg came for a visit. Leary and Ginsberg took psilocybin together. While under the influence of the drug, Ginsberg had a vision: \u8220\'81\'67I\u8217\'81\'66m the messiah. I\u8217\'81\'66ve come down to preach love to the world. We are going to teach people to stop hating\u8221\'81\'68(FB 48f). During the experience Ginsberg became convinced, that psychedelic drugs held the promise of changing mankind, curing sick society. His plan was that everybody should take mind-expanding drugs. Ginsberg\u8217\'81\'66s vision struck a chord in Leary. From then on, Leary saw himself as the messiah whose mission was to enlighten the whole world with psychedelic drugs. Leary believed that political problems were manifestations of psychological problems, which at the bottom were neurological-chemical (cf. FB 50). Together with Ginsberg, Leary started turning on the Beat poets Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, Charles Olson, and William Burroughs to psylocibin (cf. FB 49-52, cf. Lee 1992: 80).\uc1 }

+It was Michael Hollingshead, a British philosophy student, who gave LSD to Leary (cf. FB 117). LSD is a synthetic psychedelic - first synthesized by Albert Hofmann, a Swiss scientist, in 1938, while seeking for a pain killer for migraine headaches (cf. Hofmann 1980) \u8211\'3f which is even stronger than psilocybin. When Leary took LSD he experienced the most shattering experience of his life: \uc2 \u8221\'81\'68Pilocybin had sucked me down into nerve nets, into body organs,[...] had let me spiral down the DNA ladder of evolution to the beginning of life on this planet. But LSD was something different [...it] had flipped my consciousness into a dance of energy, where nothing existed except whirring vibrations and each illusory form was simply a different frequency\u8221\'81\'68(FB 118). From then on, Leary used LSD in his research. With the help of  LSD he wanted to get insight into the mechanisms of the brain. He also wanted to develop a language, verbal as well as non-verbal, that makes us able to talk about drug experiences in a scientific way.\uc1 }

After the \u8220\'81\'67Harvard scandal\u8221\'81\'68 most major US magazines featured stories about Leary and LSD, so Leary was suddenly known all over the US as \u8220\'81\'67Mr. LSD\u8221\'81\'68(cf. Lee 1992: 88). During their time at Harvard Leary and Alpert had also started a private drug research project, the International Foundation of Internal Freedom (IFIF), which they continued after their expulsion (cf. Lee 1992: 96). The aim of the project was to study the religious use of psychedelics. It did not take long until the organization counted 3000 due-paying members. Offices were set up all across America. In  the summer of 1963, the headquaters of the organization were moved to a hotel in Zihuatanejo, Mexico. A group of Beatniks and bohemians followed Leary to Mexico, but were not allowed to participate in the research programs. It only took six weeks until the IFIF was expelled from Mexico (cf. Lee 1992, 97). \uc1 }

+A rich stockbroker, Bill Hitchcock, was very interested in the IFIF\uc2 \u180\'81\'4cs work, so he offered Leary and Alpert that they could use his mansion in Millbrook, New York, as a place where they could do their research. Leary and Alpert accepted the offer. A core group of about 30 people gathered at Millbrook. IFIF was disbanded and replaced by another organization, the Castilian Foundation (named after an intellectual colony in Hesse\u180\'81\'4cs \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

To name a few, there was the Jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson, psychiatrists Humphry Osmond and R. D. Laing, the philosopher Alan Watts, and also a Swedish model named Nina Schlebrugge. In 1964, Leary married Nina Schlebrugge (cf. Lee 1992, 102). However, their relationship did not last long. They parted soon after their honeymoon in India. \uc1 }

+Inspired by the media philosopher Marshall McLuhan, Leary started using the media, trying to change the negative associations that people had when they heard the word \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67LSD\u8221\'81\'68 into positive ones. He promised LSD users beauty, philosophic wonder, religious revelation, increased intelligence, mystical romance, and better sex (cf. FB 251). It was at that time that Leary came up with the slogan \u8220\'81\'67Turn On \uc1 \u8211\'3f Tune In \u8211\'3f Drop Out\uc2 \u8221\'81\'68. \u8220\'81\'67Turn On\u8221\'81\'68 meant to go within, with the help of psychedelics, meditation or other methods. It meant to become sensitive to the many levels of consciousness one can reach. \u8220\'81\'67Tune In\u8221\'81\'68 meant to interact harmoniously with the world one is surrounded by, to express one\u8217\'81\'66s new internal perspectives. \u8220\'81\'67Drop Out\u8221\'81\'68 suggested an active process of detachment from involuntary and unconscious commitments (cf. FB 253). What he wanted to express with his slogan is that psychedelics (especially LSD) create a \u8220\'81\'67new consciousness\u8221\'81\'68 and teach you to reject repressive politics, war, violence, military service, racism, erotic hypocrisy, sexism, and established religion (cf. Leary 1995: 8). In 1966, LSD became illegal. For Leary, the criminalization of LSD meant that psychedelics and what he called \u8220\'81\'67new consciousness\u8221\'81\'68 became a political issue indissolubly intertwined with peace, sexual liberation, \u8220\'81\'67end the draft\u8221\'81\'68, ecology, etc(cf. Leary 1995: 9). In 1968, when the 60s revolution reached its peak , Tim became active socially as an anti- Vietnam protester, sang \u8220\'81\'67Give peace a chance\u8221\'81\'68 with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and announced his candidacy for governor of California in March 1970 (cf.

He proclaimed that \u8220\'81\'67the personal computer is the LSD of the 90s,\u8221\'81\'68 empowering people on a mass level (cf. CC  coverpage). Leary became a spokesman for a new high-tech subculture, the \u8220\'81\'67cyberpunks.\u8221\'81\'68 Furthermore, he started his own software company, Futique Inc., which designs programs that \u8220\'81\'67digitize thought-images,\u8221\'81\'68 produces \u8220\'81\'67cyberwear\u8221\'81\'68 for virtual reality (TV goggles and quadrophonic sound systems that immerse the user in 3-D computer-graphic worlds)  and develops educational software for students (cf.

+Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s work, especially the theory about human consciousness he developed in the early 60s, was very much influenced by Eastern philosophies and religions. In his spiritual approach to psychedelic experiences Leary felt affirmed by the discovery of ancient Asian spiritual texts. Ancient Asian spiritual texts are concerned with transcendence, with learning to go beyond the ego-centered perspectives of ordinary human consciousness, beyond the dualities of right and wrong, beyond space and time, and with becoming liberated from the cravings and fears that characterize human existence. For Buddhists, Hinduists, and Taoists, the method of attaining such liberating transcendence was not psychedelics but meditation. However, Leary was convinced that their goal was essentially the same as that of spiritually oriented psychedelic explorers. Leary translated two of the ancient texts, the Buddhist text \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

There are seven levels in the Buddhist text, five levels in the Taoist text. Both texts are concerned with giving up the supremacy of the \u8220\'81\'67egohood\u8221\'81\'68 and entering a mystical state of illumination which goes beyond form, that is, beyond words and \u8220\'81\'67hallucinatory struggles.\u8221\'81\'68 Leary used these translations as guide books for his psychedelic sessions.\uc1 }

+, which can help us to increase our intelligence, creativity, sexual pleasures, philosophical insight, to abolish authoritarian dogmatic social structures, and to speed up the evolution of humankind in general. On the basis of his drug experiments at Harvard and personal experiences with the psychedelic drugs LSD and psilocybin, Leary built an all-encompassing theory about human consciousness, which is a synthesis of eastern philosophy and western science and gives answers to basic questions of philosophy, psychology, politics and religion. (Leary was not the first person who tried to create such a synthesis. For example, there were William James, C.G. Jung, and writer and early psychedelic explorer Aldous Huxley who  tried to create a synthesis between eastern and western thinking.) In Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s opinion ancient eastern texts on the nature of consciousness were helpful but they were only very vague descriptions of the unknown \u8220\'81\'67phenomenological territories\u8221\'81\'68 Leary wanted to explore. Leary thought that he had found a language that was more adequate to describe psychedelic experiences and the nature of human consciousness. The language Leary uses in his Theory of the Seven Levels of Consciousness is a mixture of scientific vocabulary, mystical terms used in eastern philosophical and religious texts, and psychedelic slang.\uc1 }

+The first formal experiment conducted by Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s group was a rehabilitation program carried out at the Massachusetts Correctional Institute in Concord, a maximum security prison. The inmates were given (synthetic) psilocybin to find out whether the drug would help prisoners change their ways, thereby lowering the recidivism rate. They formed groups and at least one member of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s group took psilocybin with the prisoners. Part of the project was designed to help ex-inmates (only those who received the drug) get integrated into society again after their release. The study proved successful in the short term, only 25% of those who took the drug ended up in prison again, as compared to the normal return-rate of about 80% (cf. Lee 1992: 75; cf. FB 102). \uc1 }

+The other experiment, which was conducted by Walter Pahnke as part of his Ph.D. dissertation for Harvard Divinity School, dealt with the relationship between drug-induced and naturally occurring religious experiences. In this experiment Pahnke sought to determine, whether the transcendent experiences reported during psychedelic sessions were similar to the mystical experiences described in various holy scriptures and reported by prophets throughout the ages. Pills, half of them containing psilocybin and half of them being placebos, were given to theology students at a Good Friday service. Neither the test subjects nor Leary and Pahnke knew who had received the drug and who had not. The results showed that the participants who took the psilocybin pill had significantly deeper mystical religious experiences than the ones who received placebos in the same situation. Leary concluded that a mystical experience could be produced chemically by those who sought it, provided that \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67set\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67setting\u8221\'81\'68 are appropriate (cf. FB 108). (\u8220\'81\'67Set\u8221\'81\'68 is the character structure and attitudinal predisposition. In this case it means being religiously motivated. By reading books on psychedelic experiences and protocols written by other subjects the divinity students prepared themselves for the drug experience. \u8220\'81\'67Setting\u8221\'81\'68 is the immediate situation; in this case: a Good Friday service.) \uc1 }

+After formulating these questions, Leary explains that the purpose of life is religious discovery, which, for him, means to answer these questions and also experience the answers. However, Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s concept of religion, as we will see, is totally different from the rigid hierarchical dogmatic religious systems of Catholicism, Protestantism or any kind of fundamentalism. Leary makes the reader aware that one important fact about these questions is that not only the religions of the world give answers to these questions, the data of natural sciences do so as well. He compares answers given by science with the experiences described by his test subjects and finds striking similarities. Let me give one of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s examples: What is the scientific answer to the first question? Leary explains that  Nuclear physicists, for example, suggest that the basic energy underlying the universe is located within the nucleus. \u8220\'81\'67The nucleus radiates a powerful electrical field which holds and controls the electrons around it.[...] Objects, which on the macroscopic level seem to be solid, are actually a transparent sphere of emptiness, thinly populated with whirling electrons\u8221\'81\'68 (PE 22). Leary points out that psychedelic reports often contain phrases which seem to describe similar phenomena, subjectively experienced: \u8220\'81\'67I felt open to a total flow, over and around and through my body[...] All objects were dripping, streaming, with white hot light of electricity which flowed in the air [...]\u8221\'81\'68(PE 23). He comes to the conclusion that \u8220\'81\'67those aspects of the psychedelic experience which subjects report to be ineffable and ecstatically religious involve a direct awareness of the energy process which physicists and biochemists and physiologists and neurologists and psychologists and psychiatrists measure\u8221\'81\'68 (PE 21).\uc1 }

+Based on this conclusion, Leary builds his theory about human consciousness. The basic assumption of this theory is that consciousness is based on physical structure. Leary sees }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5
+consciousness as a biochemical process}{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5
+ (cf. PE 339). He also equates consciousness with energy: \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67Consciousness is energy received and decoded by structure\u8221\'81\'68 (PE 342). According to Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theory, there are as many levels of consciousness in the human body as there are anatomical structures to receive and decode energy. Leary suggests that there are seven levels of consciousness. These seven levels correspond to the seven questions. (I will explain the seven levels and their correlation to anatomical structures further below.) And now comes the crucial point in Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theory. Since, according to Leary, consciousness is a biochemical process Leary concludes that the \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

+consciousness is also chemical}{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5
+. He suggests that there are specific drugs to \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67turn on\u8221\'81\'68 each of the seven levels. Most people would not be capable of reaching the higher levels of consciousness (levels 1-4) and having religious experiences, except with the help of psychedelic drugs. Leary admits that there are other ancient methods, like meditation, which can help us to reach higher levels of consciousness, but \u8220\'81\'67at present time, man is so sick, that only a few people can use ancient methods, so that it is safe to say that drugs are the specific, and almost the only, way that the American is ever going to have a religious experience\u8221\'81\'68 (PE 297). Leary  predicts that \u8220\'81\'67psychedelics are the future of mankind,\u8221\'81\'68 that psychedelics will be the religion of the twenty first century and that during the next few hundred years the major activity of man will be the scientific exploration of our consciousness (i.e., our nervous system) with psychedelic drugs (cf. PE 346). In his Theory of the Seven Levels of Consciousness, he gives his view of how the future of mankind is going to look like. Now, what are these seven levels of consciousness? Which drug \u8220\'81\'67turns on\u8221\'81\'68 which level? And why exactly are most people not capable of reaching the higher levels?\uc1 }

+Before I describe the seven levels, I want to make a short comment on Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s style: Leary\u8217\'81\'66s language is very euphoric, agitating, poetic, and transcends standard \u8220\'81\'67either/or\u8221\'81\'68 logic (Eastern Philosophy does so as well). Leary mixes Buddhist and Hinduist metaphors with accurate scientific descriptions of biological, neurological, psychological and physical processes. Another thing that should be mentioned here to avoid confusion is that, according to Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Theory of the Seven Levels of Consciousness, \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 is a construction of our nervous system. Leary argues that a certain model of reality is imprinted in our nervous systems in childhood, and this model (or \u8220\'81\'67neural program\u8221\'81\'68)  determines what we will \u8220\'81\'67see\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67not see.\u8221\'81\'68 In most people the programs (imprints) they use to process information from the outside world remain the same for their whole life. If we took psychedelics, however, we would be able to suspend imprints, experience other realities (different levels of consciousness) and create our own realities. \uc1 }

+This is the lowest level. It is a state of anesthesia which can be produced by narcotics, barbiturates (sleeping pills) and large doses of alcohol. Typical examples for people living on this level of (un-)consciousness are heroin addicts and alcoholics who want to escape the existential pressure of being. Leary notes that he can very well understand these people  who want to escape the ego that narrows down our perception and escape all the social games of our society \u8211\'3fhe even calls them \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67deeply religious\u8221\'81\'68 -, but their attempts to escape the ego are futile because \u8220\'81\'67you just can\u8217\'81\'66t keep holding the \u8216\'81\'65off\u8217\'81\'66 switch\u8221\'81\'68(PE 43). The question (in Leary\u8217\'81\'66s list of seven questions) that corresponds to this level is the Ultimate Escape question: How do I get out of it (life)? Or you could also ask: When does it (life) end? Leary\u8217\'81\'66s answer is that life never ends. Science tells us that life is an ongoing process of being born and dying. According to Leary, it is only during a psychedelic experience that we learn that actually there is no death, there is nothing to fear. Leary suggests that we should \u8220\'81\'67go with the flow\u8221\'81\'68 of life, because stability is an illusion; everything is changing all the time (this concept can be found in Buddhism as well). \uc1 }

+This state of consciousness is dominated by the ego and the mind, the seat of thinking and reasoning. According to Leary, the most important reason why most of us cannot reach higher levels of consciousness is that we cannot escape the narrow \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67reality tunnel\u8221\'81\'68 of the ego, which is formed by what we have been told by our parents, educational institutions and governmental agencies. The ego is always socially defined. \u8220\'81\'67Social reality\u8221\'81\'68 is a neural program (cf. PE 35). (As I have already mentioned, Leary argues that a certain model of reality is imprinted in our nervous system during childhood which determines how we see the world.) We are told what we are and we accept what we are told. We are conditioned  to see, hear, smell, and to behave in a certain way. Psychological censoring-mechanisms (imprinting and conditioning) have made us \u8220\'81\'67blind Pavlovian dogs\u8221\'81\'68 who do whatever our rulers want us to do. We can not use our senses in a free, direct way. We see the world through the categories we have been taught to use. Sensory conditioning has forced us to accept a \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 which is \u8220\'81\'67a comic-tragic farce illusion\u8221\'81\'68(cf. PE 33). \uc1 }

Leary\u8217\'81\'66s aim has always been to de-politicize young people. \u8220\'81\'67People should not be allowed to talk politics,\u8221\'81\'68 he states, \u8220\'81\'67except on all fours\u8221\'81\'68(Lee 1992: 166). Revolution would be important but \u8220\'81\'67Revolution without Revelation is Tyranny\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67Revelation without Revolution is Slavery\u8221\'81\'68(Leary 1988: 16), as Leary had learned from the teachings of the mystic George Gurdjeff. For Leary,  the only revolution that can be successful is a revolution of the mind because the \u8220\'81\'67world\u8221\'81\'68 is a creation of our minds. \uc1 }

+In order to understand Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s impact on the youth culture and politics in the 60s we have to be aware that in the 60s the use of psychedelics and politics were strongly linked. Many historians writing about the 60s avoid any discussion of psychedelics without which the 60s, as we know them, would never have occurred. It should be remembered that in the 60s most of the political activism was connected, directly or indirectly, to the ingestion of psychedelics and therefore was shaped by ecstatic states of being. Michael Rossmann, a veteran of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement (this radical left wing student organization arose on the Berkeley campus in the fall of 1964 and protested for civil rights, disarmament, university reform, and so forth) perfectly described this connection between psychedelics and politics when he said: \u8220\'81\'67When a young person took his first puff of psychoactive smoke, he also drew in the psychoactive culture as a whole, the entire matrix of law and association surrounding the drug, its induction and transaction. One inhaled a certain way of dressing, talking, acting, certain attitudes. One became a youth criminal [sic] against the state\u8221\'81\'68 (Lee 1992: 129).

Stafford 1992: 54). \uc1 }

+What is the difference between Leary and the other promoters of psychedelics? If we compare Leary to novelist Ken Kesey who also \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67turned on\u8221\'81\'68 a lot of people (see Wolfe 1969), there is one big difference. In contrast to Ken Kesey, whose notorious \u8220\'81\'67acid tests\u8221\'81\'68 were supposed to be only fun and games - Kesey would put LSD in people\u8217\'81\'66s drinks and  without knowing that their drinks were laced with LSD people would drink it -, Leary told the young generation that getting turned on was not just a childish game but \u8220\'81\'67the sacred rite of a new age\u8221\'81\'68(ibid. 166). For Leary, the psychedelic movement was a religious movement. Leary managed to embed the younger generation\u8217\'81\'66s psychedelic fascination in a religious context. For many young people Leary\u8217\'81\'66s ideas were attractive because they were looking for something to believe in anyway and it was considered to be \u8220\'81\'67hip\u8221\'81\'68 to take drugs too. \uc1 }

Leary was just in time with his LSD campaign because the younger generation was ready to break out of the conservative, materialistic, and complacent world of their parents anyway. When, in 1964, the US got involved in the Vietnam war this was just one more reason for people to join Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s side.

For Ginsberg, Leary was one of the few people in our century who kept up the tradition of the \u8220\'81\'67new consciousness\u8221\'81\'68 which, according to Ginsberg, can be traced back through old gnostic texts, visions, artists, and shamans (cf. Leary 1995 Foreword by Ginsberg). Even William Burroughs who initially was skeptical about Leary\u8217\'81\'66s \u8220\'81\'67save-the-world antics\u8221\'81\'68 later came to regard Leary as a \u8220\'81\'67true pioneer of human evolution\u8221\'81\'68(cf.

+After Leary had been dismissed from Harvard, students from various universities throughout the US paid him to give lectures at their universities. Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s organizations for spiritual discovery (IFIF, Castilia Foundation, L.S.D.) and also his \u8220\'81\'67psychedelic celebrations\u8221\'81\'68 - featuring re-enactments of the lives of Buddha, Christ, Mohammed and light shows which were designed to produce an \u8220\'81\'67acid trip\u8221\'81\'68 without drugs - were enjoying much success. Various Rock groups, for example the Beatles, were using passages from Leary\u8217\'81\'66s books as lyrics for their songs (cf. Lee 1992: 181). At the first Human Be-In in San Francisco in January 1967 Leary\u8217\'81\'66s speech was the highlight of the afternoon (cf. Lee 1992: 161). Many people of the radical and hip scene that developed in the Haight Ashbury district in San Francisco in the early 60s, the hippies, and even members of the New Left accepted as gospel every word Leary uttered (cf. ibid.). \uc1 }

+The US government was against the use of psychedelic drugs in general. The consumption of  these drugs was considered to be morally wrong and dangerous to the user as well as society. With the LSD wave came a wave of establishment panic. Suddenly LSD was considered to be more dangerous than heroin (cf. Stafford 1992: 59). Interviews with college presidents, narcotics agents, doctors and other \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67authorities\u8221\'81\'68 appeared creating an atmosphere of  national emergency. Headlines like \u8220\'81\'67Warning to LSD users: You may go blind\u8221\'81\'68, \u8220\'81\'67Mad LSD Slayer\u8221\'81\'68, or \u8220\'81\'67LSD causes chromosome damage\u8221\'81\'68 could be found in nearly every newspaper. Bills that made possession of LSD and other psychedelics a felony were introduced into state legislature throughout the nation (cf. Stafford 1992: 58-62). Under President Nixon, a fierce, rhetorical campaign was launched to define drugs as major source of crime in America and to make the war on drugs and crime a national priority. Nixon declared the (ab-)use of drugs a \u8220\'81\'67national threat\u8221\'81\'68, a threat to personal health and the safety of millions of Americans (cf. Bertram 1996: 4f.). Given these facts, it is not surprising that Nixon called Leary \u8220\'81\'67the most dangerous man on the planet\u8221\'81\'68 \uc1 \u8211\'3f nor is it surprising that Leary found himself in prison on drug charges, facing thirty years incarceration for a small amount of marijuana, six months before he wanted to challenge Ronald Reagan in the election to be governor of California, 1970 (cf. PE  Editor\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s note). This thirty year sentence transformed Leary into the LSD movement\u8217\'81\'66s first martyr. (Of course, Leary appealed the verdict.)\uc1 }

+Peter Stafford notes that in the 60s the confusion among people about the physical and mental effects of psychedelics was great but their knowledge was not so great (cf. Stafford 1992: 20). Both Leary as well as the US government gave a distorted picture of what the effects of psychedelic drugs really are. Leary wanted everybody to take LSD because his own drug experiments were so successful. The government wanted to ban the use of all psychedelics because they only wanted to see only the dangerous aspect of psychedelic drug use (and politicians felt that they lost their power to rule the country). Neither of the two would admit that psychedelic drugs can have positive as well as negative effects. You might have a revealing experience but psychedelics can also be dangerous to your mental health. Encouraging people to question authority is one thing, encouraging people to take drugs that may ruin their lives is another.  }

+We all know LSD-horror-stories, like the one in which an unknowing innocent person takes LSD, becomes depressed, and then commits suicide. Now, is it true that LSD might trigger a serious depression or even suicide attempts? In 1960, Dr. Sidney Cohen (a psychologist attached professionally to UCLA and the Veterans Hospital in Los Angeles) compared forty-four studies on the use of  LSD and mescaline/peyote, trying to find out the dangers of psychedelic drug use and psychedelic treatment.

During a private meeting with members of the Army Chemical Corps, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, who was the head of the investigation, passed around a glass of Cointreau which \uc1 \u8211\'3f unknown to the others \u8211\'3f he had spiked with LSD.

+In the 60s Leary, Ginsberg, Kesey and all the others who wanted to \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67turn on the whole world\u8221\'81\'68 did not seem to notice that there is a big difference between experienced intellectuals like Aldous Huxley, philosopher Gerald Heard, or psychologist Frank Barron, who took LSD trying to systematically cultivate states of \u8220\'81\'67abnormal\u8221\'81\'68 consciousness, and an inexperienced teenager who takes LSD just because it is considered to be \u8220\'81\'67hip,\u8221\'81\'68 not knowing what to expect at all. Leary thought that LSD was good for everybody just because he and his friends (supposedly) had only positive experiences with it.

That is why he \u8220\'81\'67failed to understand the enormous genetic variation in human neurology\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.).

+Leary never really stopped to encourage people to take psychedelics until the day he died. Although in the 70s his focus shifted from drugs to computers and space migration, he nevertheless continued to give lectures on psychedelic drugs. However, in the 70s,  Leary gave up his plan to \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67turn on the whole world,\u8221\'81\'68 but directed his teachings only to those people who were \u8220\'81\'67ready to take the next step in human evolution\u8221\'81\'68(cf. NP 90). Leary realized that LSD was not the magic cure-all (for social, political and neurological problems) he had thought it was. He realized that it was time to change and start looking for new methods to help us escape the narrow reality tunnels imposed on us by authorities. It was time to start looking for new methods that could help us to produce the ecstatic experience, that is, the experience of attaining freedom from all limitations.\uc1 }

In the 70s, Leary was convinced that there was a trend in biological evolution on this planet from water, to shoreline, to land, to atmospheric flight.

Life on planet earth did not seem to evolve to higher levels of being like Leary had expected. The 60s revolution was over.

According to Leary, the hippies\u8217\'81\'66 tragic flaw was that they rejected science and technology.  Leary argues that things like psychedelic drugs, the DNA structure, and also new types of technology for space-travel were not discovered by sheer chance. They would show us the way to the next phase in human evolution bringing us one step closer to our final destination, that is, the final destination of life. \uc1 }

+ (1979, 1996), Leary writes that in the course of history the \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67genetic frontier\u8221\'81\'68 (the best developed culture in terms of technology and intelligence) has moved from the East to the West. East to West means past to future. According to Leary, the East (India, China) was the genetic frontier 3000 years ago. In the sixteenth century, the Enlightenment, Europe was the genetic frontier. In 1976, the West Coast of North America was the genetic frontier (cf. Leary 1996: 177ff.). (Leary calls this area the Sun Belt. The Sun Belt encompasses a crescent of \u8220\'81\'67Migrating Higher Intelligence that stretches from Mountain View, California at the Northwest; through Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico; to Cape Canaveral, Florida at the Southwest.\u8221\'81\'68)  The West Coast of America would be the last terrestrial frontier; from there we would move to outer space (cf. ibid.). To put it in a nutshell: For Leary, technological innovation means intelligence and independence. West means evolution and change. The \u8220\'81\'67genetic runway\u8221\'81\'68 along which gene-pools \u8220\'81\'67accelerate to Escape Velocity\u8221\'81\'68 runs from East to West.\uc1 }

+. At the same time, centralized civilization has produced various technologies which seem to \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67point us upwards away from the heavy pull of gravity.\u8221\'81\'68 Leary suggests that new developments for space-flight as well as the discovery of psychedelic drugs (which would enable us to experience a world where gravity does not exist, thus preparing us for life in outer space) are an indication that there is a trend in biological evolution on this planet from water, to shoreline, to land, to atmospheric flight (outer space, the \u8220\'81\'67new frontier\u8221\'81\'68). In Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Exo-Psychology theory, political and cultural phenomena like war, enslavement, or centralization are seen as \u8220\'81\'67necessary preludes\u8221\'81\'68 to the next phase in human evolution which is space migration. \uc1 }

+According to Leary, the nature of human evolution is paradoxical. For example, there is the Centralization Paradox. Although centralization limits our freedom, it would be necessary to link up in centralized collectives if we want to attain \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67the ultimate freedom of space existence\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67the velocity to escape the planet.\u8221\'81\'68 Without centralized governments and a \u8220\'81\'67diligent, competent, mechanically efficient middle-class\u8221\'81\'68 we would not be able to mobilize the technologies we need for space migration. The same paradox could be found if we look at the phenomenon of war. Leary explains that wars \uc1 \u8211\'3f especially the two World Wars and the Cold War \u8211\'3f  seem absurd \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67until we understand that the genetic purpose of the conflict[s] was to stimulate the development of radar, rocketry, synthetic chemistry, atomic fission, [..] and, most important, computers[...]\u8221\'81\'68 (NP 141). Leary argues that centralization, wars, and the consumer-cultural TV homogeneity of our post-industrial society are all dead ends. However, they are inevitable steps to get to the next phase in human evolution which is space migration.\uc1 }

+Anyway, why should we migrate to space at all? According to Leary, the main reason for space migration is not overpopulation, or a shortage of energy. In his Exo-Psychology theory, Leary suggests that somewhere in outer space there is a \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67Higher Intelligence\u8221\'81\'68 which, a long time ago, sent a message to our planet in form of the DNA, the genetic code. He writes, \u8220\'81\'67[L]ife was seeded on this womb-planet in form of amino-acid templates designed to be activated by solar radiation and to unfold in a series of genetic molts and metamorphoses\u8221\'81\'68(Info 16). Now what does that mean? It means that actually all life forms on our planet are \u8220\'81\'67alien immigrants from outer space\u8221\'81\'68 and that evolution of the various species unfolds according to the same pre-determined plan. According to Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Exo-Psychology theory, life is designed to migrate from the \u8220\'81\'67womb-planet\u8221\'81\'68 (Leary speculates that there might be other unknown womb-planets with life on it), seek this Higher Intelligence, and try to fuse with \u8220\'81\'67Hir\u8221\'81\'68 again. The tactics in order to achieve this final goal would be S.M.I.\uc1 \u178\'3fL.E., which means \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67space migration\u8221\'81\'68 (=S.M.), \u8220\'81\'67intelligence increase\u8221\'81\'68 (=I.\uc1 \u178\'3f), and \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67life extension\u8221\'81\'68 (=L.E.) (cf. NP 143-45). (This acronym can be found printed several times on every page of every single book that Leary wrote in the 70s to remind the reader of the purpose of life.) Intelligence increase would be a necessary prerequisite for space migration and life extension. Psychedelic drugs would help us to enhance our intelligence, and it would not take long until scientists are able to decipher the genetic (DNA) code and extend our life spans. \uc1 }

+In Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s Exo-Psychology theory, the evolution of life and humanity (past, as well as future) is described in terms of the evolution of the nervous system. Now, how did the human nervous system evolve and how is it structured? Leary assumes that our nervous systems consist of eight \u8220\'81\'67potential circuits\u8221\'81\'68, or \u8220\'81\'67gears\u8221\'81\'68, or \u8220\'81\'67mini-brains\u8221\'81\'68 which have evolved in the course of evolution. Leary describes the evolution of the nervous system in his model of the Eight Circuits of Consciousness. Before an outline of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s model of the Eight Circuits of Consciousness is given, it is necessary to make a short excursion into the field of conditioning psychology. Leary says that if we want to understand his Exo-psychology theory and the model of the Eight Circuits of Consciousness we first have to understand the concept of imprinting and that there is a crucial difference between the phenomenon of imprinting and other forms of learning, especially conditioning. (The reader already knows that Leary is interested in the biological phenomenon of \u8220\'81\'67neural imprinting\u8221\'81\'68 very much, and that he thinks that imprints can be suspended and changed by using certain psychoactive chemicals.) \uc1 }

The same applies to animals. If birds are handled by an experimenter during their first few hours of life, they thereafter react to him/her and to other human beings as they normally would to their parents, and they refect their real parents. During this critical period, which is the first of several critical periods in a person\u8217\'81\'66s life, a basic attitude of trust or distrust is set up which will ever after trigger approach or avoidance (cf.

Imprinting, however, is a form of learning which does not require repetition. \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67The most fascinating aspect of imprinting is this; the original selection of the external stimulus [e.g. mother] which triggers off the pre-designed response [e.g. trust] does not derive from a normal learning process but a short exposure during a brief, specific \u8216\'81\'65critical period\u8217\'81\'66[...]\u8221\'81\'68(Info 40). In contrast to all other learning processes, imprinting is immediate and - which is even more important - irreversible. As Leary put it: \u8220\'81\'67\uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

+ [my italics]\uc2 \u8221\'81\'68 (Info 51). To help his readers to get a better understanding of the primary role of the imprint and the secondary role of the conditioned association Leary mentions Ivan Pavlov\u8217\'81\'66s classic study with a dog as an example (everybody knows this experiment): In Pavlov\u8217\'81\'66s study the flow of saliva in the dog\u8217\'81\'66s mouth is an unconditioned, unlearned response. The imprint hooks an unconditioned response (flow of saliva) to an external stimulus, or releaser mechanism (food placed in the dog\u8217\'81\'66s mouth), so that the dog always automatically produces saliva when food is in his mouth. However, the association between the sight of food and the food in the mouth, or between a ringing bell and food, has to be learned by the dog. This is where conditioning comes in. Conditioned stimuli like the ringing bell are associated with the imprinted stimulus which is the food in the dog\u8217\'81\'66s mouth. \uc1 }

By applying psychological conditioning techniques we would be able to temporarily change a person\u8217\'81\'66s behavior. However, as soon as the conditioned person is left to his/her own devices he/she would drift back to the \u8220\'81\'67magnetism of the imprint\u8221\'81\'68 and to his/her \u8220\'81\'67genetic-robot style\u8221\'81\'68 which is determined by the DNA (cf. Info 54). Leary argues that psychedelics can help us to \u8220\'81\'67recast\u8221\'81\'68 the different circuits. With psychedelics we can re-imprint new realities and activate new, higher circuits of consciousness. How exactly do the these higher circuits Leary talks about look like? \uc1 }

It programs perception onto an either-or grid divided into nurturing-helpful Things (which it approaches) and noxious-dangerous Things (which it flees, or attacks). The imprinting of this circuit sets up the basic attitude of trust or suspicion which will last for life (NP 88).}

He points out that the first imprinting process, during which a basic attitude of trust or distrust is set up, will ever after trigger approach or avoidance. If the baby does not develop a basic feeling of trust towards his/her mother during the short critical period during which the first imprint is made, he/she will never be able to develop this basic feeling of trust towards her mother and he/she will never be able to fully trust his/her partner(s) and friends in life either. }

+Leary writes that this brain was formed when \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67hominoid types began to differentiate from other primate stock\u8221\'81\'68 (circa 4-5 million years ago). It is activated in the individual when the older child begins \u8220\'81\'67handling artifacts and sending/receiving laryngeal signals (human speech units)\u8221\'81\'68(NP 89). This circuit discloses the symbolic, conceptual and linguistic world. Leary writes,  \u8220\'81\'67If the environment is stimulating to the third circuit, the child takes a \u8216\'81\'65bright\u8217\'81\'66 imprint and becomes dextrous and articulate; if the environment is made of deliberately stupid people, the child takes a \u8216\'81\'65dump\u8217\'81\'66 imprint, i.e. remains more or less at a stage of symbol-blindness\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). This circuit determines our \u8220\'81\'67normal modes of artifact-manufacture\u8221\'81\'68 and conceptual thought.

It was already in the early 60s when McLuhan came up with the idea that electric circuitry is an extension of the human nervous system (McLuhan 1964: 1). This idea is based on the concept that \u8220\'81\'67all media [i.e. technologies] are extensions of some human faculty \uc1 \u8211\'3f psychic or physical\uc2 \u8221\'81\'68(McLuhan 1967).  For example, the photo is an extension of the eye, the wheel an extension of the foot, etc. \u8220\'81\'67With electricity [radio, television, computers, etc] we extend our nervous systems globally, instantly interrelating every human experience\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). McLuhan predicted that electronic technology would reshape and restructure patterns of social interdependence and every aspect of our personal lives. By involving us in other people\u8217\'81\'66s actions and thoughts, electronic technology would end psychic, social, economic, and political self-centeredness (cf. ibid.). A new form of \u8220\'81\'67politics\u8221\'81\'68 would be emerging because \u8220\'81\'67the living room has become a voting booth\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.) \u8220\'81\'67In the electric age, when our nervous system is technologically extended to involve us in the whole of mankind and to incorporate the whole of mankind in us, we necessarily participate, in depth, in the consequences of our every action,\u8221\'81\'68 writes McLuhan in \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

This means that our ways of thinking and perceiving the world are always determined by the medium we use. McLuhan coined the phrase \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67the medium is the message\u8221\'81\'68 which expresses his idea that it is the medium, not the content, that changes people\u8217\'81\'66s world views.\uc1 }

+In the late 70s and early 80s, Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s model of the Eight Levels of Consciousness and his vision of a post-terrestrial existence free from all limits (free from social and political limitations, as well as the limits of space, time, and the body) influenced quite a few \u8220\'81\'67psychedelic philosophers\u8221\'81\'68(discussed below) and a considerable number of young people interested in altered states of consciousness. Many young people in the early 80s, however, were not only interested in the drug-aspect of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theory. They felt that Leary, by including technology into his vision of the future, helped them to define the new generation they were part of. Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Exo-Psychology theory offered these people who had decided to \u8220\'81\'67leave the flower-power 60s behind\u8221\'81\'68 a new way to live with technology, to make it theirs. In the eyes of these people, Leary resolved the dichotomy between spirituality (the \u8220\'81\'67inner quest\u8221\'81\'68) and science/technology (the \u8220\'81\'67outer quest\u8221\'81\'68).

Like Leary\u8217\'81\'66s books, their books could be placed somewhere between science fiction, psychology, sociology, philosophy, New Age and \u8220\'81\'67underground.\u8221\'81\'68 Robert Anton Wilson \uc1 \u8211\'3f who was a longtime collaborator with Leary and, like Leary, is a spokesman for the psychedelic culture -  talks about Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s model of the Eight Circuits of Consciousness in several of his books, for example in \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

By relating it to a great number of theories from the fields of psychology, philosophy, and atomic physics and adding new ideas about how to increase one\u8217\'81\'66s intelligence, Wilson develops Leary\u8217\'81\'66s model further. Leary claims that Robert Anton Wilson has interpreted his theories better than anybody else (cf. Stafford 1992: III-30). Wilson was influenced by Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Eight Circuit model very much.  Now that Leary is dead Wilson continues to spread Leary\u8217\'81\'66s ideas. At the TRANSCENDANCE-conference in Brithton/England, in 1997, for example, Wilson spent half of his 90-minute talk on explaining Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Eight Circuit model. \uc1 }

+It is hard to say how many young people were influenced by Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s Eight Circuit model in  the 1970s. Of course, there were some of the (ex-)hippies who still read Leary\u8217\'81\'66s books from the 60s. However,  from the fact that Leary was not released from prison before 1976 and that his Exo-psychology works did not appear before 1977 it could be concluded that not many people knew what Leary was doing in the early 70s at all. Furthermore, the \u8220\'81\'67LSD-boom\u8221\'81\'68 was over, so there was no need for an LSD-guru any more. But what about the late 70s when Leary went on lecture tours again?

+In contrast to most of the people in the psychedelic movement of the 60s and 70s, Sirius has never been a technophobe. According to Sirius, there have always been two strands in the  psychedelic counterculture. Sirius explains: \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67A majority strand of people felt overwhelmed by the ugliness of Western civilization and wanted to get as much distance from it as possible. But about ten percent always consisted of \u8216\'81\'65sci-fi\u8217\'81\'66 types. For instance, Digger manifestoes of \u8217\'81\'6667 and \u8217\'81\'6668 anticipated \u8216\'81\'65machines of loving grace\u8217\'81\'66 that would usher in a post-scarcity  culture\u8221\'81\'68(quoted in Stafford 1992: III \uc1 \u8211\'3f 46).

And I maintained that vision, somewhere in the back of my head\u8221\'81\'68 (quoted in Dery 1996: 35).  In 1980, Sirius had a revealing LSD-experience which assured him that his intuition was right.

+It was not until 1983 that Leary bought his first personal computer and discovered how computers really worked \u8211\'3f that the language of computers is based on the principle of 0 and 1 (the transistors in a computer can be switched ON or OFF, representing 1 and 0 in the logical sequence). When Leary learned that in a computer every program and every piece of information is stored in zeros and ones and that theoretically any kind of information \u8211\'3f be it a sound, picture, word, etc \u8211\'3f can be translated into the digital language of 0 and 1, he felt that a \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67new world\u8221\'81\'68 with seemingly endless possibilities was revealed to him. Leary called this world the \u8220\'81\'67Info world\u8221\'81\'68 or \u8220\'81\'67Quantum world\u8221\'81\'68 (I will explain the term \u8220\'81\'67Quantum world\u8221\'81\'68 when I talk about Leary\u8217\'81\'66s Quantum-Psychology). He began spending around five hours a day in this new world on the other side of the screen translating his thoughts to digital codes and screen images (cf. CC 3).

+Leary discovered that computers were actually very similar to LSD. More than that, in an interview with P. Johnston in 1986, Leary said that the computer is a technology for brain change that is even more effective than LSD: \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67Computers are the most subversive thing I\u8217\'81\'66ve ever done. [...] Computers are more addictive than heroin. [...] People need some way to activate, boot up, and change disks in their minds. In the 60s we needed LSD to expand reality and examine our stereotypes. With computers as our mirrors LSD might not be necessary now\u8221\'81\'68 (quoted in Bukatman 1993: 139). This discovery led Leary to proclaim that \u8220\'81\'67The PC is the LSD of the 90s\u8221\'81\'68 (CC cover-page). Leary found out that his experiences with this new medium were far from being unique and original but seemed to be part of an enormous cultural metamorphoses. As a result of personal computers, millions of people, especially the young generation, would no longer be satisfied \u8220\'81\'67to peer like passive infants through the Terrarium wall [TV screen] into ScreenLand [sic] filled with cyberstars like Bill and Hillary and Boris and Sadam and Madonna and Beavis and Butt-Head\u8221\'81\'68(CC 4). People would begin to learn how to \u8220\'81\'67enter and navigate in this world behind the screen\u8221\'81\'68 and avoid television dictatorship. Computers would change the young generation\u8217\'81\'66s appreciation for their own intrinsic worth and ability to alter reality. Leary had a vision of the emergence of a \u8220\'81\'67new humanism\u8221\'81\'68 based on questioning authority, independent thinking, and the empowerment of computers and other technologies. A new global \u8220\'81\'67cybernetic culture\u8221\'81\'68 would be emerging, creating a post-political society based on individual freedom. \uc1 }

CC 7). The computer would help the individual to dissolve, or deconstruct, all rigid thought systems/structures (political, social, and philosophical) into zeros and ones, and create new structures/systems with the freed elements -  structures that are more fun than the old ones. Furthermore, we would be beginning to \u8220\'81\'67understand ourselves as information processes,\u8221\'81\'68 and in the near future there would be technologies available that allow us to manipulate matter as information, which means that we can exist without our blood-and-flesh bodies and become immortal. Leary tries to back these ideas with a bold interpretation of quantum physics and defines a new branch of science called Quantum Psychology (human thought and behavior described in terms of the language of computers). Quantum Psychology would help us to understand the basic nature of the universe and how our brains operate. However, we would not able to apply the principles of quantum physics without computers, which Leary sees as extensions of our brains which  help us to navigate through the meaningless, disordered, chaotic universe and to design ourselves individual realities. As far as the correlation of personal computers and personal freedom is concerned, Leary says that freedom in any country could be measured perfectly by the percentage of personal computers in the hands of individuals (cf. CC 84). \uc1 }

Leary argues that personal computers, TV, and the Internet encouraged young people from all over the world to think for themselves, question authority, and start a freedom revolution which lead to the fall of various political regimes in the late 80s (fall of the Berlin Wall, Czech hard-line regime toppled, etc). According to Leary,  this \u8220\'81\'67digital freedom revolution\u8221\'81\'68 is still going on. Leary was very optimistic as far as the liberating effect of electronic technology and the future of this freedom movement is concerned. In the near future we would all find ourselves living in a post-political society that functions according to the cybernetic principles of self-organization \uc1 \u8211\'3f a society where the person who automatically obeys and never questions authority will be the \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67problem person\u8221\'81\'68 and  the intelligent person who knows how to live in symbiosis with technology and who thinks for him-/herself (the cyberpunk) will be the norm. Furthermore, we would soon be able to \u8220\'81\'67download\u8221\'81\'68 our mind/brain into a computer, which means that we do not need our bodies to survive any more and that we can become immortal. \uc1 }

+The majority of people on our planet, however, are afraid to face chaos. They are afraid to face the fact that safety and order is only an illusion. According to Leary, this fear of chaos explains why for centuries there existed a fanatic taboo against scientific thinking. He points out that \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67Galileo got busted\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67Bruno got the Vatican microwave\u8221\'81\'68 for showing that the sun did not circle the earth, just \u8220\'81\'67because religious and political chaos-phobes wanted the nice, tidy, comfy universe to cuddle around them\u8221\'81\'68 (CC  xiv). The standard method with which religious and political \u8220\'81\'67control freaks\u8221\'81\'68 would try to tame and domesticate the impossible complexity that surrounds us is to \u8220\'81\'67invent a few \u8216\'81\'65tooth-fairy\u8217\'81\'66 Gods\u8221\'81\'68 (the more infantile the better) and to \u8220\'81\'67lay down a few childish, simple rules like \u8216\'81\'65Honor you father and your mother\u8217\'81\'66\u8221\'81\'68 or \u8220\'81\'67You passively obey. You pray. You work.\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). According to Leary, scientific thinking and thinking for oneself has always been considered \u8220\'81\'67heretical, treasonous, blasphemous, a capital crime, the ultimate nightmare\u8221\'81\'68 by religious and political fanatics. However, you cannot hide the truth forever. Leary points out that, in the nineteenth and twentieth century, scientists \uc1 \u8211\'3f with the help of technical extensions of the human sensorium like telescopes and microscopes - began to specify the \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67truly spooky\u8221\'81\'68 nature of the complexities around us and within us (e.g., they found out that the brain is a network of hundred billion neurons, each neuron being connected to ten thousand other neurons). According to Leary, among the various scientific theories which have been advanced in the last hundred years there is one theory that changed human life more than any other \uc1 \u8211\'3f quantum physics.  Leary argues that equations of quantum physics perfectly describe the chaotic universe we live in:}

+Now how does Leary interpret quantum physics? According to Leary, the quantum physicists (Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck etc) discovered that we live in a universe made up of bits of information, \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67a universe of elemental off/on digital bits (particles) that swirl in chaotic clouds, occasionally clustering together in geometrically logical temporary configurations\u8221\'81\'68 (cf. CC 44). In the universe described by the quantum physicists solid Newtonian matter becomes waves or clouds of 0/1, yin/yang, on/off probabilities(cf. CC 45). According to Leary, the equations of quantum physics suggest that solid matter is nothing but \u8220\'81\'67frozen information\u8221\'81\'68 (cf. CC 6). (This means we do not have the body-mind dualism any more; everything is information.) Realities could be explained metaphorically as screens of digitized patterns (cf. Info 2). The universe, according to the equations of quantum physics, would be best described as a \u8220\'81\'67digital information processor with subprograms and temporary ROM states, megas called galaxies, maxis called stars, minis called planets, micros called organisms or Macintosh, and nanos called molecules and atoms\u8221\'81\'68 (CC 44). All of these programs are perpetually in states of evolution, that is, continually \u8220\'81\'67running.\u8221\'81\'68 Furthermore, quantum theory suggests that the behavior of atomic particles, and thus of the universe, is governed by a single programming rule: it is nothing but \u8220\'81\'67if-then algorithms\u8221\'81\'68(cf. CC 14). Leary explains that the application of quantum physics produced vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, radio, television, computers, etc - all the important gadgets that can move around information (cf. CC 6f.). \uc1 }

+Leary argues that the quantum physicists were explaining ideas that can only be fully understood now, in the electronic-information age. The knowledge that we live in a chaotic universe consisting of digital bits of information \u8211\'3f Leary calls this universe Quantum universe - is useless for the individual human as long as he/she does not have tools that enable him/her to make that chaotic universe \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67user-friendly.\u8221\'81\'68 In order to make the Quantum universe user-friendly the individual would need electrical appliances that allow him/her to cruise around in the \u8220\'81\'67chaotic post-Newtonian information ocean,\u8221\'81\'68 to think and communicate in the digital language of light. Leary also calls the digital language of light \u8220\'81\'67lingua franca of the universe\u8221\'81\'68 or \u8220\'81\'67binary dialect of the galaxies and atoms\u8221\'81\'68(cf. CC 45). Leary points out that, although Einstein and his colleagues developed theories that were to change the world, they were not able to apply their theories to their own lives. They did not have computers that allowed them to digitize, store, create, and communicate their individual realities. In \u8220\'81\'67Quantum Jumps, Your Macintosh, and you,\u8221\'81\'68 Leary explains this paradoxical situation the quantum physicists were in:\uc1 }

+For Leary, the application of the laws of quantum physics has to do with freedom. The universe that quantum physicists describe would open up endless possibilities for the individual. Electrical \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67quantum-appliances,\u8221\'81\'68 like computers, interactive TV, or virtual reality gear (TV goggles and quadrophonic sound systems to create 3-D computer graphic worlds), would enable us to apply the principles of quantum physics so we can pilot ourselves through the chaotic universe - Leary calls this \u8220\'81\'67chaos engineering\u8221\'81\'68 - and create 3-D digital realities where we can meet with people from the other side of the planet. More than that, the application of quantum physics would allow us to \u8220\'81\'67real-ize\u8221\'81\'68 the realities of our dreams, the limits of which are determined only by the limits of our imagination. This means that we would actually be able to free ourselves from any kind of structure (political, social, personal) that is imposed on us. Information technology would enable us to dissolve existing structures and create new forms, new (virtual) realities with the freed elements. We would be beginning to understand ourselves as information processes, and soon there would be new technologies available that allow us to manipulate matter as information. This would mean that we can finally free ourselves from our heavy, clumsy, mortal bodies and become immortal. \uc1 }

+We already know that since the early 1960s Leary has always been interested in finding out how the human brain operates and how we can use our brains in the most sufficient way. In all of his theories Leary argues that the best way to understand and describe the evolution of the human race is in terms of how well we have learned to operate our brains. In \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67Our Brain\u8221\'81\'68 (CC 35-39), for example, he suggests that since the 1950s, when people began to use electrical appliances (television, radio), there has been an enormous acceleration of brain power. In just the last ten years new developments in technology, especially computer technology, would have multiplied the ability to use our brains by a thousandfold (!). The best way to understand how efficiently we are using our brains would be to clock it in rpm \uc1 \u8211\'3f realities per minute. Now that we have television (hundreds of programs to choose), the internet and other new information technologies, our brains would be operating at a hundred times more rpm than the brains of people living thirty or forty years ago \u8211\'3f and still we would be hungry for more.}

+It should be mentioned here that, according to Leary, historical technological development is following an exponential law. This means that there is a general tendency that there will be more basic breakthroughs (both in scientific and technological applications) in each generation than in the previous generation. Leary argues that this acceleration of technological development is in direct relation to an acceleration in human brain power/intelligence. In other words, although people in the Stone Age had basically the same brain as we have they were by far not as intelligent as we are because they did not have the technologies that helped them to effectively use their brains.

+Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s explanation for this enormous acceleration of brain power and the brain\u8217\'81\'66s insatiable hunger for more data is an evolutionary one: As our brain evolves, it develops new and more effective vehicles and information-processing devices in order to feed its insatiable hunger for stimulation (television in the 50s, audio tapes in the 60s, personal computers in the 70s, etc). A person with a cybernetic post-industrial brain would no longer be content \u8220\'81\'67to watch a tiring two-hour movie, or sit drinking tea and reading the London Times for two hours,\u8221\'81\'68 like people did in the mechanical age (cf. CC 14). \u8220\'81\'67The cybernetic brain expects more data in much less time\u8221\'81\'68, Leary explains (ibid.). The cybernetic brain \u8220\'81\'67loves overload\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). For the information-age cyberperson the best stuff he/she sees in the movies would be the three-minute trailers with two cuts per second, which Leary calls \u8220\'81\'67electronic haikus.\u8221\'81\'68 Leary argues that the use of electronic technology has elevated us to a new genetic status; a new species, the \u8220\'81\'67homo sapiens electronicus,\u8221\'81\'68 has emerged (cf. CC 45). According to Leary, the growing appetite for digital data can now be recognized as a species need. Leary points out that the brain of the homo sapiens electronicus \u8220\'81\'67needs electrons (and psychoactive chemicals) like the body needs oxygen\u8221\'81\'68 (ibid.). Like any adolescent organ, the human brain would require an enormous, continual supply of chemical and electronic data to keep growing towards maturity\uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs20\lang1033\loch\f5

+Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s Quantum Psychology theory encourages people to use electronic technology (computers, the Internet, etc) for their personal empowerment. In the 90s Leary updated his old catchphrase \u8220\'81\'67 Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out\u8221\'81\'68 to \u8220\'81\'67Turn On, Boot Up, Jack In.\u8221\'81\'68  Electronic technology would enable us to free ourselves from dogmatic social structures and create our own cyber-realities (cyberspace). More than that,  Leary argues that the use of electronic technology has elevated us to a new genetic status. People who grew up using electronic appliances for thinking and communicating would constitute a new species, which Leary calls the New Breed, or the cyberpunks.  Leary writes that the New Breed of the 80s and 90s are people who have learned how to use technology to reach their own private goals and change the world to the better. According to Leary, this New Breed is creating a new post-political cybernetic society which is based on personal freedom and functions according to the cybernetic principles of self-organization and feedback (I will explain these principles later). It would be a society that does not operate on the basis of obedience and conformity to dogma - a society based on individual thinking, scientific know-how, quick exchange of facts around feedback networks, high-tech ingenuity, and front-line creativity (cf. PE 4). Leary notes that the youth revolutions of 1989, which, according to Leary, led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the resignation of the hard\uc1 \u8211\'3fline regimes in Czechoslovakia and Rumania, are signs how powerful this revolution really is.

+Leary points out that the post-war Baby Boom generation was the first generation that grew up with television: \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67From the time they could peer out of the crib the young Baby Boomers of the 50s were exposed to a constant shower of information beaming from screens.\u8221\'81\'68 According to Leary, television taught the Baby Boomers to be \u8220\'81\'67reality consumers.\u8221\'81\'68 \u8220\'81\'67Before they were ten, their brains were processing more realities per day than their grandparents had confronted in a year,\u8221\'81\'68 Leary explains (CC 78). Leary argues that the media that a child grows up with are of crucial importance because between the ages of three and eight \u8220\'81\'67the language circuits of the brain are formatted\u8221\'81\'68 (this is the period of imprint vulnerability for everything that has to do with language). This means that the media used in the home of the child has an everlasting influence on the way this person thinks and perceives the world (cf. ibid.). \uc1 }

+What happened when the Baby Boomers became teenagers? We all know that they evolved into the hippies of the 60s and started a freedom revolution. Leary describes these teenagers as affluent, self-confident, spoiled consumers, \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67ready to use their television-radio skills to be imprinted by turning on Bob Dylan, tuning in the Beatles, turning off parents songs, and fine-tuning color screens\u8221\'81\'68 (CC 82). Although their attitude was anti-high-tech,  the hippies have used the media and electrically powered music to spread their ideas. When the 60s revolution, the LSD-boom, and the Vietnam war were over the hippies became the Yuppies of the late 70s and 80s. \uc1 }

+However, the revolution was not over yet because the personal computer entered the \uc2 \u8216\'81\'65game.\u8217\'81\'66 Leary argues that the millions of Americans who experienced the awesome potentialities of the brain via LSD certainly paved the way for the computer society we now live in. According to Leary, many of the people who were involved in the development of the personal computer got their inspiration from psychedelic drug experiences. He suggests that without the psychedelic revolution in the 60s, the personal computer would have been unthinkable. \u8220\'81\'67It\u8217\'81\'66s well known that most of the creative impulse in the software industry, and indeed much of the hardware [...] derived directly form the sixties consciousness movement,\u8221\'81\'68 he asserts. \u8220\'81\'67[The Apple cofounder] Steve Jobs went to India, took a lot of acid, studied Buddhism, and came back and said that Edison did more to influence the human race than Buddha. And [Microsoft founder Bill] Gates was a big psychedelic person at Harvard. It makes perfect sense to me that if you activate your brain with psychedelic drugs, the only way you can describe it is electronically\u8221\'81\'68(quoted in Dery 1996: 28).

+According to Leary, in the early 80s a new generation of young people emerged and  continued the freedom revolution of the 60s, using personal computers and the electronic media in a subversive way. Leary points out that this new generation, which grew up creating their own realities with arcade games and personal computers, was the first generation in human history that was able to change electronic patterns on the other side of the screen. Leary believes that this New Breed which, in his opinion, was very much influenced by the ideals of the hippies (individuality, freedom of expression, etc) is responsible for the fall of several repressive political regimes in Europe and Russia in the late 80s and early 90s. By looking at the methods that students in the 60s applied to change the world, the youth in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, South Korea, and China have learned how to lead their freedom revolutions. Leary makes us aware that, again, it was the media that played the crucial role in the transmission of the idea of freedom:}

+Now how does Leary define the term \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67cyberpunk\u8221\'81\'68? According to Leary, there is a whole philosophy and a long history behind this term. Leary says that, in order to understand what the word \u8220\'81\'67cyberpunk,\u8221\'81\'68 or \u8220\'81\'67cyber-person\u8221\'81\'68 really means, we have to go back to the Greek roots of  the term \u8220\'81\'67cybernetics\u8221\'81\'68. Leary explains that the term \u8220\'81\'67cybernetics\u8221\'81\'68 comes from the Greek word \u8220\'81\'67kubernetes\u8221\'81\'68 which means \u8220\'81\'67pilot\u8221\'81\'68 or \u8220\'81\'67steersman\u8221\'81\'68(cf. CC 64). The Hellenic origin of this word is important in that it reflects the Socratic-Platonic traditions of independence and individual self-reliance which, according to Leary, derived from the geographical situation in Greece. In the following quotation Leary explains how the geographical situation in Greece encouraged people to be self-reliant:\uc1 }

+Mariners of these ancient days had to be bold and resourceful. Sailing the seven seas without maps or navigational equipment, they were forced to develop independence of thought.

The Greek word for pilot became the Latin word for governor, \u8220\'81\'67to steer\u8221\'81\'68 became \u8220\'81\'67to control.\u8221\'81\'68 In Leary\u8217\'81\'66s opinion the word \u8220\'81\'67governor\u8221\'81\'68 expresses an attitude of \u8220\'81\'67obedience-control in relationship to self and others\u8221\'81\'68 (CC 66).

The term \u8220\'81\'67governor\u8221\'81\'68 encourages people to think in terms of obedience and control rather than independence and self-reliance. According to Leary, semantic manipulations are quite relevant to the pragmatics of the culture surrounding their usage. Leary quotes French philosopher Michel Foucault who said that\uc1 }

+Cybernetics is the study of control and communication processes in living and artificial systems. The cyberneticists - who were mathematicians, neuroscientists, social scientists and engineers  - were concerned with describing patterns of communication and control that underlie electronic, mechanical, and biological systems. They clearly distinguished the patterns of organization of a system from its physical structure. This is an important distinction because it allowed them to define patterns of organization (organizational principles) that do not only apply to one particular system, but to all systems, irrespective of their nature (cf. Capra 1997: 51f.).}

While studying the mechanisms of self-regulating machines like the thermostat, or the steam engine, the cyberneticists made an important discovery. Although self-regulating machines had existed long before cybernetics, the cyberneticists were the first ones who recognized that these machines involved a mechanism which Norbert Wiener called \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67feedback loop.\u8221\'81\'68 Fritiof Capra explains the concept of feedback as follows: \uc1 }

+Leary was fascinated by the fact that feedback can create a system that regulates itself and does not need an outside force to control it. Being a person who is against centralism, he was very much interested in the decentralizing effect that feedback might have on the information society we live in. He was convinced that the feedback created by people communicating via the Internet, interactive media, etc, was going to change the world to the better. As more and more people become connected, more feedback could occur and create a living system that does not depend on rigid structures of control and domination in order to exist. }

+Feedback is information about a process used to change that process. One remarkable fact about neurophysiology is that nerve signals don\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66t carry explicitly encoded information. A nerve fiber carries signals to the brain. It is the brain that somehow manufactures the richness of our perceptual experience from these signals. Only by correlating the input signals with the internal state of the perceptual apparatus can sense be made of the signals. Changes of sensation are correlated with motor activity. Here is our circularity again: movements are required for perception, and perception required for movements. Even seemingly simple muscular acts couldn\u8217\'81\'66t be accomplished  without feedback (DD 50).\uc1 }

+Leary argues that feedback (i.e., self-reference) in cybernetic organization leads to \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67fractal forms.\u8221\'81\'68 What is a fractal form? The term \u8220\'81\'67fractal\u8221\'81\'68 (coined by chaos mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot) is used to describe \u8220\'81\'67a shape whose details resemble the whole thing. A mountain range is a kind of fractal, since if you look at an outcropping of rock on a mountain, it looks like a small mountain itself, and if you lean closer to the rock outcropping, you find bumps on the boulders which themselves look like mountains, and so on\u8221\'81\'68(Rucker 1992: 45). Fractal forms can be described with the help of circular equations. These equations are called circular equations because after you get an answer, you plug it back into the original equation again and again, countless times (cf. Rushkoff 1995: 22). This image of the fractal - similar components repeated at each level of scale - gives us a better picture of what Leary means. Leary imagines the interpersonal organization of communicating individuals in an information society (a society which is based on unlimited information exchange) as a huge fractal: \u8220\'81\'67I, as a person, am similar to you. Yet the juxtaposition of us and millions of others in a fractally organized system results in the apparent complexity of the system as a whole\u8221\'81\'68(DD 33). The mind of a single person is seen by Leary as interacting fractal subsystems. \u8220\'81\'67As inside, so outside,\u8221\'81\'68 Leary says, reminding us of medieval mystics who expressed their insights into the real nature of the world in the sentence \u8220\'81\'67As above, so below\u8221\'81\'68(DD 36). Leary holds that we are all made up of many \u8220\'81\'67selves\u8221\'81\'68 and that circuitous routes of communication exist between these selves. He refers to computer pioneer Marvin Minsky who argues that the mind is made up of independent interacting pieces of soft machinery (cf. DD 32). Leary concludes that the principles of organization that apply to the interpersonal organization of communicating individuals in an information society also apply to the intrapersonal organization of selves in a functioning individual. \uc1 }

+How can order arise from chaos? To answer this question Leary refers to a theory by  Russian-born chemist and physicist Ilya Prigogine. The theory is called \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67theory of dissipative structures.\u8221\'81\'68 This theory is the first, and perhaps most influential, detailed description of self-organizing systems (cf. Capra 1997: 88). During the 60s Prigogine developed a new nonlinear thermodynamics to describe the self-organization phenomena in open systems far from equilibrium. While studying the processes of heat convection, Prigogine discovered that there are phenomena which cannot be described with the laws of classical thermodynamics. According to the second law of thermodynamics, there is a trend in physical phenomena from order to disorder. Any isolated, or \u8220\'81\'67closed,\u8221\'81\'68 physical system will proceed spontaneously in the direction of ever-increasing disorder. The phenomena that Prigogine discovered, however, showed that in an open system far from equilibrium coherence and order can arise from thermal chaos. Unlike closed systems, which settle into a state of thermal equilibrium, open systems maintain themselves far from equilibrium in a quasi-steady state characterized by continual flow and change (cf. Capra 1997: 88f.).\uc1 }

This means what we accept as objective reality is actually a construction of our minds. Although constructivism was not identifiable as a theoretical orientation until the 1920s or 1930s, constructivist positions have been postulated through the years from classical times (e.g., the scepticist Epimenides from Crete) to the Enlightenment (e.g., philosopher Immanuel Kant) to our modern age (e.g., psychologist Jean Piaget). Kant, for example, argued that humans cannot directly experience external reality because they cannot escape the \u8220\'81\'67categories\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67forms of perception\u8221\'81\'68(time, space) through which they perceive the world. Ergo, the \u8220\'81\'67Ding an sich\u8221\'81\'68 (objective reality) remains an enigma (cf. ibid. 6). Constructivists argue that humans impose order on their sensory experience of the outside world, rather than discern it, and that they create knowledge, rather than discover it.

This means that the models of reality we create can help us to organize our experiential world, but they cannot help us to discover an objective reality. \uc1 }

Leary argues that Heisenberg\u8217\'81\'66s uncertainty principle, which states that a subatomic particle\u8217\'81\'66s position and momentum cannot both be accurately known, has serious implications for philosophy and science, as well as for our everyday lives (cf. ibid.).

This gives the responsibility for reality construction not to a bad-natured biblical God or to an impersonal, mechanical process of entropic devolution, or to an omniscient Marxist state, but to individual brains.

+Classical physics suggests that atoms are hard, solid particles that exist independent of an observer (cf. Capra 1982: 78). The quantum physicists, however, discovered that atoms  and subatomic particles are far from being hard, solid objects. The quantum theory of Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, et al. suggests that subatomic particles are very abstract entities that have a dual nature. Depending on how we look at them, they appear sometimes as particles, sometimes as waves. But how can something be, at the same time, a particle, an entity confined to a very small space, and a wave which is spread out over a large region of space?  Fritjof Capra explains: }

Whenever we use classical terms \u8211\'3f particle, wave, position, velocity \u8211\'3f to describe atomic phenomena, we find that there are pairs of concepts, or aspects, which are interrelated and cannot be defined simultaneously in a precise way.

According to Leary, our usual habit of screening out all signals not compatible with our own favorite reality-map is the mechanism which keeps us all far stupider than we should. If we want to become more intelligent we have to be able to change the models of reality imprinted in our brains and learn to see the world through different models simultaneously. According to Leary, intelligence means awareness of detail. The more signals you receive/process per second the more intelligent you are (cf. CC 35ff.).}

+Like many constructivists, cognitive psychologists, and cyberneticists, Leary sees the brain as an information processing system (computer). Our minds, according to this metaphor, serve as the software that programs the neural hardware (cf. CC 39). According to Leary, most of the classic psychological terms can now be redefined in terms of computer concepts. The psychological process of imprinting, for example, could now be called \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67formatting the brain.\u8221\'81\'68 Imprinting means sudden programming of the brain. Leary explains: \u8220\'81\'67Imprinting is a multimedia input of data. For a baby, it\u8217\'81\'66s the warmth of the mother, the softness, the sound, the taste of the breast. That\u8217\'81\'66s called booting up or formatting. Now baby\u8217\'81\'66s brain is hooked to Mama and then of course from Mama to Daddy, food, etc., but it \u8216\'81\'65s the Mama file that\u8217\'81\'66s the first imprint\u8221\'81\'68(CC 35). (The reader who has read chapter three, where the concept of imprinting as interpreted by Leary is explained, should be able to understand this quotation.) According to Leary, psychedelic drugs enable us to \u8220\'81\'67re-formate the brain,\u8221\'81\'68 that is, to change imprints. This means that if one takes LSD one\u8217\'81\'66s experience of life is reevaluated in a neutral context and put it into a new order (cf. ibid.). This process of \u8220\'81\'67re-formatting the brain\u8221\'81\'68 corresponds to John Lilly\u8217\'81\'66s concept of \u8220\'81\'67metaprogramming,\u8221\'81\'68 which is explained in chapter 3.3., \u8220\'81\'67The Neuroelectric-Metaprogramming Circuit.\u8221\'81\'68 (It should be mentioned here that Leary\u8217\'81\'66s computer-brain model was inspired by John Lilly\u8217\'81\'66s model of the \u8220\'81\'67human biocomputer\u8221\'81\'68 which Lilly developed in the mid 60s.

+In Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s Quantum Psychology psychedelic drugs do not play a central role. In various interviews Leary proclaimed that the personal computer is the LSD of the 1990s.

+Leary concludes that, given these facts, it is not surprising that LSD was considered to be dangerous and morally wrong when it first appeared in the 60s. According to Leary, the LSD-hysteria is over now because psychedelic drug usage is no longer a trendy topic for the media and politicians; we have new problems (oil, \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67crack\u8221\'81\'68, the New Cold War, etc). Now that the LSD-hysteria has died down, more and more smart young people are learning how to intelligently use brain-change drugs like LSD for recreational purposes and to reach enlightenment. More and more people realize that the ultimate (and only) pleasure organ is the brain, \u8220\'81\'67an enormous hundred-billion-cell hedonic system waiting to be activated\u8221\'81\'68(CC 100). There are almost no bad trips being reported, because \u8220\'81\'67the acid is clean and the users are sophisticated\u8221\'81\'68 (ibid.). According to Leary, the average suburban teenager today knows more about the varied effects of brain-change drugs than the most learned researcher twenty years ago\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). \uc1 }

+Leary points out that, in addition to the pure LSD that is now available, new brain change drugs (\uc2 \u8220\'81\'67designer drugs\u8221\'81\'68) are now appearing in plentiful quantities. In comparison to the \u8220\'81\'67crude\u8221\'81\'68 psychedelics of long duration and unpredictable effect that were used in the 60s (e.g., STP), the new shortacting drugs (e.g., MDMA, the favorite drug of people in the techno-rave scene) would be safer and easier to handle. As Leary puts it: \u8220\'81\'67Just as computers today are more efficient, cheaper, and more reliable than those thirty years ago, so are the drugs\u8221\'81\'68(ibid.). Leary predicts that the next decade will see the emergence of dozens of new, improved, stronger, safer, psychoactive drugs \uc1 \u8211\'3f and people would be ready for these new drugs: }

+According to Leary, this increase in popularity of psychedelic drugs, especially LSD, is closely linked to the fact that we are living in a world where everything is changing faster and faster. There would be an enormous acceleration of knowledge we have to keep up with in order to survive in the new information society. Psychedelics, especially LSD, would help us to cope with this acceleration by accelerating our brain functions. In his earlier theories, in the 60s and 70s, Leary suggests that LSD allows us to temporarily suspend our imprints (which means that we leave our rigid reality tunnels and enter a multi-choice reality-labyrinth) and re-imprint new, more complex, funnier realities. In terms of Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s Quantum Psychology, this means that under the influence of the drug there is a dramatic increase in the amount of information processed per second. The more new circuits are opened in the brain (the \u8220\'81\'67ROM brain-circuits\u8221\'81\'68), the more new information we notice in the objects we perceive. Leary argues that those people who like LSD will always be able to deal with what is to come because they know how to \u8220\'81\'67surf the waves of chaotic change\u8221\'81\'68 planfully. \u8220\'81\'67\uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

+Leary was definitely right when he said that \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67the future is going to spin faster and wilder\u8221\'81\'68 - no matter if we took LSD or not.  In the last couple of decades there has been an enormous acceleration of technological development so that today we are literally not able to predict which new, groundbreaking technologies will be discovered tomorrow. Technology is changing faster and faster. What was still considered to be science fiction yesterday is reality today (Internet, virtual reality, cloning, etc). In Leary\u8217\'81\'66s opinion this accelerating change rate is a sign that things are getting better. As far as changes that new technologies introduce into society are concerned, Leary has always been an optimist: He thought that  computers, the Internet, and other interactive media would help us to dissolve hierarchical social structures, create the realities of our dreams, make the world a better place to live in. More than that, decentralization of power and the emergence of a self-organizing cyber society would actually be the inevitable consequences of these new technologies. Computers, as well as psychedelic drugs, would enable us to break out of practically all (social, political and personality-brain) structures that limit our thinking and perception and force us to behave in a certain way. This means we (theoretically) have total control over the courses of our lives. \uc1 }

+Leary writes that first step towards solving the problem of death is to deprogram the \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67dying reflexes\u8221\'81\'68 imprinted in our brains by our culture and start thinking scientifically about alternatives to \u8220\'81\'67going quietly and passively into the dark night or the neon-lit, Muzak-enhanced Disney-heaven of the Jesus Gang.\u8221\'81\'68 Leary points out  that in pre-cybernetic cultures  \u8220\'81\'67the reflexive genetic duty of the top management (those in social control of the various gene pools) was to make humans feel weak, helpless, and dependent in the face of death. The good of the race or nation was ensured at the cost of the sacrifice of the individual\u8221\'81\'68(CC 188). By controlling the \u8220\'81\'67dying reflexes\u8221\'81\'68 and orchestrating the trigger stimuli that activate the \u8220\'81\'67death circuits\u8221\'81\'68 (accomplished through rituals that imprint dependence and docility when the \u8220\'81\'67dying alarm bells go off\u8221\'81\'68 in the brain) the gene-pool managers have maintained the attitude of dedication, obedience, and submission. For millennia the fear of death has depreciated individual confidence and increased dependence on authority. However, now that the individual is empowered by computers and other technologies, he/she would start thinking for him-/herself and question authority. People would learn to deprogram the \u8220\'81\'67dying reflexes\u8221\'81\'68 and take personal responsibility for their dying process. \uc1 }

He also predicts that, \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67In the near future, what is now taken for granted as the perishable human creature will be a mere historical curiosity, one point amidst unimaginable, multidimensional diversity of form. Individuals [...] will be free to choose to reassume flesh-and-blood form, constructed for the occasion by the appropriate science\u8221\'81\'68(CC 202). According to Leary, all the new technologies that have been developed in the last couple of decades (especially computer-information technology) indicate that natural evolution of the human species is near completion. Leary points out that some people (especially computer scientists) are no longer interested in merely procreating, they are designing their successors. He quotes Hans Moravec who writes, \u8220\'81\'67We owe our existence to organic evolution. But we owe it little loyalty. We are on the threshold of change in the universe comparable to the transition from nonlife to life\u8221\'81\'68(CC 199). What Moravec and Leary mean is that humanity has now reached a turning point in the operation of the process of evolution. We are entering the \u8220\'81\'67posthuman\u8221\'81\'68 age.

Now the question arises: Is this countercultural  movement Leary is talking about really going to change the world? Is this new counterculture really going to create a post-political society based on individual freedom? Will the techno-utopia that Leary\u8217\'81\'66s cyberpunks believe in finally become reality? Or is the techno-eschatology that Leary\u8217\'81\'66s cyberpunks put their faith in nothing more than a naive escapist fantasy that blinds us to the real (social, political, economic, and ecological) problems all around us? \uc1 }

+Before I will try to answer these questions in a critical analysis of the cyberdelic  counterculture of the 90s, I want to shortly compare the three most important theories that Leary has produced in the course of his career as counterculture spokesman. There are two reasons why I think that is useful to make this comparison (which can also be read as a summary) before discussing the cybernetic counterculture of the 90s:   }

+First of all, if we really want to understand the cyberdelic counterculture of the 90s we first have to go back to the 60s, because the cyberpunks and \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67cyber-hippies\u8221\'81\'68 of the 90s have adopted many ideas and beliefs from the hippies of the 60s. One way to find out what the cyberdelic counterculture of the 90s and the psychedelic counterculture of the 60s have in common is to study Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theories. The comparison I am going to make will help me to show that the difference between these two countercultures is not as big as one might think. According to Leary, the 90s counterculture is actually a continuation of the 60s counterculture. As Leary might put it: The goal has remained the same, only the methods/technologies have changed. \uc1 }

+Second, this comparison will help me to show that the hippies were not nearly as rural and anti-technology as some cultural critics argue. Leary, the controversial Harvard psychologist, was very well aware that he was \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67turning on the world\u8221\'81\'68 with a high-tech product (LSD) and that a large part of  the hippies did not on principle reject technology. According to Leary, all the hippies wanted was to experience ecstasy and freedom - freedom from self-imposed limitations as well as limitations imposed on them by society - and, for them, the high-tech product LSD was acceptable because it helped them to reach their goal. \uc1 }

+Ad 1.) All of Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s theories are based on the belief that \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 is a construction of our minds/nervous systems. In other words, the observer (i.e., the observer\u8217\'81\'66s nervous system)  creates the universe, or \u8220\'81\'67reality tunnel,\u8221\'81\'68 he/she lives in. It could be said that Leary\u8217\'81\'66s major thesis, in all of his theories, is that in this century the human nervous system has discovered its own creativity and its own limitations. We have discovered that the realities our parents, governmental institutions, priests, and scientists are trying to impose on us are arbitrary constructions and that the only way to escape these \u8220\'81\'67reality tunnels\u8221\'81\'68  imposed on us is to learn to understand how our brains operate and use this knowledge to create our own realities. All of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s theories describe models that explain how the human brain works, and suggest different methods which, according to Leary, can help us to escape the \u8220\'81\'67authorized realities\u8221\'81\'68 that are \u8220\'81\'67jealously guarded by the ones in power.\u8221\'81\'68 \uc1 }

+In the 60s and 70s, Leary used the concept of imprinting to explain how the brain works. According to Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s Exo-Psychology theory, there are certain brief \u8220\'81\'67critical periods\u8221\'81\'68 in a human being\u8217\'81\'66s life during which imprints are made. These imprints (fixed neural structures) determine our realities; they determine what we will see and will \u8220\'81\'67not see.\u8221\'81\'68 Imprints are permanent. Only strong bio-chemical shock can suspend an imprint. The method/technology to change imprints that Leary suggests is to take LSD. According to Leary, during a psychedelic drug experience the imprints in a person\u8217\'81\'66s brain are suspended and the person can consciously re-imprint new realities, realities he/she likes better than the old ones.\uc1 }

In his Quantum-Psychology theory, he explains that the brain converts every sensory stimulation into directories and files of 0/1 signals. The sensory input programs the brain and determines the realities that we inhabit. This means that every \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 consists of 0/1 bits of information. According to Leary, this is the reason why for the brain digital (screen-) realities are not less real than the \u8220\'81\'67material\u8221\'81\'68 reality and why the computer can help us to create our own (digital) realities.\uc1 }

As Leary puts it: \u8220\'81\'67As inside, so outside.\u8221\'81\'68 All of the different levels of reality (nervous system, social system, etc) are logically connected. This means that if we change our perception of the world and our thinking, the world will automatically change as well (because everything is logically connected). So any individual being has the ability to redesign reality at large (cf. DD 32f.). According to Leary, the fractal nature of the universe can be experienced when we take LSD.\uc1 }

If we compare Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s different theories, in which he captures the most important beliefs and ideas that prevailed in the different countercultures he was part of, we find that the countercultures that Leary describes (the Beats, the Hippies, the cyberpunks) have many things in common. Most important of all, they all have the same aim: Individual freedom. According to Leary, the Beats, the Hippies, and the cyberpunks all belong to one and the same revolutionary movement. In his theories, Leary tries to show that this movement which has its roots in the 50s (the Beats) and 60s (the Hippies) is creating \u8220\'81\'67a post-political society that is based on Ecstasy, i.e. the experience of individual freedom\u8221\'81\'68(PE 2) Now how does Leary define the terms \u8220\'81\'67Ecstasy\u8221\'81\'68 and \u8220\'81\'67individual freedom\u8221\'81\'68? For Leary, freedom means much more than free expression or having the right to vote. It is a state of consciousness in which all limits are transcended \uc1 \u8211\'3f Ecstasy.

From the Greek \u8216\'81\'65ex-stasis.\u8217\'81\'66 By definition, ecstasy is an ongoing on/off process. It requires a continual sequence of \u8216\'81\'65dropping out.\u8217\'81\'66 On those occasions when many individuals share the ecstatic experience at the same time, they create a brief-lived \u8216\'81\'65counter-culture.\u8217\'81\'66 Synonyms [of Ecstasy are]: Euphoria, [...] bliss, nirvana, rapture\u8221\'81\'68(PE 1). According to Leary, the \u8220\'81\'67psychedelic-cybernetic revolution\u8221\'81\'68 that started with the Beats in the late 50s in America is a revolution based on ecstatic states of being in which politics (\u8220\'81\'67the primitive struggle for power and territory\u8221\'81\'68) and ethical norms are transcended. This movement has been made possible by psychedelic drugs and cybernetic-electronic technology. According to Leary, this individual-freedom movement is new to human history because it is not based on geography, politics, class, or religion. It has to do not with changes in the political structure but with changes in the individual mind. It is a \u8220\'81\'67consciousness revolution.\u8221\'81\'68\uc1 }

They describe different levels of consciousness which correspond to different stages in human evolution. According to Leary, human evolution is an evolution towards freedom. Psychedelics and computers play an important role in Leary\u8217\'81\'66s vision of humanity\u8217\'81\'66s development towards this state of total freedom. By helping us to understand how our brains work and enabling us to activate the higher levels of consciousness (which have not been accessible to the majority of people in the past) they help to speed up human evolution. As more and more people are discovering how to activate these higher levels of consciousness - which are characterized by freedom from limitations and an endless number of choices that are open to the individual - we are moving closer and closer to the final stage of human evolution which Leary describes as \u8220\'81\'67the culmination of the mystical, transcendental, spooky, hallucinatory dreams which we have envisioned in our highest psychedelic (mind-opened) states\u8221\'81\'68(PE 2).\uc1 }

+In the 70s, only very few people had access to computers and the Internet - which then was called \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67ARPA-Net\u8221\'81\'68 - was only for military communication (cf. Dery 1996: 5f.). However, it did not take long until this vision of a society in which all, or at least most of the people are connected electronically became reality. In the early 80s, the computer revolution moved beyond the esoteric subculture of researchers and hobbyists and became a mass culture phenomenon. In 1983, when universities, business companies, and government agencies connected their computers to the Internet, what had been the Arpa Internet mutated into an anarchic global network (cf. ibid.). \uc1 }

Like Leary, Rushkoff argues that what goes on inside any one person\u8217\'81\'66s head is reflected, in some manner, on every other level of reality. So any individual being, through feedback and iteration, has the ability to redesign reality. If you change, the world changes. (cf. ibid. 23). According to Rushkoff,  there are different ways to experience the fractal nature of the universe, or - to use Rushkoff\u8217\'81\'66s terminology \uc1 \u8211\'3f there are different ways to access Cyberia, or \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67cyberspace.\u8221\'81\'68 \u8220\'81\'67Cyberspace can be accessed through drugs, dance, spiritual techniques, chaos maths, and pagan rituals,\u8221\'81\'68 Rushkoff explains (ibid. 3), adding that,\uc1 }

+Ultimately, the personal computer and its associated technologies may be the best access point to Cyberia. They even serve as a metaphor for cyberians who have nothing to do with computers but who look at the net as a model for human interaction. It allows for communication without the limitations of time or space, personality or body, religion or nationality. The vast computer-communications network  is a fractal approach to human consciousness. It provides the means for complex and immediate feedback and iteration, and is even self-similar in its construction, with giant networks mirroring BBSs [Electronic Bulletin Board Services], mirroring users\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66 own systems, circuit boards, and components that themselves mirror each participant\u8217\'81\'66s neural biocircuitry.

Fore them, the \u8220\'81\'67hypertext-universe\u8221\'81\'68 of the Internet is only one manifestation of a mystical world where the limits of space, time, and  body are transcended. Rushkoff explains: \u8220\'81\'67Cyberia is the place a businessperson goes when involved in a phone conversation, the place a shamanic warrior goes when travelling out of body, the place an \u8216\'81\'65acid house\u8217\'81\'66 dancer goes when experiencing the bliss of a techno-acid trance. Cyberia is the place alluded to by the mystical teachings of every religion, the theoretical tangents of every science, and the wildest speculations of  every imagination\u8221\'81\'68(Rushkoff 1995: 5). According to Rushkoff, cyberspace, or Cyberia, is a \u8220\'81\'67place\u8221\'81\'68  (a  realm of consciousness) where we can create our own realities, a world where we can be anyone or anything we want to be.

+What Dery tries to show with this excursion back to the 60s is that, from a countercultural point of view, the 90s are really a  return of the 60s. According to Dery, the cyber-hippies of the 90s have taken over many of the values and beliefs of the 60s counterculture and integrated them into their worldview \u8211\'3f for example, the value of individual freedom and the belief that technology (chemistry) can help us attain freedom and enlightenment. Other ideas such as the ideal of living in perfect harmony with nature or Marx\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s program to improve the social and economic conditions in our decadent (i.e., capitalistic) society, however, would have been dismissed as irrelevant to the 90s. As far as the difference between the hippies\u8217\'81\'66 and the cyber-hippies\u8217\'81\'66 attitudes towards politics is concerned, Dery points out that in spite of the fact that many hippies were only interested in taking drugs, politics still played an important role in the 60s counterculture (the antiwar movement, the civil rights struggle, black power, the New Left, feminism). In contrast to the hippies, the cyber-hippies of the 90s do not care about politics at all.

Like Rushkoff, Leary believes that \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 is an arbitrary construction and that Western reason (Newtonian physics, etc) is unable to make sense of the chaotic, fractal, non-linear world we inhabit. Both Leary and Rushkoff present technology as something which is absolutely, 100% positive. They both see technology as an \u8220\'81\'67extension\u8221\'81\'68 of the human being.\uc1 }

Like McKenna in his Timewave theory, they both argue that the exponential acceleration of technological development we are witnessing at present will lead to unimaginable breakthroughs: \u8220\'81\'67downloading\u8221\'81\'68 (that is,  mapping of the idiosyncratic neural networks of our minds onto computer memory, thereby rendering the body superfluous), the nanotechnological assembler (which could help us to create machines that stop our bodies from aging), etc. Both Leary and Rushkoff advise their readers to prepare themselves for the \u8220\'81\'67great leap into hyperspace\u8221\'81\'68 that Terence McKenna predicts in his Timewave theory \uc1 \u8211\'3f a world in which all limits are transcended, a world of total freedom.

His arguments taken from scientists of different fields try to prove that \u8220\'81\'67downloading\u8221\'81\'68 is theoretically impossible (cf. ibid. 318).

+As far as the cyberian dream of \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67rising beyond the old flesh\u8221\'81\'68 (body) is concerned, Dery argues that it is dangerous to see the brain/mind as an object separating the body from the person/subject that lives in it. He wants to bring us back to our senses, to remind everyone of us that he/she lives in a body. Dery warns us that if we do not keep this subjective kind of body sense in mind as we negotiate our technoculture then we will objectify ourselves to death (cf. ibid. 311). He quotes cultural critic Donna Haraway who admonishes us that any transcendentalist ideology that promises a way of transcending the body (i.e., a way of denying immortality) contains the seeds of a \u8220\'81\'67self-fulfilling apocalypse.\u8221\'81\'68 Haraway argues that, \u8220\'81\'67[What we need, more than ever,] is a deep sense of the fragility of the lives that we\u8217\'81\'66re leading \uc1 \u8211\'3f that we really do die, that we really do wound each other, that the Earth is really finite, that there aren\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66t any planets out there that we know of we can live on, that escape velocity [i.e., the vision of a techno-mystical apotheosis in the there and then] is a deadly fantasy\u8221\'81\'68(ibid. 17). \uc1 }

Many cyber-philosophers (Leary, McKenna, Rushkoff, etc) were strongly influenced by McLuhan\u8217\'81\'66s work.

Consequently, the electronic media would reshape and restructure patterns of social interdependence and end psychic, social, economic, and political self-centeredness (see chapter 3.4.). Throughout his theories Leary uses McLuhan\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s ideas (especially the idea that \u8220\'81\'67all media [technologies] are extensions of some human faculty \uc1 \u8211\'3f psychic or physical\uc2 \u8221\'81\'68) to support the idea that technology can help us to liberate ourselves from all limits.

+McLuhan\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s historical account of the evolution of technological media was structured around a (medical) account of the evolution of technological innovation as \u8220\'81\'67counter-irritants\u8221\'81\'68 to the \u8220\'81\'67stress of acceleration of pace and increase of load.

+According to the Krokers, it was McLuhan\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s thesis that the motive-force for technological innovation was always defensive and biological: The nervous system tries to protect itself against sudden changes in the \u8220\'81\'67stimulus\u8221\'81\'68 of the external environment by using the physical organs (that is, the technologies which extend these organs as) \u8220\'81\'67buffers.\u8221\'81\'68 In times of high stress, humans always invent new technologies \uc1 \u8211\'3f that is, they extend, or \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67outer,\u8221\'81\'68 individual organs \uc1 \u8211\'3f so the nervous system can protect itself against the stress of acceleration of pace. But each \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67outering\u8221\'81\'68 of individual organs is also an acceleration and intensification of the general environment. So it seems that humans are caught in some kind of vicious circle. (high stress > we invent new technologies to protect the nervous system > acceleration of the environment > high stress...).\uc1 }

The environment changed so fast that \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67in a desperate [...] autoamputation, as if the central nervous system could no longer depend on the physical organs as buffers against the slings and arrows of outrageous mechanism\u8221\'81\'68(McLuhan 1964: 43), the central nervous system itself was outered in the form of electric circuitry (computers, the Internet, etc). In other words, the nervous system has gone numb. According to McLuhan, this outering of the central nervous system induced an unprecedented level of stress on the individual organism (cf. McLuhan 1964: 252). McLuhan argues that the electric age is an age of \u8220\'81\'67anxiety and dread\u8221\'81\'68 because we are unable to cope with this new situation; we are unable to understand the subliminal consequences of the fundamental changes in technostructure (cf.

It seems that Leary himself was under the hypnotic spell of technology McLuhan was talking about, when he praised the computer, the Internet, and virutal reality as cure-all for all problems on our planet.

In this paper I have shown that several important figures of the cyber-movement were strongly influenced by Leary (e.g., Douglas Rushkoff, R.U. Sirius, and Bruce Eisner) and that Leary was actually one of the founding fathers of the cyber-movement. As early as 1973, Leary predicted that someday the world would be linked together through a new \u8220\'81\'67electronic nervous system,\u8221\'81\'68 a global electronic communication network which would dissolve authoritarian hierarchical structures.

+ (1977), Leary encouraged the hippies to leave the flower-power 60s behind and find a way to live with technology which, according to Leary, could help us to free ourselves from all limits. In his Exo-Psychology theory, Leary laid the ideological foundation for the cyber-movement.

This \u8220\'81\'67higher\u8221\'81\'68 level of consciousness, the \u8220\'81\'67Neuroelectric Circuit,\u8221\'81\'68 was later interpreted by members of the cyber-movement as cyberspace or the Internet (see chapter 3.5.).\uc1 }

+Many people are surprised when they hear that Leary, the famous LSD-guru of the hippies, reemerged in the 80s as a spokesman of the cyberpunks, because they can see no connection between the anti-technology-oriented hippies and the cyberpunks who embrace technology. If we analyze Leary\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s theories, however, we see that there actually is a strong connection between the psychedelic counterculture of the 60s and the cyberdelic counterculture of the 80s and 90s. We see that the cyberpunks of the 80s and 90s were heavily influenced by the transcendentalism that prevailed in the 60s counterculture (see chapter 4.7.2.). According to Leary, the hippies of the 60s and the cyberpunks of the 80s and 90s actually belong to one and the same movement because they share the same aim: Ecstasy, that is, the experience of individual freedom. Leary argues that the individual freedom revolution started by the hippies in the 60s was continued by cyberpunks in the 80s. According to Leary, this individual freedom movement, which has country by country, continent by continent, liberated much of the world in the last three decades (e.g., the fall of communism in Eastern Europe), would not have been possible without mind-expanding drugs (psychedelics) and mind-linking electronic appliances (computers, radio, TV, etc). \uc1 }

+Leary was definitely right when he said that the electronic media (TV, Internet, etc) played a crucial role in the youth revolutions of 1989 which lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the resignation of the hard-line regime in Czechoslovakia. However, when Leary argued that computers, the Internet, and other electronic media have only positive effects (i.e., they create individual freedom), he was definitely wrong. In the 80s, when Leary wrote most of his essays on the cyberpunks and the Internet, it was not so obvious that the decentralization created by the Internet is a double edged sword, that it slowly dissolves old hierarchical political structures while at the same time empowering the powerful, autocratic, multinational corporations. The 80s were the heyday of the cyberpunk-computer-hackers, who dominated the Internet, cracking government files, etc. It was a time when anything seem to be possible because nobody really knew in which direction the Internet would change our society. Now, however, the cyberdelic revolution is over.      The cyberdelic counterculture which Leary helped to create is absorbed into the mainstream. This trip is over. The Internet has become a \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67playing field for a mutating corporate oligarchy.\u8221\'81\'68 \uc1 }

Dogma means stagnation, inflexibility, no choice, and therefore no freedom (cf. CC 232ff.). Leary argues that whatever you blindly believe in imprisons you. Blind belief is the death of the intellect. He compares beliefs to filters in the human perceptual apparatus which filter the information that is received from the outside world. This means that all the information from the outside world which does not confirm one\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s belief cannot pass the filter and therefore is ignored (see chapter 4.3.).

All \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67power-hungry control freaks\u8221\'81\'68 try to impose dogmas on people because they very well know that a dogma is a powerful instrument to create conformity and predictable behavior. In his theories Leary constantly alerts us to the dangers of dogmas and conformity (the Inquisition, the Holy War, the Nazi regime, etc) and tries to make us aware that there is no reason whatsoever why we should accept the dogmas that authorities are trying to impose on us. Again and again he reminds his readers that all dogmas, like all  scientific theories, are arbitrary constructions. He tries to make his readers aware of the fact that science, like all cultural phenomena, is socially determined \uc1 \u8211\'3f blinkered by the biases of the society that produced it and dedicated it to the validation of its own  worldview. While supposedly objective, science often aids and abets political ideology and cultural bias. Like the constructivists, Leary argues that anybody who claims that his/her belief system (model of reality) is the absolute truth is simply wrong. You create your own reality. Ergo, \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67think for yourself, question authority\u8221\'81\'68.\uc1 }

Dogmas are static; they \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67imprison\u8221\'81\'68 us, which means that they are not good for our personal intellectual and spiritual development. But what are the alternatives to dogma? According to Leary, the idea of belief can be broken down into two categories: \uc1 }{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5
+dogmas}{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5

+ meta-beliefs}{\scaps0\caps0\cf1\i0\ulnone\ulc0\b0\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs24\lang1033\loch\f5
+, which are relative beliefs (cf. ibid.). The idea of meta-belief is based on the constructivist assumption that \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67reality\u8221\'81\'68 is a construction of out minds. \u8220\'81\'67Meta-belief\u8221\'81\'68 means that you consciously program yourself to believe in something, knowing that your belief is not the absolute truth but a construction of your mind. It means that you are aware that your beliefs are programs in your brain which can arbitrarily changed. For Leary, it was not really important that we do not (or cannot) know anything about objective reality. Leary\u8217\'81\'66s aim was freedom of the mind, Ecstasy (i.e., the experience of freedom from all limits). Ecstasy, \u8220\'81\'67ex-stasis,\u8221\'81\'68 is the opposite of \u8220\'81\'67stasis\u8221\'81\'68(which means that you have a static worldview). According to Leary, in the mind there are no limits except those that you set for yourself. \u8220\'81\'67You can change and mutate and keep improving. The idea is to keep \u8216\'81\'65trading up\u8217\'81\'66 to a \u8216\'81\'65better\u8217\'81\'66 philosophy-theology,\u8221\'81\'68 Leary writes (CC 234). As John Lilly put it, \u8220\'81\'67In the province of the mind, what is believed to be true is true or becomes true, within limits to be found experientially and experimentally. These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind, there are no limits\u8221\'81\'68 (Lilly 1972: xvi).\uc1 }

+Philosophers who encourage people to think for themselves, question authority and create their own religion/politics have always been considered to be dangerous, heretical, immoral, blasphemous by law-and-order fanatics. Socrates was one of these philosophers who was accused \uc2 \u8220\'81\'67by conservative minds of the dangerous game of discomfiting all authority before a circle of impressionable youths and subtracting from the state the stability of tradition [...] his unsettling effect on the young and his persistent criticism were intolerable to any establishment\u8221\'81\'68(Harkavy 1991: 531). Leary is the Socrates of the Information Age. In our age there are very few philosophers (e.g., Paul Feyerabend, or   Robert Anton Wilson) who carry on the Socratic tradition of encouraging people to think for themselves and question authority, their own authority included. Leary was perhaps the most enthusiastic of these humanistic philosophers. \uc1 }

+Like Socrates, Leary tried to make people aware that what we accept as objective reality is only a construction of our minds and that the only way to realize our true selves is to question everything we have learned from our parents, teachers, politicians, etc (cf. ibid.). Socrates\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66 method to make people think about unquestioned \u8220\'81\'67truths\u8221\'81\'68 was asking them questions until they themselves realized that they actually \u8220\'81\'67knew nothing\u8221\'81\'68 (in the sense of absolute knowledge). This is what Socrates called the \u8220\'81\'67knowledge of not-knowing\u8221\'81\'68(cf. ibid.). Leary\u8217\'81\'66s method was to confront people with his provocative theories which were intended to make people question the models of reality that authorities imposed on them, and to encourage people to create their own (funnier, sexier, more optimistic) realities. Technology (computers, LSD, etc) would help us to liberate ourselves from authority and to create our own realities. \uc1 }

Furthermore, many of Leary\u8217\'81\'66s arguments involve contradictions and often he quotes somebody without giving the source of the quotation, which can drive a serious critic crazy. Leary, however, did not seem to feel embarrassed about the inconsistencies in his theories.

People who believe exclusively in a linear straight forward way of thinking cannot understand Leary. You cannot control someone you do not understand because you are just not able to predict the person\uc2 \u8217\'81\'66s next thought/action - and so, I believe, Leary has achieved at least one of his objectives: to be uncontrollable.  \uc1 }

Leary never grew tired of pointing out that politicians, priests and (most)  scientists try to make people believe in the idea of stability because they want to remain in power. They  try to impose a static worldview on us because they know that you can control a stable, predictable system, but there is no way to control a chaotic system that is continually changing. According to Leary, this is the reason why the government is against psychedelic drugs.

+Marriage is perhaps the best means possible to understand ego conflicts and religious attitudes.
+
+First, we must establish a concept of the origin of marriage. Marriage arrises in all cultures; I put forth the theory that the fundmental reason is simple to understand:  Sexual intercourse lasts 1 hour, yet the responsibility of raising a child lasts 25 years.  It is this equation, one hour of sex - lifetime of child rearing... that had each culture formalizing marriage as an education system / a teching tool.
+
+From that perspective, that marriage is a teaching tool of elders to youth - to not just have sex without responsibility to the child that is produced... that you could judge modern divorces as an educaitonal disaster. The entire wealth of human history has bene toosed away on the subject, in favor of for-profit lawyers and a dubvious goverment attempting to mitigate such a fundmamental failure of educaiton and learning.
+
+The 2012 Iran fim A Seperation and the correspening review from Chicago's Roger Ebert is one of the best artistic illustrations of this failure. Here you have a child, symbolic perspective, of not understanding how a couple can be so foolishly divided by ego and non-communiations.
+
+The society has failed to educate them that sexual intercourse responsibility is a lifetime, not just a few years until it becomes emotoional or ego conflicts.  A goverment, be it Iran's or Untied States, can not teach Compassion and Love - and nor it seems can most of our mythlogically broken films, songs, and popular art on the subject of Love.
+
+Fundmentally, at the root of all this, is the absence of listening skills.  The art clealry exists, Romeo and Juliet are well known, and Tristan nad Isolde are at every public library - and one click away on the Internet - but do people listen? Do they listen to each other's divorce conflicts - identifying that the Ego is the major factor.  The person that they once held in high value is suddely the worst enemy.

+Metaphor for the Fundamental Teaching Problem of Religion
+
+A lighthouse is the teacher. Everyone stars at the lighthouse and is directed.
+
+If you view God as the Moon in the sky (not to take this literally please, but only for sake of education)... there are two ways to divide religion teaching
+
+1. Everyone stares at the moon and behaves as the moon directs in a nearly robot-like fashion. And the moon itself directs everyone and is a type of leader.
+
+2. Every learns of the moon, like a vocabulary or langage, like a song and a education. Then is to stare at each other, person to person, peer to peer.  Conflicts are to be resolved by using the vocabulary of the m
+oon, the perspective of thinking and observation from the moon, to work together in undertanding and overcoming conflicts.
+
+Now a robot is itself an interesting idea. A computerized logic and behavior. At the time of the older religions, no such thing existed. However, the moon and stars and suns, moved in the same predictable fashion as a robot.
+
+The problem becomes one of teaching style. Self-learning of the religion favors peer to peer perspective. Classroom, teacher-oriented instruction favors a more robotic and forced student.
+
+We know that
+   1. Military boot cam, even of atheists, works in this fashion
+   2. Many of our artists have their own vocabulary for the kind o results/disconnect they have. Styx, "man in the wilderness" is one such example.

+			Although the work may be fiction, the idea expressed to me expmlifies both the War on Terror and the War on Drugs that is dmoestic and external in my lifetime. ""The war, therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word "war," therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war." -George Orwell, 1984

+Insecuirty, not irrational, but all too rational. Born of experience
+
+  1. Waking up each morning knowing that certian aspects of your life initiate conflicts. Which for me, is paperwork
+  2. Trying to predict the entire day's budget of exhaustive work properly, trying to peer into a crystal ball of that day's events
+  3. The weight of guilt, shame and depression over past failures vs. land-mines you have to 
+  4. Various systeming deadlines, weather patterns, and such that you have to try and stay atune to. They can greatly inspire you or greatly trigger you.
+  5. Age and other long-term changes, and even your dreams pondering something you learned weeks ago - a realization or eureka that may destablize your views.
+  6. A "Social punishment" sceme that you generally dislike, one born not of truth. Such as how homosexuals and people from other religions or races have been treated. In-group vs. out-group. Even "black sheep" of the family that can exist in any of the Earth's cultures.
+
+THIS IS WHY People can not recognize the high-fuction autistic's intelligence and success with their lack of friendships and failed marriages. And few have sought out work like Joseph Campbell's on religion to have the vocabularly and self-awareness to be able to articulate it.  We have mostly been left with
+the family members, medical practitioners, and university-studied academics to try and describe it from the outside.
+
+Put simply, we are trying to balance the whole society - and squeeze between the ever changing cracks of what we see
+
+Timolthy Leary's equation of LSD brain barrier, subconsious exposure, to computing is precisely why so many autistics . Life is like a video game, we didn't really wish to have to play. In my personal case, I wish that mercy, love and compassion were far m
+ore better tools - and understanding and learning viewed as a mutual experience. For me, every day is learning, and the pain of some lessons is very high. Most often when it is people (warfare between nations) or interpersonal (marriages, divorces, families, etc).
+
+There are hundreds of books on autism, but no unified recognition. Joseph Campbell is a perfect example using the field of religion. Each society has it's concept of it, but really will not translate fro Buddha to Jesus. They will translate from French to Japanese but not deeper. And that is precisely the barrier problem of Autism. All these independent books cliaming to tell the biggest understandings of Autism - but really missing the points. Children are trying to be assimilated to the society, that's an objective of indotrination / expectation of society behavior. With the high-fuctioning adults - you are dealing with a lifelong of failures of friendships, family situations, and aspects of technical life.
+You can argue that the depression is a symptom of reaction and misunderstanding (being harsh about it, bigotry) and it's nearly impossible to escape.
+Like religious persecution (being out of your own religious in-group), homosexuality (in a unwelcome area of the planet), or skin color / racial conflicts (historic slavery).  These metaphors are not exagerations!!
+Autistics are often in exile from their own very mother and father, READ THE BOOKS!  Book after book is about a mother who can not seem to bond with her own very child! Seeking medical and proessional assistance due to this massive divide!
+All due to the mind, not due to an ugly face, missing limb child birth defect, or similar!
+Is it possible to have a mind from another planet? Isn't that the very metaphor of Jesus and Buddha, Martin Luther King Jr, Ghandi, and Malala?
+Yet those just trying to live everyday life are not able always able to articualte the experience of such deep conflicts with their own family, jobs and society, and the constant pain of it
+is previous in time, current, and anticipated rationally in the future!
+
+Frankly, autism itself had to swith to a concept of spectrum because so many people were arguing about the degrees of it. And this is also the problem with the autistic and the humans in his life - they seem to find it far easier
+to just dismiss it, to adjust the volume level from 11 to 9 and say it isnt' as bad as it seems - and to scold the person who can never seem to balance their Life. And has to live without
+the real best joys of romatic relationships - and perhaps even the joy of religion.  For me personally, I see so many people fighting over religion, it's a constant struggle
+to see "God" as the one escape. To me, it's instruction and education on not fighting "love your enemy", "love your brother", not just 1 hour on Sunday, but every hour of the week
+and well - it sure isn't easy for us, and why should you think it ever was easy?
+
+The group "autism speaks" uses advertising and markting and corruptive influence. By no means does it speak truth, it's often mothers wishing to heal their children.
+To ignore humanities greatest psycologists, such as Jesus and Buddha, and modern Martin Luther King Jr - Joseph Campbell, Timothy Leary -- all fully compatible with Carl Jung
+is to ignore how complicated and diverse the world really is.  Campbell can be quoted on ths directly, the concept of neurodiversity
+
+
+Stephen Hollar uses the perfect example of this when he talks about the artist by society. How the left and right fight each other, in a ideals war, leaving the non-greedy artist - the truth teller in the middle.
+I have seen autistics parody non-autistics as liers, who seek friendship at any cost, and their mocking of autism (
+
+So you are left with this type of equation constantly
+
+  1. Do I put the feelings of others at risk for my own personal needs
+  2. Does misunderstanding itself cause pain. When you are talking about a 3 month plan but everyone's listening is geared toward 3 weeks.
+  3. That life it iself uncertain, and in your view things are happening all over the world that are uncontrolled, yet you are expected to listen only to ones that favor your self - and to segregate. Segregation in the sense of races, groups, emotions. "Compartmentalization"
+
+Is all this a heavy weight to carry! Of course it is, as Stephan Hollar said - "it hurts like heck". And This is what the Autism books are saying.
+
+Of course, when facing a multi-year decision, such as a marriage path that resulted in failure. It overwhemes even people without Autism.
+
+you personally can take religion ideals very deeply. you see conflicts between people, even complete strangers. You read 20 movie reviews of the same cinema flick, and you find conflict everywhere. You read reviwes of a 20 year old film at the time of it's writing, especially futuristic science ficiton, and you see how receptive people were to ideas and each other. You see 8 critics from 20 years ago, and how the conflict evolves and changes.
+You even read about the religion wars, and how 200 years ago the attitude was toward a scientific idea - such as bacteria impacting the outcome of a surgery.
+Artists also express these same things (the film "12 Monkeys" uses that idea of bacteria in surgery of previous time periods).
+Carl Segan points out that a tree and a human share DNA/RNA aspects, and all evidence points to us evolving out of the same basic building blocks.
+Yet, that idea has so angered people and created so many conflicts for thousands of years. How can it be that living tree is similar to me?
+
+You take these deepest religion ideals - and you try very hard - to never hold hate. You become angry. You know frustration rather well, But hate is sustained. Hate is lasting, hate is a military campaign. Hate is organized, structured, orchistrated, composed, created, authored.
+Frustration, anger, these are far more spontaneous and perhaps unavoidable. What religion is good without true compassion, it it's literal meaning of shared suffering, and of course - true forgiveness.
+But you do start to hate systems, machinerly, logical platforms, and dogma and orthodoxy (often orthodoxy A conflicting with orthodox B).
+You, your own self, may not be flexible, but you don't make a religion of trying to make others *less flexible*.
+You know very much the value of flexiblity in others, and how necissary it is to your happiness. It is this very equation that opens your own
+compassion and understnading of Buddha and Jesus equations ("lvoe your enemy").
+However, things like systems - for me - advertising, marketing, tax systems - their impersonal demands you can develop a hate.
+Never do you constroct a plan of attack, violence or even a desire of negativity. What you strive for is truth, often at great personal pain. But you sure may write and speak a lot on the subject, and the general problem
+of institutions vs. individuals and how they can somehow seem to breed personal misery for those who don't make it to the top 20% and 
+are not cheered for their achevement.
+ 
+balancing these, of course, is imppossible. Unintended compromises bite at you, intended ones seem impossible choices.
+No monk or priest can do this, short of pure isolation in a monstary or on a mountain. How can you achieve it? Self-segreation, self-exile
+is the only path of an autistic?  I've personally failed two marriages with completely unhappy outcomes.
+As Campbell summerizes from religion, there is no life without Pain. Loss is part of the equation, and at least if you are going to
+take a trip into hell (social conflicts) you should speak Truth and seek real Love like a Troubadour artists. Even if you
+are the most unpopular artist in the city.
+
+To try to prepare people for this, to prepare your partner, you turn to thick volumes like Tolstoy's War and Peace, and Don Quiote. But
+really you wish they understand that for you, it's the full bookshelf, not just a couple thick books. And as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr' says
+there is nothing more frustrating or bewildering that good-will partners who do not take you seriously in understanding the path you are
+undertaking. You sure don't wish to forget love's joy, like Leo B so loudly proclaims from his pulpit. What's the point of a marriage,
+of such an ordeal and a path, if you never have fun and joy. If you only conflict, war - you are like a religion gone bad.  An autistic
+would never wish this outcome, or this journey. A Troubadour may embrace the pain of Love, but to have a marriage where Love never exists

+Insecuirty, not irrational, but all too rational. Born of experience
+
+  1. Waking up each morning knowing that certian aspects of your life initiate conflicts. Which for me, is paperwork
+  2. Trying to predict the entire day's budget of exhaustive work properly, trying to peer into a crystal ball of that day's events
+  3. The weight of guilt, shame and depression over past failures vs. land-mines you have to 
+  4. Various systeming deadlines, weather patterns, and such that you have to try and stay atune to. They can greatly inspire you or greatly trigger you.
+  5. Age and other long-term changes, and even your dreams pondering something you learned weeks ago - a realization or eureka that may destablize your views.
+  6. A "Social punishment" sceme that you generally dislike, one born not of truth. Such as how homosexuals and people from other religions or races have been treated. In-group vs. out-group. Even "black sheep" of the family that can exist in any of the Earth's cultures.
+
+THIS IS WHY People can not recognize the high-fuction autistic's intelligence and success with their lack of friendships and failed marriages. And few have sought out work like Joseph Campbell's on religion to have the vocabularly and self-awareness to be able to articulate it.  We have mostly been left with
+the family members, medical practitioners, and university-studied academics to try and describe it from the outside.
+
+Put simply, we are trying to balance the whole society - and squeeze between the ever changing cracks of what we see
+
+Timolthy Leary's equation of LSD brain barrier, subconsious exposure, to computing is precisely why so many autistics . Life is like a video game, we didn't really wish to have to play. In my personal case, I wish that mercy, love and compassion were far m
+ore better tools - and understanding and learning viewed as a mutual experience. For me, every day is learning, and the pain of some lessons is very high. Most often when it is people (warfare between nations) or interpersonal (marriages, divorces, families, etc).
+
+There are hundreds of books on autism, but no unified recognition. Joseph Campbell is a perfect example using the field of religion. Each society has it's concept of it, but really will not translate fro Buddha to Jesus. They will translate from French to Japanese but not deeper. And that is precisely the barrier problem of Autism. All these independent books cliaming to tell the biggest understandings of Autism - but really missing the points. Children are trying to be assimilated to the society, that's an objective of indotrination / expectation of society behavior. With the high-fuctioning adults - you are dealing with a lifelong of failures of friendships, family situations, and aspects of technical life.
+You can argue that the depression is a symptom of reaction and misunderstanding (being harsh about it, bigotry) and it's nearly impossible to escape.
+Like religious persecution (being out of your own religious in-group), homosexuality (in a unwelcome area of the planet), or skin color / racial conflicts (historic slavery).  These metaphors are not exagerations!!
+Autistics are often in exile from their own very mother and father, READ THE BOOKS!  Book after book is about a mother who can not seem to bond with her own very child! Seeking medical and proessional assistance due to this massive divide!
+All due to the mind, not due to an ugly face, missing limb child birth defect, or similar!
+Is it possible to have a mind from another planet? Isn't that the very metaphor of Jesus and Buddha, Martin Luther King Jr, Ghandi, and Malala?
+Yet those just trying to live everyday life are not able always able to articualte the experience of such deep conflicts with their own family, jobs and society, and the constant pain of it
+is previous in time, current, and anticipated rationally in the future!
+
+Frankly, autism itself had to swith to a concept of spectrum because so many people were arguing about the degrees of it. And this is also the problem with the autistic and the humans in his life - they seem to find it far easier
+to just dismiss it, to adjust the volume level from 11 to 9 and say it isnt' as bad as it seems - and to scold the person who can never seem to balance their Life. And has to live without
+the real best joys of romatic relationships - and perhaps even the joy of religion.  For me personally, I see so many people fighting over religion, it's a constant struggle
+to see "God" as the one escape. To me, it's instruction and education on not fighting "love your enemy", "love your brother", not just 1 hour on Sunday, but every hour of the week
+and well - it sure isn't easy for us, and why should you think it ever was easy?
+
+The group "autism speaks" uses advertising and markting and corruptive influence. By no means does it speak truth, it's often mothers wishing to heal their children.
+To ignore humanities greatest psycologists, such as Jesus and Buddha, and modern Martin Luther King Jr - Joseph Campbell, Timothy Leary -- all fully compatible with Carl Jung
+is to ignore how complicated and diverse the world really is.  Campbell can be quoted on ths directly, the concept of neurodiversity
+
+
+Stephen Hollar uses the perfect example of this when he talks about the artist by society. How the left and right fight each other, in a ideals war, leaving the non-greedy artist - the truth teller in the middle.
+I have seen autistics parody non-autistics as liers, who seek friendship at any cost, and their mocking of autism (
+
+So you are left with this type of equation constantly
+
+  1. Do I put the feelings of others at risk for my own personal needs
+  2. Does misunderstanding itself cause pain. When you are talking about a 3 month plan but everyone's listening is geared toward 3 weeks.
+  3. That life it iself uncertain, and in your view things are happening all over the world that are uncontrolled, yet you are expected to listen only to ones that favor your self - and to segregate. Segregation in the sense of races, groups, emotions. "Compartmentalization"
+
+Is all this a heavy weight to carry! Of course it is, as Stephan Hollar said - "it hurts like heck". And This is what the Autism books are saying.
+
+Of course, when facing a multi-year decision, such as a marriage path that resulted in failure. It overwhemes even people without Autism.
+
+you personally can take religion ideals very deeply. you see conflicts between people, even complete strangers. You read 20 movie reviews of the same cinema flick, and you find conflict everywhere. You read reviwes of a 20 year old film at the time of it's writing, especially futuristic science ficiton, and you see how receptive people were to ideas and each other. You see 8 critics from 20 years ago, and how the conflict evolves and changes.
+You even read about the religion wars, and how 200 years ago the attitude was toward a scientific idea - such as bacteria impacting the outcome of a surgery.
+Artists also express these same things (the film "12 Monkeys" uses that idea of bacteria in surgery of previous time periods).
+Carl Segan points out that a tree and a human share DNA/RNA aspects, and all evidence points to us evolving out of the same basic building blocks.
+Yet, that idea has so angered people and created so many conflicts for thousands of years. How can it be that living tree is similar to me?
+
+You take these deepest religion ideals - and you try very hard - to never hold hate. You become angry. You know frustration rather well, But hate is sustained. Hate is lasting, hate is a military campaign. Hate is organized, structured, orchistrated, composed, created, authored.
+Frustration, anger, these are far more spontaneous and perhaps unavoidable. What religion is good without true compassion, it it's literal meaning of shared suffering, and of course - true forgiveness.
+But you do start to hate systems, machinerly, logical platforms, and dogma and orthodoxy (often orthodoxy A conflicting with orthodox B).
+You, your own self, may not be flexible, but you don't make a religion of trying to make others *less flexible*.
+You know very much the value of flexiblity in others, and how necissary it is to your happiness. It is this very equation that opens your own
+compassion and understnading of Buddha and Jesus equations ("lvoe your enemy").
+However, things like systems - for me - advertising, marketing, tax systems - their impersonal demands you can develop a hate.
+Never do you constroct a plan of attack, violence or even a desire of negativity. What you strive for is truth, often at great personal pain. But you sure may write and speak a lot on the subject, and the general problem
+of institutions vs. individuals and how they can somehow seem to breed personal misery for those who don't make it to the top 20% and 
+are not cheered for their achevement.

+The way we measure each other
+
+Has radically changed. We have transformed the outside
+
+- Cosmetic makeup
+- Recorded voices and broadcast television has normalized unique acceents and voices
+- Spoken language travels now from city to city and region to region much faster
+
+It seems like we strive to be robotic, similar, Then we try to change clothing and hair styles and phrasing to be again unique!
+This has a computer metaphor, like this:
+
+1. 1970 Analog tape recording of music, digitized in .  This fake idea that "Tubes" sound warmer, and vinycl record with iperfections noise added are better
+   but all this ignores the very imperfection of the singers voice, musicial artists who pratice so much, etc. Jazz is lost, originality lost
+
+Not to say that I hate recorded music, I don't. Much like repeating chants or poetry (religion inclusive), I find it of value. But to fetish the singer
+to have dropped the 
+
+Same with food, familiarty of home bases to travelers to have their own food. 
+
+People did not have the free time, I am not glamorizing the past old ways as much as trying to point out that we DO Have the freedom
+and communications tools to organize. But we put advertising and marketing as our highest and most artistic achievement, if we can
+centralize sales at one shop - be the #1 brand, people take pride in being stock holders (increased wealth) at a cost to something else.
+This binary Socratic thinking is blinded, without a triangle viewpoint of Reason, that we go in little clicques and huddles of familiarty
+and strangers are segregated from us. Such self-segregation is how we identify our selves, like social economic gangs, sometimes multiple
+gangs peering for a common gathering (concert, film, etc) but not outside their group.
+
+Most dramatic is the complet failues of our marriages. Not due to any "values", as much as a complete lopping of the brain
+subconsious intimacy lost and never developed, exposed, or expressed except in times of total stress (suicide, anger, violence)
+and never flourished in positive.  So terror, fear, anger, violence and car accidents become the highlights of life, and the education
+system of what to turn the attention of the mind too. Funerams and famous deaths are the common experience, as weddings and even kisses
+are viewed as consumptive events and not inward rituals.
+
+We have removed the authority of religion, but thrown the entire subconsious educaiton along with it.  What starts as a single indivdiual, the story's central character of a religion (prophet) w
+ignroe the pattern.
+
+1. First the prophet has their individual realization / transformation
+2. Second, they become teachers, story told. Many do not have the social skills or circumstances. If a solder in a war has the experience, they can't take 7 years to explain it.
+3. Third, the witnesses / companions / assistants form a team to memorize and help share it
+4. Fourth, the story is peer to peer, person to person
+5. Fifty, death, end of the stry telleer
+6. Some period of peer to peer growth, person relaying the story in a organic fashion
+7. Militants and opportunists take over, associating them selves with the now-famous person. Claiming that violence, fighting, killing is quicker and the true intention. At this point, it's ll down hill.
+
+There is an unavoidable equation:
+
+1. Adult Love is eternal, takes forever, is a endless stairway or ocean swim. Sex is quick, rewarding (children, pleasure) and easy to learn from the animals. Love, well, the animals can teach Empathy and dependency (like that of a child), but not of ending wars and compassion!
+2. Killing changes a brain's thinking faster. Terror, murder, fear - it works. The animals share that too. Hitting and caging an animal is something humans always had experience with. Sharing, freeing, living side by side with each other, something we are developing and have not yet achieved (heven on earth, not after death, Gospel of Thomas).

+My personal frustration is not that these words, ideas are new - it's our listening.
+
+We consider outselves so educated these days, as MLK Jr said, nd way back in 1954:
+
+There is something wrong with our world, something fundamentally and basically wrong. I don't think we have to look too far to see that. I'm sure that most of you would agree with me in making that assertion. And when we stop to analyze the cause of our world's ills, many things come to mind. We begin to wonder if it is due to the fact that we don't know enough. But it can't be that. Because in terms of accumulated knowledge we know more today than men have known in any period of human history. We have the facts at our disposal. We know more about mathematics, about science, about social science, and philosophy than we've ever known in any period of the world's history. So it can't be because we don't know enough.And then we wonder if it is due to the fact that our scientific genius lags behind. That is, if we have not made enough progress scientifically. Well then, it can't be that. For our scientific progress over the past years has been amazing. Man through his scientific genius has been able to dwarf distance and place time in chains, so that today it's possible to eat breakfast in New York City and supper in London, England. Back in about 1753 it took a letter three days to go from New York City to Washington, and today you can go from here to China in less time than that. It can't be because man is stagnant in his scientific progress. Man's scientific genius has been amazing. I think we have to look much deeper than that if we are to find the real cause of man's problems and the real cause of the world's ills today. If we are to really find it I think we will have to look in the hearts and souls of men.

+For which he undertook, the rest of his life, to be a dedcated teacher on that matter. But, of course, in 2016 we have iconized him. As Banksy said, turn a person into a statue in the middle of a town and people surely stop listening. The self-discovery is lost. Factory education does not work except in factory, robotic, behavior. Robot teaching method in, robot student out. This includes mosques, temples, churches, etc.  And Advertising being the most deep and influential human technlogy of educaiton and teaching.  To behave as colletive armies of robots, to allow the advertiser (the factory owner) to profit from te collective consumtpion of the advertising consumer.
+
+So, our listeig, and failing to see each other, look side to side, that 
+
+Even in Isalm, this is part of the prayer, to look side to side and sayto  hello. However, we have lost this and robotized it to a point that
+we are throwing coverings over hair and concealing words and not developing beyond the animals, but in fact, have less freedom to walk naked down the street
+than an animal!  We are not above animals, we are fearful and terroirzed - especially of being seen naked or speaking the wrong words, to be in
+psycological cages!  These viritual, hidden, cages we carry in our creative minds are constantly adapted. This is creativity gone horribly wrong
+like mechgnized warfare and factory killing!  We have destroyed ur individual selves in favor of the factory advertising, conformity, and compliance.
+This isn't peace, it's a computer with binary programming.

+
+"Getting back into that Garden is the aim of many a religion. When Yahweh threw man out of the Garden, he put two cherubim at the gate, with a flaming sword between. Now, when you approach a Buddhist shrine, with the Buddha seated under the tree of immortal life, you will find at the gate two guardians -- those are the cherubim, and you're going between them to the tree of immortal life. In the Christian tradition, Jesus on the cross is on a tree, the tree of immortal life, and he is the fruit of the tree. Jesus on the cross, the Buddha under the tree -- these are the same figures. And the cherubim at the gate -- who are they? At the Buddhist shrines you'll see one has his mouth open, the other has his mouth closed -- fear and desire, a pair of opposites. If you're approaching a garden like that, and those two figures there are real to you and threaten you, if you have fear for your life, you are still outside the garden. But if you are no longer attached to your ego existence, but see the ego existence as a function of a larger, eternal totality, and you favor the larger against the smaller, then you won't be afraid of those two figures, and you will go through."
+
+Again, repeating that until it is fully assimilated in your mind. Backwards and fowards.  This has been misunderstood by so many througout the history, don't underestimate how important it is to not get tangled and see the central point.
+
+Going past fear is exactly what the teaching is saying. 
+
+1. Advertising fear is to show happy people and to breed insecurity. In Western tradition, this is well known, how adam/eve became of ashamed of their individual sexuity and covered their self in clothing. To sell fashion, makeup, cosmetics, breast augmentation, fashion accessories, shoes, backpacks, etc - build on the same psycology known in the Adam/Eve story. Except instead of educating people on how to break the pattern, the anti-pattern, you constantly show the superiority of high expensive profit-making for the rich and wealthy owners of the Logos, Brnds, Trademarks, and so forth.  Seasons of the earth are similary adopted, and negative fear of being out of fashion is the desire otucome of the advertising. To be seen in 1970's clothing in 2015 only when approved by the pupiteers who better understand Adam/Eve psycology than the peer to peer individuals.  Turn the prisoners against each other in their minds, criticizing and looking away from the unkempt, outcasts.
+
+2. Drmatic acts of public execution, punishment, and televists shootouts and arrests. Do you ever hear the Television News say that the problem is that love and compassion fail us? Is compassion a word you hear every night, nothing it's absence! No, you hear thta law, order, control systems, anti peer to peer. To again breed insecurity, domination, power strutures, top-down perspective inside the mind. To repeat this like poetry night after night.  The very people speaking he news make more money and more personal power (fame, influence) through doing a better job of enslaving the listener.  The content of the story is constantly measured for higher ratings, acceptance, feeding the ego. Go back again to the Campbell quote, ego is a key thinking of Religion education, to not be ego-controlled by the mind. Yet, when you do not see this education and teaching systm applied on the evening news - your religion teachers have failed you. As they too use factory teaching techniques, convicing you of the ego interpretation anti peer to peer view of religion.  Holy leaders and their special hats are militry uniforms.  The television anchor desk and interview chair are the power pulpits.
+
+As the Funding Fathers of the United States also declared with their "Eye of Reason" - there is no substitute for authentic peer to peer.
+
+Is it incredibly difficult and hard! YES!!! But we have more electronic printing presses, teaching tools, and libraries and human beings in all of world history.
+At some point, when do we focus on learning authentic peer to peer, as was the very ORIGINS of our famous religious teachers ( prophets ).
+All along this message has been here, and we are living in the wasteland of avoiding it as 'too difficult'.
+
+For me, what I find difficult is the way we live now!  So much conformity and puppet strings. Behaving like a robot seems incredibly difficult to me, as computing logic has zero compassion, forgiveness and love.
+
+These problems can not possibly be overstated. They are so ingranted as positives, as tradable goods, that the misunderstanding so established and accepted.  Simple robotic behavior, organized and structured, is easier to the mind. THis was known, and we have weaponized it.  We have let braodcast, mass printing, etc be used to weaponize it. And tools like Social Media people are doing it peer to peer, speaking non-truth of only what the Ego wishes people to see - the fashion consumption, the conformity, the non-mistakes - and rush to the legal system, delete button, and unfriend button when real truth of total humanity comes out!  This is EXACTLY what Campbell is saying!  Re-read the quote!  To underestimate this understanding and viewpoint is to fail to see how successfull easy answers of conformity have been througout history!
+
+Yet, time and time again, a small number of individuals re-discover the original meaning. We can dust off the old books in our library and find individuals like Dante, who see WHY these stories had to be so commplicated. Because that's the truth of our brains,
+of a real peer to peer world, the Garden IS COMPLICATED!  And to be outside the garden, to use terror, fear, insecurity and conformity is quicker and easier to teach in factory fashion.
+
+how can we consider ourselves educated, and happy, when we know what is going on with the total earth? To just associate with an in-group. Adam/Eve, for example, aren't in group and out, we are all the same
+but this difficult idea/metaphor is the one we keep discounting.  Instead, we prefer to fight national boundries, geographic boundries, skin colors, economic lines, etc
+
+It isn't capetlissm, communish, socialism - it's Love Compassion and Forgiveness that our our most powerful human tools!  yet, we fight against these tools
+when they have Eternal abudance in their very education roots. They are metaphors for things that literally make us all happier
+and we fight here over crumbs that only leave us starving.
+
+This is the central words of MLK JR:
+
+"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
+
+Here, he is saying, we must peer to peer first and foremost, not be adjusted until we are All People Equal. If a person mistakes, terror or fear surfaces, one is robbed or mudered, we let
+forgiveness and compassion heal it - not falling into the trap of the cycle of a small number controlling the large.
+
+It may seem mindless slaves to Love, but it isn't. It's a higher education that only history books show. Animals don't have our educaiton system
+of books, of telescopes and microscopes. it's only possible with our more DEVELOPED view to create and author Compassion and Love.
+What's broken is our factory approach to education. The Prophets of all the Earth, did not use Factory education. It is out of deep personal
+listening that they realize that the brain itself is acting out a internal bi-poloar behavior, that what we hear and see is not properly
+understood.  An in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this has been spelled out to us for a very long time.  And as Campell is sayig, this is
+the very meaning of the gurdians of the gates of Eden.

+Autism's Truth
+
+IT's important to realize the experience of autism is not scientific.
+
+What it FEELS LIKE to Live in an Autistic Mind is not what it feels like to read a DNA report printout or to study DNA under an electron microscope.
+
+The outside view is a shallow view. Because inside ever human subconsious, dreams and Myths, we have this essential understanidng. Our failure is to not associate
+WHY religious leaders teach forgiveness, compassion as the proper answer to conflict. Instead, we keep trying to force autistic
+behavior to fit our factory conformity.
+
+The book, Essential Difference Male and Female mind...
+
+Fits right with Joseph Campbell's principal conflusion, as he said at age 82 in 1986:
+
+"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
+
+yet, science tries to run around, and bookshelves full of autism - that refuse to recognize the exepreince of  lviing in a mind, the expereince of sharing poetry
+on how it feels to live life - with the 
+
+By having a society so robotically ridgid and arbitrary - as each on earth currently is in many ways, an Autistic can not be free nor understood.
+Interepreted through a logical binary thinking, ignoring dreams and Myths triangle perspective, it's conflict after conflict.
+
+The outsider observer does not consider hormone cycles and wishes to force drugs and medicines to cram the hormones into society conformity.
+Instead of learning, and accomodating - there is a massive tendancy - an almost absolute reactionary trend - to smash the mind of the autistic
+into submission.  Much like Homosexuality was treated with a person like Alan Turing - by the systemic logic of his society peers.
+
+Robotic behavior seems easier. As does war and killing. A single bomb can kill millions in minutes. It is easy! The weapon was far easier to build and deploy
+than Eden on Earth ever has been!  yet, we marvel at our power - and our high educations - and have failed to listen to the voices of Dante, Campbell, etc.
+
+It could never possibly be repeated too many times:
+
+"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
+
+Psycology would interpret the opening of the heart, compassion, the Myth commonality inside the mind, as:
+
+- "co-dependence"
+- "Transferance"
+- "Identity crisis"
+
+Doctors strive to maintain secrecy between patients, confidentiality. They very opposite of religion, which are the most printed books
+in society! Doctors act like military, an eliate few who tell others what it means, the very opposite of "oepn source" in computing
+and the very opposite of Democracy as defined by the American ideal of Reason.  Military secrecy is power, and military is power.
+These can not be over-emphasized in the popularity and success of these shallow viewpoints.
+
+Artists are elnslaved by fame and greed. They are not seen as tools of 100% of everyone else, as music to dance by peer to peer
+they are seen by the Fear Authority, a military ruler thinking, to be enslaved by Fame and Greed. They want to be counted on selling
+the immeasure, the 20 year later dance and heart opening, can not be counted on the top selling albums list of 1978!
+
+The focus on short-term gain is the military appraoch. A gun changes a brain in seconds, fear and terror work very quickly in their
+educaiton. A Dog can witness another animal with it's eyes being beaten - and get the message very easily.  Whereas, the message
+of the complex view of poetry in Adam and Eve - isn't so quick, and factory teaching and it's conformity
+
+Ao the Autistic's peers are constantly trying to apply short hatcheting of the behavior. To carry a gun to fight back. Chemical drugs,
+and longer-term things such as "cognative behavior therapy".  Reprogramming the mind, instead of learning from it.  This one book
+spells out exactly what campbell was saying:
+
+"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
+
+And further, an Autistic fits Campbell's descrption of how a Shaman is developed;
+
+
+--
+
+"Since the inspiration comes from the unconscious, and since the unconscious minds of the people of any single small society have much in common, what the shaman or seer brings forth is something that is waiting to be brought forth in everyone. So when one hears the seer's story, one responds, "Aha! This is my story. This is something that I had always wanted to say but wasn't able to say." There has to be a dialogue, an interaction between the seer and the community. The seer who sees things that people in the community don't want to hear is just ineffective. Sometimes they will wipe him out."
+
+And, of course, autistics are surpressed - trying to be cornered, confined, restricted - wipped out.
+
+Ideally everyone would open up to their subconsious. Autism not viwed as an epedimic, but a healthy more balanced viewpoint in which
+the real problems are removed; violence, fear, terror.  Just like religious terrorist, military terrorists, threatening the world with
+ICBM's and swords alike - violence is the real common problem - but are we listening to Leo talk about his experience with child development
+and how the child wanted to smash Mommy and Daddy? This one child was articulate, not all have the worlds and the listening Leo!
+
+Alas, do we need to have each individual speak it, when it was told to us right in our religions?  It was there, all along, in our educations
+but we have let the military violence-controlling perspective de-emphasizes compassion, forgiveness, and adam/eve ('one parent for all humanity') perspective?
+Again, our listening peer to peer and to the message of "look higher" (to heaven) and not to the Castle high or the Fear high. But even a higeher
+education than fear and terror - and advertising's immediate profit-return.
+
+Eternity means, look so long you see everything.
+Heaven means, higher educated viewpoint - so high that you see everything.
+
+Don't be shallow and short-sighted. Forgiveness, Compassion - these come from education. Religion born of books and speakers, oral tradition.
+Not something a pig, dog, or cat can scratch together in George Orwell's Animal Farm fashion.
+
+To declare religion "dumb' it to say "music and poetry" are dumb.  It is a psychological deflection, a dismisall, of the ego. What's dumb
+is our approach to Autism, and our use of advertising psychology and how we believe it's the highest form and most important method of
+education.  No, it's a few people segreating the others. Like military leaders who have all along turned men into mechanized warriors - who
+wish every one to rush into battle to service death and destruction.  We admire and label these people as heroes. We are saying that
+their system of thinking, like an Animal Farm, is the best.  And we have let them turn religion hippies into Action Heroes by 
+telling us to not read poetry and poetry.  But as historical fact and conquest education books.
+
+Campbell:
+
+"Every religion is true one way or another. It is true when understood metaphorically. But when it gets stuck to its own metaphors, interpreting them as facts, then you are in trouble."
+
+And I think the same can be said of Autism. If a brain operates with a different clock, don't smash that brain's clock. Learn, find out what
+disharmony there is - sounds, stimulation, etc.  And you may suddenly realize that your very education system is not in harmonly with truth.
+That advertising and factory classrooms are conformity machines, military training grounds, and so has become youre very methods of
+funding artists.
+
+God is not an artist to fund, he doesn't need us. We could learn from that understanding. Like William Shakespeare, it isn't about
+being remembered - or even the recorded film of the actor's performance. IT's the story, our own self, and not to fetish the actor or the author
+but to see it peer to peer - in every Romeo and Juliet we encounter.
+
+repeating:
+"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
+
+
+My mind is repeating it, my own self, so I'm repeating it to you.  I am, not being a robot, I'm being a human! And not afraid to repeat due to superficial views.
+Until the wars stop, until we get a far greater harmony of individuals peer to peer, it needs repeating!
+
+"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
+
+As Campbell says:
+
+"That's what a meditation is. Meditation means constantly thinking on a certain theme. It can be on any level. I don't make a big split in my thinking between the physical and the spiritual. For example, meditation on money is a perfectly good meditation. And bringing up a family is a very important meditation. But there is an alone meditation, when you go into the cathedral, for example. [] Prayer is relating to and meditating on a mystery."
+
+the mystery, as I'm encouraing you to see, is MLK's viewpoint, how far can we go in compassion?
+
+"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
+
+I see no mystery in war and military logic. I see predictable non-mystery and "sensible" outcomes that people have settled their eyes on. Heaven and Eternity removed from from poetry, and the sight of each other as individuals.

+As an Autistic, this statement fits exactly the experience iwth family and friends, who refuse to educate for non-profit means, such as Autism. In a profit oriented factory educaiton system, you do not learn what is unprofitable. Autistics are so difficult, it's just easier to eliminate theem from your life. And the life of an Autistic is isolated, by very definition. The marriage (lack of) and divorce rates
+show that people don't care about soul and spirit of a person, they care about their predictable behavior. Which Autism slants toward the unpredictable.  yet, the same spirit and soul exists, but is not the topic of factory edcuation.
+Factory education enslaves, and does not open to peer to peer distinctions and grwoth into the Garden.  So an Autistic's life with family and friends is a "nightmare of errors", not a comedy.

""The war, therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word "war," therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war." -George Orwell, 1984

+-------------
+
+The Police, Miltary, and the Psycologist are all trying to heal the personal denial of the individuals.  This is a failed structure.
+War can not be organized, orhistrated, educated.  No, educaiton needs to be beyond animal murder and killing sport.
+Hunting for sport, military conflict, or killing for defense - military conflict - is just a sophisticated technological application of animal behavior.
+Animals do not create poetry, moon landings, and Mythology. Love and Compassion are the technlogy of humanity, not ICBM's and Nuclear Winter.
+To ignore the impact we have on each other, peer to peer, negatively - how terrorist can enslave us with fear and anxiety - is to also ignore
+how advertising and marketing can mesmerize (enslave) with promises of being #1 in your class. To purchase the right airplane to stand next to
+to and to wear the right brand-name fashion.  To try to dress as a Peacock to be seen.  This applied physiology against other humans
+is weaponized psycology.  It's military, not to serve the greater good, but to serve conquest and manipulation.
+
+A greater Good is Everyone, all the Earth. All the Universe!  That's always been the teaching of religion, those pesky difficult painful pages
+and people who say war is painful, death of their son is painful, do not see that Peace and ending War seems to be a greater pain!
+
+So Psycologist try to treat returning soldiers, but the real pain is in all of our denial that there should be no war at all. And psycologist
+won't admit that Truth to their wounded soldiers.
+
+And we rip those good pages out of our Mythology stories. The ones educating forgiveness, compassion as our strongest non-animal tools born
+of years of hard learning, experience, travel, pondering, meditation - talking communicating.
+
+I will kill your son in Uniform A because you killed my son and I wear Uniform B.  And even if the uniforms are removed, the terrorist shows
+they can blend in, in animal gurilla tactics, using th same mental logic. And we hold them as heroes on one side of a war, David vs. Gollieth.
+This is not education.  This is weaponized minds turned toward the ego.
+
+The real education can not be taught in factory classrooms like military boot camp.  Rice farmers educated to be murders with uniforms and teachers.
+Corn farmers educated to be murderes by unfiforms and teachers.  Terror is easier to teach, less painful, and quicker than Forgiveness and Compassion for All.
+The promise of heaven has been to focus on a few, on "our side". The ego aspect of thinking, of I vs. others.  The applied popularity of Team Sports.
+
+it's easy to teach military because the animals are already showing us survival. We are already killing living plants and animals to eat.
+We are given this education as soon as we ae weened off the breast, of a mother who is killing plants and animals.  To deny this truth is to
+deny that we already know to kill and eat. That the teeth and the mind are telling us the facts.  That war feeds from all over the globe
+and informing our minds that marriage fighting and war fighting are both bad.
+
+Yet, we accept them. Somehow we find a way to keep saying: It's more painful to use Forgiveness and Compassion for All - so let us segregate
+and take teams - and threaten each other!  To use terror and fear as our controlling collective power.  To all live under fear of map lines, passports
+clothing, etc.  And advertising and marketing constantly reminds us of who is above us, the owners who paid for those advertisements. And our aritsts
+can't wait to be famous and rich.
+
+"The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little."
+
+he does not hape people, he hates a system that promotes conquest, war, and factory education.  Anti peer to peer, anti individual, and anti Compassion and Forgiveness.

 For me, what I find difficult is the way we live now!  So much conformity and puppet strings. Behaving like a robot seems incredibly difficult to me, as computing logic has zero compassion, forgiveness and love.
 
+These problems can not possibly be overstated. They are so ingranted as positives, as tradable goods, that the misunderstanding so established and accepted.  Simple robotic behavior, organized and structured, is easier to the mind. THis was known, and we have weaponized it.  We have let braodcast, mass printing, etc be used to weaponize it. And tools like Social Media people are doing it peer to peer, speaking non-truth of only what the Ego wishes people to see - the fashion consumption, the conformity, the non-mistakes - and rush to the legal system, delete button, and unfriend button when real truth of total humanity comes out!  This is EXACTLY what Campbell is saying!  Re-read the quote!  To underestimate this understanding and viewpoint is to fail to see how successfull easy answers of conformity have been througout history!
+
+Yet, time and time again, a small number of individuals re-discover the original meaning. We can dust off the old books in our library and find individuals like Dante, who see WHY these stories had to be so commplicated. Because that's the truth of our brains,
+of a real peer to peer world, the Garden IS COMPLICATED!  And to be outside the garden, to use terror, fear, insecurity and conformity is quicker and easier to teach in factory fashion.
+
+how can we consider ourselves educated, and happy, when we know what is going on with the total earth? To just associate with an in-group. Adam/Eve, for example, aren't in group and out, we are all the same
+but this difficult idea/metaphor is the one we keep discounting.  Instead, we prefer to fight national boundries, geographic boundries, skin colors, economic lines, etc
+
+It isn't capetlissm, communish, socialism - it's Love Compassion and Forgiveness that our our most powerful human tools!  yet, we fight against these tools
+when they have Eternal abudance in their very education roots. They are metaphors for things that literally make us all happier
+and we fight here over crumbs that only leave us starving.
+
+This is the central words of MLK JR:
+
+"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
+
+Here, he is saying, we must peer to peer first and foremost, not be adjusted until we are All People Equal. If a person mistakes, terror or fear surfaces, one is robbed or mudered, we let
+forgiveness and compassion heal it - not falling into the trap of the cycle of a small number controlling the large.
+
+It may seem mindless slaves to Love, but it isn't. It's a higher education that only history books show. Animals don't have our educaiton system
+of books, of telescopes and microscopes. it's only possible with our more DEVELOPED view to create and author Compassion and Love.
+What's broken is our factory approach to education. The Prophets of all the Earth, did not use Factory education. It is out of deep personal
+listening that they realize that the brain itself is acting out a internal bi-poloar behavior, that what we hear and see is not properly
+understood.  An in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this has been spelled out to us for a very long time.  And as Campell is sayig, this is
+the very meaning of the gurdians of the gates of Eden.

+---------
+
+Modern technology has showed us what we really want. Complete enslavement of the artist. We want sequels to films, our ego craves the home theater with other pesky non-friend humans removed.
+We want to be able to pause the artist, to rewind, to enslave the presentation to confirm to our pre-conceived animal lust for consumption.

+is being sold and packaged. It isn't an education system of freedom, it's the pinicle alta vista of advertising and marketing! It's the golf-course
+retirement community of pure segregation from the youthful interaction of the school playground!
+
+We have been conditioned by marketing and advertising, in an ego feedback loop to expect:
+
+1. Blockbusters. To choose the POPULAR film. Because conformity and acceptance is sold through participation.
+2. Trailers and pre-conception, to pave pathways into our mind of expectations, of desire.
+3. To extend this into our homes, to seperate the difficult human beings who sit next to us in seats, in favor of factory-produced machines
+   and on-demand digital personal delivery.
+4. To not prepare in ritual, bathroom and such, but to pause and let our artist be interrupted
+5. Hold copyrights and trademarks to ensure that the future generations can profit from the blockbuster reputation.
+
+
+It's like asking a band to stop playing in the middle of a dance so just one person can go to the toilet!
+
+Does it support some special case, sure, and that is good. A handicapped person, etc. But shouldn't the theater technology be advancing to do the same, just as public roads and sidewalks should advance?
+
+But marketing and advertising is always pushing ego learning. Ego development. Self, me, look at me for what I own and wear and cosmetically apply.
+
+We have turned art, an ego subversion, into an ego grout. A weld that is even stronger than the material being welded. Artist who seek profit and fame
+are going to win. The bullet of the military approach of teaching, the ego logic of kill or be killed, applies equally to the artist.
+I'm famous, therefore my message has been understood.  Of course, real learning doesn't work this way!  We have had countless military
+leaders who are both famous and admired - but the fact they are teaching murder seems to have been principaly ignored and even outright
+overlooked.  Our corporate leaders are often no different. Seeking leadership through ability to enslave the masses, not in peer to peer
+education. They seek money, power, fame, control, wealth. Not for All, but for their teams. Military is really the ideal way to see this
+approach. And the same teaching paths have been given to our religious material.  The teachers are failing to see the outcome of their students
+and their own teaching technique.  Advertising, marketing, and square classrooms ARE the devil. If no compassion develops, no forgiveness

+retirement community of pure segregation from the youthful interaction of the school playground!
+
+We have been conditioned by marketing and advertising, in an ego feedback loop to expect:
+
+1. Blockbusters. To choose the POPULAR film. Because conformity and acceptance is sold through participation.
+2. Trailers and pre-conception, to pave pathways into our mind of expectations, of desire.
+3. To extend this into our homes, to seperate the difficult human beings who sit next to us in seats, in favor of factory-produced machines
+   and on-demand digital personal delivery.
+4. To not prepare in ritual, bathroom and such, but to pause and let our artist be interrupted
+
+It's like asking a band to stop playing in the middle of a dance so just one person can go to the toilet!
+
+Does it support some special case, sure, and that is good. A handicapped person, etc. But shouldn't the theater technology be advancing to do the same, just as public roads and sidewalks should advance?
+
+But marketing and advertising is always pushing ego learning. Ego development. Self, me, look at me for what I own and wear and cosmetically apply.
+
+We have turned art, an ego subversion, into an ego grout. A weld that is even stronger than the material being welded. Artist who seek profit and fame
+are going to win. The bullet of the military approach of teaching, the ego logic of kill or be killed, applies equally to the artist.
+I'm famous, therefore my message has been understood.  Of course, real learning doesn't work this way!  We have had countless military
+leaders who are both famous and admired - but the fact they are teaching murder seems to have been principaly ignored and even outright
+overlooked.  Our corporate leaders are often no different. Seeking leadership through ability to enslave the masses, not in peer to peer
+education. They seek money, power, fame, control, wealth. Not for All, but for their teams. Military is really the ideal way to see this
+approach. And the same teaching paths have been given to our religious material.  The teachers are failing to see the outcome of their students
+and their own teaching technique.  Advertising, marketing, and square classrooms ARE the devil. If no compassion develops, no forgiveness
+develops, no risk-taking in service of Love - then education is just not working.

+-------------
+
+The Police, Miltary, and the Psycologist are all trying to heal the personal denial of the individuals.  This is a failed structure.
+War can not be organized, orhistrated, educated.  No, educaiton needs to be beyond animal murder and killing sport.
+Hunting for sport, military conflict, or killing for defense - military conflict - is just a sophisticated technological application of animal behavior.
+Animals do not create poetry, moon landings, and Mythology. Love and Compassion are the technlogy of humanity, not ICBM's and Nuclear Winter.
+To ignore the impact we have on each other, peer to peer, negatively - how terrorist can enslave us with fear and anxiety - is to also ignore
+how advertising and marketing can mesmerize (enslave) with promises of being #1 in your class. To purchase the right airplane to stand next to
+to and to wear the right brand-name fashion.  To try to dress as a Peacock to be seen.  This applied physiology against other humans
+is weaponized psycology.  It's military, not to serve the greater good, but to serve conquest and manipulation.
+
+A greater Good is Everyone, all the Earth. All the Universe!  That's always been the teaching of religion, those pesky difficult painful pages
+and people who say war is painful, death of their son is painful, do not see that Peace and ending War seems to be a greater pain!
+
+So Psycologist try to treat returning soldiers, but the real pain is in all of our denial that there should be no war at all. And psycologist
+won't admit that Truth to their wounded soldiers.
+
+And we rip those good pages out of our Mythology stories. The ones educating forgiveness, compassion as our strongest non-animal tools born
+of years of hard learning, experience, travel, pondering, meditation - talking communicating.
+
+I will kill your son in Uniform A because you killed my son and I wear Uniform B.  And even if the uniforms are removed, the terrorist shows
+they can blend in, in animal gurilla tactics, using th same mental logic. And we hold them as heroes on one side of a war, David vs. Gollieth.
+This is not education.  This is weaponized minds turned toward the ego.
+
+The real education can not be taught in factory classrooms like military boot camp.  Rice farmers educated to be murders with uniforms and teachers.
+Corn farmers educated to be murderes by unfiforms and teachers.  Terror is easier to teach, less painful, and quicker than Forgiveness and Compassion for All.
+The promise of heaven has been to focus on a few, on "our side". The ego aspect of thinking, of I vs. others.  The applied popularity of Team Sports.
+
+it's easy to teach military because the animals are already showing us survival. We are already killing living plants and animals to eat.
+We are given this education as soon as we ae weened off the breast, of a mother who is killing plants and animals.  To deny this truth is to
+deny that we already know to kill and eat. That the teeth and the mind are telling us the facts.  That war feeds from all over the globe
+and informing our minds that marriage fighting and war fighting are both bad.
+
+Yet, we accept them. Somehow we find a way to keep saying: It's more painful to use Forgiveness and Compassion for All - so let us segregate
+and take teams - and threaten each other!  To use terror and fear as our controlling collective power.  To all live under fear of map lines, passports

+The Artist
+
+The Artist does not seem him or herself as a Public Speaker. They do not have an education in the Public Dream. The Public Dream has
+been discarded by the society as an error. Carl Jung's work dumped into a volcano of history in favor of the Socratic interpretation paths.
+
+(Bring in zero emails from train to DFW)
+
+Wihtout self-awareness the artist accidently poisons the socitey. Much like climate change and CO^2 emissions were an unseen consequence. Hints that something may be wrong are ignored
+such as the raising tide of divorce and the growing seperation of wealthy. The artist finds record/film/museum distribution institutions as both exciting partners and 
+overlords. They wish immediate success at almost any cost to their art, including the horrible marketing and avenues that their art
+reaches the ultimate viewer.  They have completely given up on the control of presentation - to companies like TicktMaster on live performances
+and various cartels of music, film, book, software distribution.
+
+Electronic Arts is just as horrible of a distributor as any of the worst Music Industry record deals.
+
+Of course, the threat of labor unions - open source distrubiton - direct peering with the audience is there. But ignored
+And the banks, distribution cartels do not wish a peer to peer currecy, a thriving tipping system, nor do they want a model
+of "enough si enough" - how much does one artist need to be paid? Isn't $350,000 a year enough? The projects can be funded independetly
+of the artist's personal life.  Why not voluntary agree to a tipping limit per year? When has crazy ego and lifestyle served art?
+It is the bankers and the retirement stock market investment herders who are pushing the image of golf course jet travel retirement.
+The youth are told - wait, go to school, don't get Love!  Go to job, get money, don't get love!  Don't backpack and travel, dirty hippies
+did that - and they were failures.  Don't listen to those idiots, they don't shower or dress properly!  They don't wear our business suits.
+Oh yes, we have liberated you from the business suit, but not from our marketing and advertising.  As the golf course retirement dream,
+the paradise island of fantasy - the woman and power - fame and respect - we will make sure you constantly see those very few
+at the top, those most famous, and that your dreams are of that mathmatics.
+
+There are 5 famous artists this year, and you can be that one next year. That's the perpetual carrot that drives the entire herd.
+
+The legal system is simiarly corrupt as the artist. it serves corropt abastractions, a complex form of obfuscation and anti-democracy
+it pushes medical, it pushes insurance (in itself a self-defeating anti-individual abstraction), it pushes structre on everything.
+It buidls square walls and segregation, not openness and circles.  The pursuit o technojargon is like the priests before Martin Luther
+who insisted on religion in Latin, and only blessed interpretations.  Martin Luther converted the Bible to German and Dante free poetry
+to Italian - and were moral liberatrians. But our legal eagles fly only for the powerful, rich and established - they wish to be servants
+to Enpire builders - not to the concept of the Individual.  And they too, control the artist.  copyright, patents, trademarks - they
+know that an indivdual can not compete with a cartel organization - and they speak a language against the artist, of non-truth
+and deception.

+If you consider advertising an education system, which I fully and extremely do, their point isn't exactly invalid.  Their violence is a horrible choice, and I fully condemn it, but it is also important to reason why it happens. As Martin Luther King, Jr said "And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear?"
+
+> They view western education as propaganda that is corrupting their minds and limiting their religious beliefs by introducing false ideas.
+
+Put incredibly simply: We have FatPeopleHate on reddit but ignore the massive presence of the psychological (Edward Bernays) propaganda used by McDonald's and Coke-Cola. Neither company is selling new products that need introductions - they **repeat** advertising and color the packaging of their products for the sole purpose of manipulation of the psyche. They constantly change advertising artists and presentation of the product - measuring which one is most effective in convincing the consumer to hand over their money.  Their intention is profits - to manipulate the masses to purchase from a factory and put wealth (money) into the hands of the owners (in various forms). 
+
+Yet, I almost see nobody on reddit speak out that advertising has a measurable influence on the consumption of unhealthy foods. In particular, the over-consumption of terrible things like sugar water (Coke) and fried potatoes.  That scenes of happy healthy people are being used to psychologically sell products - when any serious consideration knows that the regular consumers of such products are not of this same physical appearance.
+
+These foods are not very good for health and designed to appeal heavily to the immediate taste sensations. They sell not because they are quality, they sell primarily due to the appeal (keep offering new products until you find one that the human brain can't resist) - to take money and mental attention away from other choices of food to consume.
+
+America has weaponized advertising *as an education system* and product placement (within films), etc.  In poor countries, this kind of thing can be imported rapidly and have dramatic impacts.  It creates jealousy, "bling bling" flaunting of wealth (look at the wealthy Gulf nations and their princes), and other behaviors that the religion specifically teaches as factors that create society tension.
+
+In America singing may be allowed in a Church, but in Islam there is no such thing. Even the introduction of radios, music players, has destabilized the religion. The technology of  recorded and broadcast music competes directly with the education systems of the religion (chanting and repetition of the prayer).  You will find this same thing with Elvis in America from Christians.  But with Islam, it's far worse, as you have no equal to Gospel music that slow down the impact.  
+
+It's not exactly irrational to say that the external culture is specifically targeting every person in the society for the sole sake of profiteering off the poor education and lack of preparedness.  Food technology is just one simple example of this problem, it gets far more complicated when you look at things like sexual practices and pornography sellers (which profits the internet website owners via advertising page views, again a small number of people who profit - and care only about the increase of their bank account balance).  Suddenly teen pregnancy rates start to increase, in a society where birth control often isn't even yet on the radar.  These kinds of things set off *big* emotional reactions. They have very large families in these traditional cultures, and everyone is going to talk when sex is discovered out of wedlock.
+
+FIFA has a massive influence on a lot of poor countries (in both the Americas and in Islamic lands). They flaunt wealth and all kinds of "bling bling" things - and are backed by a lot of the same food and luxury sellers.  Fast food sellers (including drinks) don't sponsor sporting events and the Olympics from the bottom of their hearts, it's a deliberate psychological manipulation to associate with healthy (extremely non-typical) athletes and expensive actors.
+ 
+All of this is done by individuals, it isn't government to government, it's citizen to citizen.  And that seems to be what they are attacking - outside education systems.  If you can't see that advertising, product packaging, sponsor logos, and marketing are "education systems" - well, maybe you just think they are magic fairy dust that generates profits. Because there is a ton of denial in America about Edward Bernays systems of education and it's negative impacts (making the rich richer, and the mentally depressed and poor obese is just one simple example).
+
+-------------
+
+Religion is an education system, a mosque is a school.  Campbell is your reference on all this. To keep arguing over these very simple ideas
+is to disagree without reason. It is to fight instead of actually learn. It is to resist truth! And people DO resist truth! There have
+been wars over religion books, including people who agree on the same book (Quran). To continue to ignore this very problem of
+people fighting and murdering over poetry books is to not see we are talking about your own mind, brain system.
+do not fall into "I am better than those people", this isn't about who you are or what part of Earth's geography or even the technology
+you use.  This is about educaiton systems. And advertising, marketing is an educaiton system too.  If this equivlance can not be draw
+if there is such an allegance to the popularity of a system (religion or advertising) then the problem will not be seeen.
+And things lay as they are, in darkness, wher.e it is "just those stupid people who hate".
+Dr. Martin Luther King Jr time and time again said - that's the very problem, the divisive thinking of "us vs. them" and not looking at
+the interaction - and what has changed both positive and negative in the interaction.
+
+Dr. King's approach to violeance was not the obvious and popular pattern of 1) Run away, move to another city. Don't travel to those areas.
+2) Fight back with force of ecnomics or with violeance. These are military and political forces.  He faught with psycology, education!
+But not subversive psycology of advertising, but with truth and light.  He was saying, in essence, that:
+
+1. People of diffeent races are equal
+2. Education systems at the basis of attitudes are not
+3. That Love and Compassion were falsly educated as "in-group" only. That Jesus' words had been maleducated, propeganda, to divide the races.
+4. Circumstances and timelines had created inequalities as we see them today, but we must change to heal future timelines.
+
+These very same things can be applied to Islam and American Advertising
+
+Falsehoods in advertising are hurting america. Our own denial is part of the problem!  We think overprized pharamasutial, prison populations, and obesity are strictly classroom problems
+but ignore the wealth-flaunting educaiton of our popular singers, actors, atheletes, corporate owners, etc. We do not view these as education
+systems!  Baseball IS an educaiton system! Singers ARE educating children! Films do educate and change society!
+
+Do people really think you sit in Mathmatics class and learn Algebra - and it is used that next week?  No, it may be used 30 years later. And the same with a film.

 			Although the work may be fiction, the idea expressed to me expmlifies both the War on Terror and the War on Drugs that is dmoestic and external in my lifetime. ""The war, therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word "war," therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war." -George Orwell, 1984

 			Although the work may be fiction, the idea expressed to me expmlifies both the War on Terror and the War on Drugs that is dmoestic and external in my lifetime. ""The war, therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word "war," therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war." -George Orwell, 1984

+1. You have serious players who are not the Grand Masters
+2. Grand Masters
+3. The Eclipse of the Computer Algoritm
+
+This is the same as military and Edward Bernays advertising psycology!
+
+1. fumble and be independent
+2. Soldiers march in uniform, think muscle memory - like the brain scans of Grand Masters
+3. Advertising consumers respond to the taste memory of a "confort food" and to the healty people images of the advertising.
+
+The brain exchanges the Hero for Self. The miltiary Hero becomes one's own self image in the mind of the individual. And you become
+a cog in the wheel.
+
+Factory educaiton.
+
+Shia and Suni, 99% of islam - factory. But Mohammad was no FACTORY learner, he was incredibly creative, on a scale far beyond average
+ he was not a follower, he was a author, a teacher, a philosopher! A Prophet is a super-philosoper - as their ideas are not only
+ creative and new - but also accepted by the society (so many speak to god, but are rejected; being only philosophers of telling their
+  story and view of the experience).
+
+If you are a musician mastering your instrument, sure! Walking without fumble, sure! But to memorize sex with a partner, to memorize talking without thinking (being a recording device), to memorize
+ to memorize being a mercenary killer soldier, reaction and anticipation patterns, for any war you wish?
+ These are the very paths of evil that Religion was speaking of. Mindless slave behavior to some small group of men, not to the higher God
+  who creates the far more complex world (including tempting snakes, fruit trees, and the Devil).
+
+Religion is not TEACHING you factory education, it is teaching you of both good and evil - not ONLY good!!
+Romans 11:32, and the story of the Buddha refusing his duty.
+It's teaching you how to learn from experience, how to read other books, how to innterpret. Not slave memorization of math and multiplication tables.
+  Not recalling memorized and practiced thinking.  No, the highest thinking - Love, Compassion, Universe - are not slavish in any way
+  and require a dynamic spirit, a pumping heart (not a stone heart), and other metaphors!
+  You must know the devil to not be the devil.  Not by avoiding the educaiton of the devil.

+Monomyth as a Sperical Encryption Key to the human brain
+
+I believe that metaphors can be related to fuse-blowing memories of pre-programmed myth.
+
+Myth being keys to cultural-specific icons, language, etc. And all the brain talents, such as dance, music, multi-lingual, autism/sevant,
+are exposures to non-restrained keys of generic or post-birth expressive development.
+
+the Monomyth is the key, if you could coidfy the sphere of the entire Bible, as James Joyce was doing and Campell
+expressed in Skelaton Key to Joyce's work.  As the review on Amazon stated, you start to read ALL BOOKS as The Wake.
+Just as I hve personally said that the role of the Quran is to read other material to Rajaa. That it is a tool of other tools.
+
+The TV series "The Code" uses a Church, an example of how artists were living and relating to the Monomyth - and were able
+to translate the "sound of the universe" as they heard it in their mind, to the construction of this particular featured church building.
+
+As Campbell and Jung say, all Myths have common themes that can be cross-referenced. A type of Rosetta Stone of a Monomyth can be created
+based on metaphors of each society cross-referenced. Devil, God, Prayer Day, Virgin Birth, etc.
+I believe The Eye of Reason, a non-binary value can be gated inside the mind - but most people these days, especialy computer
+cryptography thinkers and systems, are pure binary 0/1 inside their brain. But I imagine a trinagle logic holder of some sorts
+that could crack all known keys (like the theme of the film Sneakers). I have been able to create a virtualized pycological
+representation of this in my own mind for temporary periods and been able to peer into my own subconsious one
+and relate it to the symbols of my own culture (music from the Midwest I could deeply connect with) as Campbell describes
+that an artist can do with myth.  But my operating system training and understanding of software side of a hardware view
+(which is what consiousness, the perceived software perspective of a hardware brain) helped me recognize the significance
+of Campbell and Joyce creating a new myth - The Wake - and how Campbell has been able to apply much of the pattern
+from his own mind into the world-wide religions.
+
+Campbell himself had installed a type of meta-debugger that allowed him to peer into his own personal subconsious OS. he described his own
+as a light debugger, maybe a kind of user-app debugger as opposed to a harder kernel-mode debugger.  He used the term "slow burning rapture"
+in terms of his own personal mind.
+
+I think I tapped into the kernel-mode debugger, the Mystic one he describes, or "A Saint" one he describes in PoM.  But I had my yonng-age
+understanding of oprating systems that even Timothy Learly lacked, and surely Campbell lacked (hiw focus was on literate, metaphor of
+communications - not my personal metaphors of human interaction with binary machines).  The brain is NOT binary, that is clear to me
+but it surely had some experinece of cascading fuses like EEPROM being progrrammed.  I could see gates being burned
+and searching for Monomyth themes. For example, I would play a song and sense a pattern search of other similar songs
+that had the same Myth-chunking in a kind of b-tree or linear search.  Like trying to remember someone's name
+from a face.  But I also sense some circules had gone from left/right turns (A or B logic, binary) to a tri-state of
+infinate.  Like going from one data structure to another.  A self-awareness of Monomyth had developed a kind of brain defense
+system that you see depcited by the Nolan Brothers as a "hardened mind" in Inception.
+
+So i ould traverse into the song perspetive of the artist, seeing the perfect Monomyth pattern of the song (a 3 or 4 mintue song probably only using 2 or 3 of the Monomyth Metaphor chunks.
+Unlike say 20 hour True Detective + Interstellar 3 hours, which I felt almost hit on 70% of them or something - like 3000 Monomyth segments?)
+
+Pi describes a flat circle, but that's not enough. I feel the Monomyth brain key is a sphere. I don't know math enough, but is
+there some insane crazy number even a e=mc^2 magnitute beyond pi for a sphere? A Flatland kind of pi?  I expect
+it has soemthing to do with how a black hole feeds into big bang(s).
+
+Are there e=mc^2 dimensioanl fractals? That go more than just the expanding, but multi-dimensions like beyond Flatland?
+
+In Pi, the number never repeat. So that's like a super-duper Prime number. So existing ecnryption is built on Primes
+but that's not enough. The human brain, monomyyth sperical encryption, goes many dimensions further to where each is a kind of pi
+like number (think of Primes as Flatland, and MonoMyth sperical chunks as an order beyond Flatland - like Pi).
+
+perhaps Monomyth, our own brain, has i in it, imaginary numbers. They are metaphors of the mythologies. And all art, all myths, can reveal
+the chunks by cross-reference.  Like the church shown in "The Code" was built to hosue music notes.
+
+radar waves and return use imaginary numbers, so too does the black hole to big-bang traversal?
+
+Knowing the monomyth code would crack stock markets and weather patterns equal. And our hormone tables (offset by internal clocks).
+
+oh yes, star patterns of the southern and northern hemisphere are one of the monomoth keys. So we stand outside and we calibrate
+summer and winter ant some point in our mental development.  There are a series of perhaps 20 star patterns / light patterns
+in the Monomyth key. True Detective Season 2 had one.
+
+
+EDIT: Maybe triangle logic is wrong. The bees 2nd hour of "The Code" talks about Hex shape. Maybe intead of a binary gate
+there is an infinate holding logic gate (analog) of a hex shape.  So whatever flatland world digital computers live in
+a hex shape equivlant like a beehive honeycomb.
+
+Campbell said that he felt each symbolf of a Myth existed: "Myths primarily are for fundamental instruction in these matters. Our society today is not giving us adequate mythic instruction of this kind, and so young people are finding it difficult to get their act together. I have a theory that, if you can find out where a person is blocked, it should be possible to find a mythological counterpart for that particular threshold problem."

+but really came from some parental influence such as teaching, television channels at youth (to accept or rebel against), etc.
+
+Everything is poloraized, A or B, and sometimes A-Z, but bell curve distribution.
+
+Trolls are not considered mentally ill for attacking a woman videotaping a mailman she believes is a stalker. It id discussed
+how she is sick, but not the trolls.  The trolls are doing thwat the community desires, enforcing conformity and 'good taste' and
+'standards'.  Like the press does crtiiczing an actor, they think it's important to get low-quality films. But humanity is very low
+it's the consumption and non-thinking mind-blowing (chemical release) they seek. They hvae never had their mind blown in any real
+sense - they just mean excitement. They cry over stranger's cats who are being put to death, not with compassion, but animal empathy
+as everything is why they are here. A real cat down the street, hoemess, and a real human down the street, unloved - goes unnoticed
+due to the complexity. They have hyperdeveloped their very narrow social ability to type and interact. To develop acceptance
+and listening is something they feel is foolish. Back to mocking the geocities page. They do not seek information, they seek consumption
+and cliff notes in "tldr".he t
+
+The trolls attacking her - not seen as mentally ill. I'm not talking about community behavior standards, morality. I'm talking about 
+how the very topic of 'crazy' and 'mental illness' is being discussed - and how the woman gave her address as crazy - but
+the acceptance of terrorist and the acceptance of fear not being recognized as a mental choice. Living in fear, in screen-consumption
+is their lifestyle chocie in their view - as propeganda and Edward Bernays are not educated to them - and they would embrace their
+idea of dehumanized happiness.
+
+For a decade I thought they would tire and see how absurd their peer to peer hate and downvotes would come, But I have had to come
+to terms that I am far too idealistic. and as Rick Roderick had trouble facing of Baudrillard's message in 1993 - the appocolpyse already
+happened. The artists pathways were already well-oiled for the Apple alliance in the Microsoft heydays.
+
+The hivemind term is coined, to describe the conformity - but people like two religions, refuse to call it conformity and 
+punishment of disent.  They do not see that facists societies do not have uprisings, they wish to be ruled over and
+to have the social secuirity of predictablity. As Rick Roderick says - complexity is what they do not want - they want simple
+MEME behavior. They refuse to fork the very site, to create new communities - they want to be a hive crawling over each other
+for upvotes and karma points. Like Rick says of his kids, emotion toward a machine - Super Mario - that's it to them
+each other are machines.

+Advertising and Marketing
+
+We think we know it. Rick says this in 1993. We are so accustomed to understanding it we stop questioning it.
+
+Advertising is the same as Payday Loans, Car Title Loans, and Pawn Shops. We avoid the mathmathics of growth until the bubble burts. Killing those without education.
+
+People have been raised in HyperReality:
+
+1. Twin Towers of Islam. Fear & Terror. First tower of TV News of Fear. Second tower of hero of military soldier. The Terrorist is a soldier in a war, and the hero is a soldier. The hippie, the free non-money artist, is murdered by both towers!
+
+2. Computing, technology, Facbook. Parents already divorcd, grandparents divorced, divorce is sport of war inside the house. Love and Compassion were dead long ago. No marriage needed at all. No book reading needed. romatic coedy, ROMCOM, enertainment soapy operas. It's fun to ignore Leo B!
+
+
+McDonald's and urabru are telling us to forget love, and since we think it's cool, we have forgotten love. Love comes from education, empahyt from animals. and our education syste is marketing and advertising.
+
+It's not possible to be over-cynical! Overkill is not even close to getting attention!
+
+Is Rick says, the spectical of the prison, life outside Shawshank, is worse than the prison! We have let conforming to be worse than prison.
+A loveless hate of your fellow man, robotic behavior, has won! that's what terrorist want from us - to believe in the images and threats of fear
+and that's what we do!  The Simulation of war, the threat of war, has become bigger. Space war on movie is more excitement.
+
+Terrorism is the new prent, on the television. Fear is the childhood dream.
+
+Crossing the street, walking, driving in a car is real risk. I almost die every day. Cars refuse to slow down, people looking at their mobile.
+Yet terrorism is supposed to scare me? And people are afraid to talk about a film that is deep?
+I don't understand how people think this is Life. to be so shocked by car accidents, being hit crossing the street
+  or even a heart attack. If you listen to life, are awake, this are real!
+  What is unreal is the television news, strangers in car accidents. Fabricated fear.
+   Action films, car chases, super-reality.
+   watching a family cross the street. Watching a homeless person. This is real to me. I am drawn to it, not avoiding it.
+   Sports on TV, that seems not-real to me.
+   Global warming that seems real to me, I'm outside walking. I look at the weather before I go out, the data
+     I notice all the concrete and trees removed. Carbon comes from burning those trees and oil.
+     this is real, I have smelled gasoline, I understand it is dug out of ground and converted to a gas, I see the
+     gas come out of exhaust pipe. This is real to me, it wasn't done 150 years ago.
+   Denial of man's chang of the world is to forget personal computers were created in my lifetime.

+If you are a musician mastering your instrument, sure! Walking without fumble, sure! But to memorize sex with a partner, to memorize talking without thinking (being a recording device), to memorize
+ to memorize being a mercenary killer soldier, reaction and anticipation patterns, for any war you wish?
+ These are the very paths of evil that Religion was speaking of. Mindless slave behavior to some small group of men, not to the higher God
+  who creates the far more complex world (including tempting snakes, fruit trees, and the Devil).
+
+Religion is not TEACHING you factory education, it is teaching you of both good and evil - not ONLY good!!
+Romans 11:32, and the story of the Buddha refusing his duty.

 Campbell said that he felt each symbolf of a Myth existed: "Myths primarily are for fundamental instruction in these matters. Our society today is not giving us adequate mythic instruction of this kind, and so young people are finding it difficult to get their act together. I have a theory that, if you can find out where a person is blocked, it should be possible to find a mythological counterpart for that particular threshold problem."

+The Code applied to Mythology
+
+MonoMyth is Campbell's word, he just says "The Myth" informs, etc.  James Joyce coined the term MonoMyth.
+
+In The Code TV series, Jackson Pollock fractals. And the Boing airline example of fractals for Earth mountains.
+
+All these quotes are when Campbell was age 82, in 1986:
+
+1. "I think that anyone who has ever dealt seriously with religious or mythic ideas will tell you that we learn them as a child on one level, but then many different levels are revealed. Myths are infinite in their revelation."
+
+2. "Mythology is the song. It is the song of the imagination, inspired by the energies of the body."
+
+3. "Every mythology has grown up in a certain society in a bounded field. Then they come into collision and relationship, and they amalgamate, and you get a more complex mythology. But today there are no boundaries. The only mythology that is valid today is the mythology of the planet -- and we don't have such a mythology."
+
+4. I think of mythology as the homeland of the muses, the inspirers of art, the inspirers of poetry. To see life as a poem and yourself participating in a poem is what the myth does for you.  [A poem?] I mean a vocabulary in the form not of words but of acts and adventures, which connotes something transcendent of the action here, so that you always feel in accord with the universal being. 
+
+5. "They are true in different senses. Every mythology has to do with the wisdom of life as related to a specific culture at a specific time. It integrates the individual into his society and the society into the field of nature. It unites the field of nature with my nature. It's a harmonizing force."
+
+6. "The artist is the one who communicates myth for today. But he has to be an artist who understands mythology and humanity and isn't simply a sociologist with a program for you."
+
+7. "Now, the biblical tradition is a socially oriented mythology. Nature is condemned. In the nineteenth century, scholars thought of mythology and ritual as an attempt to control nature. But that is magic, not mythology or religion. Nature religions are not attempts to control nature but to help you put yourself in accord with it."
+
+
+And if you are Western, make sure you offset axis:
+
+1. "That is certainly not the god of other traditions. In the other mythologies, one puts oneself in accord with the world, with the mixture of good and evil. But in the religious system of the Near East, you identify with the good and fight against the evil. The biblical traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all speak with derogation of the so-called nature religions."
+
+2. "You see, religion is really a kind of second womb. It's designed to bring this extremely complicated thing, which is a human being, to maturity, which means to be self-motivating, self-acting. But the idea of sin puts you in a servile condition throughout your life."
+
+3. I once heard a lecture by a wonderful old Zen philosopher, Dr. D. T. Suzuki. He stood up with his hands slowly rubbing his sides and said, "God against man. Man against God. Man against nature. Nature against man. Nature against God. God against nature -- very funny religion!"
+
+4. "They say more about Deuteronomy than about women. The Hebrews were absolutely ruthless with respect to their neighbors. But this passage is an extreme statement of something that is inherent in most sociologically oriented mythologies. That is to say, love and compassion are reserved for the in-group, and aggression and abuse are projected outward on others. Compassion is to be reserved for members of your own group. The out-group is to be treated in a way described there in Deuteronomy."
+
+5. "Of course, in biblical times, when the Hebrews came in, they really wiped out the Goddess. The term for the Canaanite goddess that's used in the Old Testament is "the Abomination." Apparently, throughout the period represented in the Book of Kings, for example, there was a back and forth between the two cults. Many of the Hebrew kings were condemned in the Old Testament for having worshiped on the mountaintops. Those mountains were symbols of the Goddess. And there was a very strong accent against the Goddess in the Hebrew, which you do not find in the Indo-European mythologies. Here you have Zeus marrying the Goddess, and then the two play together. So it's an extreme case that we have in the Bible, and our own Western subjugation of the female is a function of biblical thinking."
+
+6. "In the history of Western religions, this is an extremely interesting development. In the Old Testament, you have a God who creates a world without a goddess. Then when you come to Proverbs, there she is, Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom, who says, "When He created the world, I was there, and I was His greatest joy." But in the Hebrew tradition the idea of a son of God is repulsive, it is not considered at all. The Messiah as the son of God is not actually God's son. He is one who in his character and dignity is worthy to be likened to the son of God. I'm sure there's no idea of a virgin birth in that tradition. The virgin birth comes into Christianity by way of the Greek tradition. When you read the four gospels, for example, the only one in which the virgin birth appears is the Gospel According to Luke, and Luke was a Greek."
+
+
+Equations and crossing other boundries:
+
+1. "The hunter is an individual in a way that no farmer will ever be. Toiling in the fields and waiting for nature to tell you when you're going to do it is one thing, but going off on a hunt -- every hunt is a different hunt from the last one. And the hunters are trained in individual skills that require very special talents and abilities."
+
+2. "When this big emphasis came on the settled village life, the shaman lost power. In fact, there's a wonderful set of stories and myths of some of the Southwestern American Indians, the Navaho and Apache, who were originally hunting peoples who came down into an area where agriculture had been developed and took on an agricultural system of life. In their stories of the beginnings, there is typically an amusing episode where the shamans are disgraced and the priests take over."
+
+3. "I would see three situations here. First, the early one of the Goddess, when the male is hardly a significant divinity. Then the reverse, when the male takes over her role. And finally, then, the classical stage, where the two are in interaction -- as they are also, for example, in India."
+
+
+Examples of complex Myths
+
+1. The entire 20 hours of True Detective. Has to be watched mutliple times (just like religion books) and the first season has to be viewed as educationa/metaphorical concepts relted to the second season.  Like Old Testimate vs. New Testimte (but really myth without death of hero, myth with death).
+    You have to take "picture is 1000 words" to film level, and realize how this is a very thick and rich poetry - like Finnegans Wake.
+
+It also requires a lot of American cultural symbols. For a cross-reference, a smaller Myth can be seen to assist in the structure
+    1. Pricetag song
+    2. Entire album from Styx: The Grand Illusion

+Popularity, Democarcy, Truth
+
+Dante and Campbell made a point about the non-popularity of truth. Surely others have made it.
+
+But to dismiss this issue, to banalize it as Rick Roderick describes it, is trivial. Including you reading this.
+
+A husband and a wife in child custody battle. I don't mean just ONE, I mean almost EVERY child custody battle. These people
+who were favorite, the highest order, the biggest type of friends - become the worst enemy.  To reduce the ego problem to this
+one pair - is the basis of a very valid and good learning technique.
+
+It is no coincidence that Adam/Eve are in the pair of the Garden of Eden.  To think it's only vagina and penis is to ignrore
+the very creation of marriage. IT CAN NOT BE OVERSTATED, OVER-EMPHASIZED, HAMMERED HOME - that wedding vows are unlike anything
+except military vows.
+
+Even in cross-islamic people forget that veils are worn by women in wedding ceremonies, as people mock women for wearing viels
+as foolish.  Not to say it might not be foolish for some reasons, but reason is not about mocking.  But if you forget the wedding
+viel - you have failed to connect with compassion and understanding. Education has divided you, not connected you to strangers.
+
+I can NOT over-emaphasize that wedding vows are promises:
+
+1. Far more than a Home Owners Association (HOA). As you can buy your way out and move away.
+2. Far more thna a Non Competition Agreement and Non  Disclosure Agreements (NDA)
+3. Far more than your own passport, which many nations allow you to renounce for the sake of taxes and political purposes. Your own birthplace!
+4. Far more than the title and ownershp of land or your own house - as Imminent Domain allows goverments to take it. We have a long trail of tears on that truth.
+5. Even slavery can be escaped by death!  That is NOT The case of the wedding vows!
+
+They are made by TWO ADULTS.  This can not be over-empasized.  you can't blame the 2015 divorces because kids get married at age 16.
+You can't blame.  This idea is SUPER ESSENTIAL. It must not be forgotten, it most not be discarded by the ego. It must not be defended
+against!  Remove your defenses, and FOCUS on this truth.  TWO EDUCATED SMART ADULTS, who have SEEN OTHER DIVORCES - ofen times their own parents!!!!!
+They have LIVED inside a marriage, failed or otherwise, their entire childhood!  To ignore this education, and their friends
+is to ignore how educaiton itself works!  Where do you learn language and fashion, if not from The World? Where do you learn Marriage?
+Do not give into the temptation to dismiss these Elephant in Room Truths!
+
+Do we think a goverment with it's military and spy agencies should be our higehst agreements of a society? That a peace treaty between
+two nations - that's it?  That the IRS not making mistakes is our highest ideal?  None of these have Eternity in their equation!!
+To dismiss eternity of the wedding vows, you may as well light the paper this is printed on and burn it. As you have already
+failed to see how POPULARITY of divorce has burned the very meaning of words!!
+
+Do people find it popular to leave difficult spouces. OF COURSE THEY DO.  I am not talking about ONE MARRIAGE HERE. I am talking
+about the TRUTH of TWO ADULTS, who make a PROMISE to overcome problems TOGETHER.
+
+A person can be a drunk without a marriage. A person can wreck a car and kill children WITHOUT a marriage! A person can be violent
+and rape and be a serial killer - WITHOUT A MARRIAGE!  Put down the book, pull up wikipedia and look at the history of serial killers
+and the largest ones in the world.  STOP DEAMONZING MARRIAGE!  Stop drinking the violance and money-oriented cool-aid.
+
+There is something UNIQUE in Wedding Vows, that exists NO WHERE ELSE!  Eternity.  Even the Military doesn't promise you Eternity
+except maybe a statue or a burial ground on an official state cemetary (trying to steal from REligion on that one).
+
+Wedding vows can NOT BE MADE by children. Wedding vows INSSIT on you having a valid concept of both PAIN and a valid concept of ETERNITY.  Guess what? We don't have a valid concept of either one!
+
+If your idea of pain is tiny and small, how can you make a wedding vows. To deafen your self to other peoples divorces, even your own parents, is to ignore the severity of the pain.
+
+Like soldiers who are returning from war and commiting suicide. No state institution can offer Compassion or Love. Even a church building can
+not house the homeless - only maybe feed them (many do not).  Organizations can not offer Love or Compassion! To think otherwise
+is to fall into advertising and marketing word switcherr.  Subaru and McDonald's both use the word LOVe - get your lazy self out of this
+book and go look at the TRUTH of this FACT!  And very few people are outranged by it. You think it's a small choice on their part,
+that the word "love" just accidently got slipped into their advertisement - like spilled onto the digital stream that produces the video?
+You think they repeat these advertisings over and over - and hire thin beautiful people just because those were the nearest ones
+they could find?  That every single aspect of that 60 seconds isn't carefully created?

+Socratic Logic and the problem
+
+Rick talks about this in Rajaa's first transcript. Politicans who do not believe anything.
+
+What he means is this:
+
+They have no FAITH, no FUTURE beliefe. If you listen to his full 8 hours repeated about 6 times, you learn his meaning.  Learning takes effort. Ads are repeated, but people do not repeat the non-ads.
+
+My father on September 21, 2015 gave me a counter-example of Germany and WW2.  But that's the very problem. You have already lost in
+the thinking because you are us vs. them. The dream of war is a Hitler and black/white wars.
+
+This is exaclty what Military wants!  This is what they are arming for, during peacetime, all the time. A Full value war.
+
+So, back to Rick - so politicians don't belive in FUTURE Utopia values, that's what rick hemans. They have no BELIEVE.
+They only believe in what is proven, not a future better than the past.
+
+PAST: Job promises, enemy in war rallies people, etc.
+
+FUTURE: World without war. Travel to Mars, no matter the cost - because better than fighting over land on Earth / oil /etc.

+Marriage Ego Personality
+
+Finding the perfect ego compatibility is still going to faill in the Troubadour view.  As the person will change over time, and the paths
+will diverge.
+
+Of course, a superficial Business Marriage is always possible.  This is educated by the socities, as Troubadour education is absent.
+
+years together is no real measure of happiness. Achievement of a Trouabadour message is measured in total depth, that of a religion
+where one is fully in harmon with the relationship, feels there are references (such as the religion text, bforut in our situatio we mean Troubadour teaching and so forth)
+
+---------
+
+Do people desire such a marriage today? In the post-appocolipic view I hold of post-modernity - as defined by Boudriourd
+NO. The majority of people do not want this.
+
+And campbell says the same, that the society.
+
+Although Campbell calls this a "monster state", and Boudriard does not. He says to adapt fatal strategies and accept that technology
+rules behavior, not self.  Rich explains this best in my view.
+
+People do not wish a real experience, most will not. Rich says transendence is possible for the ones who wish to escape
+the group behavior. But marriage is TWO people, and as campbelle explays Myths are unviersally misunderstood by language
+- so the boundry betwen "Marriage inside society" and "Troubadour marriage" is large and painful crossing. The threshould of each
+person must be large. A deep facination with re-reading and song lyrics, to a point of total obsesession - like a religion
+born again.  Or a divorce of such magintude that the person wishes to go beyond such large pain into the suspecicion
+of a even greater glory.
+
+-----------
+
+Extreme emotions are the result of the forsaken Troubadour marriage. The most complex wedding vows, the real commitment, like to that
+of a religion.
+
+so violance and deep depression must be managed. The partner must agree to not engage in outright warfare against each other's heart.
+
+Leo B is a good teacher on this, as is the study of complex muthology stories.  The film Interstellar, for example, to value truth
+between Brand and Coop as Brand realizes her 90% truth setting does not apply in a real experience.
+
+Egos must be understood and non-weaponized. The film Inception provides a good eductaion on a waaponized defended ego.
+Often to support business, society, war, etc.
+
+Vertigo and depression are to be mastered in ideally healthy ways. yoga with meditation, not just yoga physical.  Sex with
+Troubadour Love, not just oriental sex glory.

+Monomyth as a Sperical Encryption Key to the human brain
+
+I believe that metaphors can be related to fuse-blowing memories of pre-programmed myth.
+
+Myth being keys to cultural-specific icons, language, etc. And all the brain talents, such as dance, music, multi-lingual, autism/sevant,
+are exposures to non-restrained keys of generic or post-birth expressive development.
+
+the Monomyth is the key, if you could coidfy the sphere of the entire Bible, as James Joyce was doing and Campell
+expressed in Skelaton Key to Joyce's work.  As the review on Amazon stated, you start to read ALL BOOKS as The Wake.
+Just as I hve personally said that the role of the Quran is to read other material to Rajaa. That it is a tool of other tools.
+
+The TV series "The Code" uses a Church, an example of how artists were living and relating to the Monomyth - and were able
+to translate the "sound of the universe" as they heard it in their mind, to the construction of this particular featured church building.
+
+As Campbell and Jung say, all Myths have common themes that can be cross-referenced. A type of Rosetta Stone of a Monomyth can be created
+based on metaphors of each society cross-referenced. Devil, God, Prayer Day, Virgin Birth, etc.
+I believe The Eye of Reason, a non-binary value can be gated inside the mind - but most people these days, especialy computer
+cryptography thinkers and systems, are pure binary 0/1 inside their brain. But I imagine a trinagle logic holder of some sorts
+that could crack all known keys (like the theme of the film Sneakers). I have been able to create a virtualized pycological
+representation of this in my own mind for temporary periods and been able to peer into my own subconsious one
+and relate it to the symbols of my own culture (music from the Midwest I could deeply connect with) as Campbell describes
+that an artist can do with myth.  But my operating system training and understanding of software side of a hardware view
+(which is what consiousness, the perceived software perspective of a hardware brain) helped me recognize the significance
+of Campbell and Joyce creating a new myth - The Wake - and how Campbell has been able to apply much of the pattern
+from his own mind into the world-wide religions.
+
+Campbell himself had installed a type of meta-debugger that allowed him to peer into his own personal subconsious OS. he described his own
+as a light debugger, maybe a kind of user-app debugger as opposed to a harder kernel-mode debugger.  He used the term "slow burning rapture"
+in terms of his own personal mind.
+
+I think I tapped into the kernel-mode debugger, the Mystic one he describes, or "A Saint" one he describes in PoM.  But I had my yonng-age
+understanding of oprating systems that even Timothy Learly lacked, and surely Campbell lacked (hiw focus was on literate, metaphor of
+communications - not my personal metaphors of human interaction with binary machines).  The brain is NOT binary, that is clear to me
+but it surely had some experinece of cascading fuses like EEPROM being progrrammed.  I could see gates being burned
+and searching for Monomyth themes. For example, I would play a song and sense a pattern search of other similar songs
+that had the same Myth-chunking in a kind of b-tree or linear search.  Like trying to remember someone's name
+from a face.  But I also sense some circules had gone from left/right turns (A or B logic, binary) to a tri-state of
+infinate.  Like going from one data structure to another.  A self-awareness of Monomyth had developed a kind of brain defense
+system that you see depcited by the Nolan Brothers as a "hardened mind" in Inception.
+
+So i ould traverse into the song perspetive of the artist, seeing the perfect Monomyth pattern of the song (a 3 or 4 mintue song probably only using 2 or 3 of the Monomyth Metaphor chunks.
+Unlike say 20 hour True Detective + Interstellar 3 hours, which I felt almost hit on 70% of them or something - like 3000 Monomyth segments?)
+
+Pi describes a flat circle, but that's not enough. I feel the Monomyth brain key is a sphere. I don't know math enough, but is
+there some insane crazy number even a e=mc^2 magnitute beyond pi for a sphere? A Flatland kind of pi?  I expect
+it has soemthing to do with how a black hole feeds into big bang(s).
+
+Are there e=mc^2 dimensioanl fractals? That go more than just the expanding, but multi-dimensions like beyond Flatland?
+
+In Pi, the number never repeat. So that's like a super-duper Prime number. So existing ecnryption is built on Primes
+but that's not enough. The human brain, monomyyth sperical encryption, goes many dimensions further to where each is a kind of pi
+like number (think of Primes as Flatland, and MonoMyth sperical chunks as an order beyond Flatland - like Pi).
+
+perhaps Monomyth, our own brain, has i in it, imaginary numbers. They are metaphors of the mythologies. And all art, all myths, can reveal
+the chunks by cross-reference.  Like the church shown in "The Code" was built to hosue music notes.
+
+radar waves and return use imaginary numbers, so too does the black hole to big-bang traversal?
+
+Knowing the monomyth code would crack stock markets and weather patterns equal. And our hormone tables (offset by internal clocks).
+
+oh yes, star patterns of the southern and northern hemisphere are one of the monomoth keys. So we stand outside and we calibrate
+summer and winter ant some point in our mental development.  There are a series of perhaps 20 star patterns / light patterns
+in the Monomyth key. True Detective Season 2 had one.
+
+
+EDIT: Maybe triangle logic is wrong. The bees 2nd hour of "The Code" talks about Hex shape. Maybe intead of a binary gate
+there is an infinate holding logic gate (analog) of a hex shape.  So whatever flatland world digital computers live in
+a hex shape equivlant like a beehive honeycomb.
+
+Campbell said that he felt each symbolf of a Myth existed: "Myths primarily are for fundamental instruction in these matters. Our society today is not giving us adequate mythic instruction of this kind, and so young people are finding it difficult to get their act together. I have a theory that, if you can find out where a person is blocked, it should be possible to find a mythological counterpart for that particular threshold problem."
+
+Jackson Pollick created Fractal art work, and criticis ego vomited. James Joyce created Fractal literature, and critics ego vomited.
+Truth upsets people. Troubadours speak truth.

+Killing millions and billions of strangers
+
+Two education system:
+
+1. Terrorist using fear, images and family reports of muders - to psycologically create fear-concerned personlities.
+2. Advertising using desire.
+
+These are the principals of Mythology education, fear and desire.  Yet, both of these are not teaching Love and Compassion. In fact,
+both in-group define Love and Compassion.
+
+So people are conditioned in wealthy culture to their identity of music, fashion, foot preference, friend preference. And they will fight
+for these things. The perceived loss of these, they will fight for.  To have people so fragile, all it takes is a leader to create conditions
+and millions and billions can be slughtered.  This has happened before, on a less technological scale.
+
+Our education has failed to teach the psychology of war and to identify it with Edward Bernays advertising Propeganda. People will 
+fight for their right to party.  This is no joke. To trivilize people's identity and idea of investment, is to trivialize
+that people are willing to die for land that they can not take after heaven. And that even without children (marriage custody battles
+showing it really isn't about Love but power) - people fight for a lifestyle.
+
+Without psyche eduation or a serious attitude toward ending war (It's always far in the future, as if we humans don't decide to end it our own self).
+
+Fighting over books, images, mosques - that's exactly what Islam does. And people fighting over a lifestyle is a terribly messy war
+and Hitler was doing ti with germany.
+
+All someone has to do is have hitler's monomyth singing ability. To speak in the way that advertising does, that prophets do, as carl Jung
+said about Hitler.  Once we get a personality with that speaking talent, and a sexual lust for land and map games - like hitler
+people will die for their homeland society values. Even if that is sports teams and corporate logos.
+
+This is not a consipracy, this is a runaway nuclear reaction of psychological forces!  This is a real threat!  Education to counter this
+has always been weak and ineffective.  You can't just wave a wand over Ilamic Terrorist and turn them into lvoe-the-world equally hippies.
+Shia/Sunni conflict to Sufi.  No, they would rather die and murder children than actually do this mental change. And that's the problem

+"America's leading industry is still the manufacture, distribution, packaging and marketing of bullshit.
+high quality bullshit. world class designer bullshit, to be sure. hospital tested, clinically proven bullshit. but bullshit nonetheless.
+and it always amuses me that so many people seem to think that bullshit only comes from certain sources.
+you know, advertising, politicians, salesmen... not true. bullshit is everywhere. bullshit is rampant. 
+parents are full of shit. teachers are full of shit. clergymen are full of shit. law enforcement people are full of shit. the entire country is completely full of shit. in fact, this country was founded by a group of slave owners who told us that all men are created equal. that is what's known as being stunningly, stunningly full of shit.
+
+and I think, people show their ignorance when they say they want politicians just to be honest. what are these people talking about?! if honesty were suddenly introduced into politics, it would throw everything off! the whole system would collapse! and I think, deep down the American people know that. the American people like their bullshit out front, where they can get a good strong whiff of it. 
+that's why they re-elected Clinton. listen, Clinton might be full of shit, but he let you know it. Dole tried to hide it: 'I'm an honest man.' bullshit! bullshit! people don't believe that shit. Clinton said, 'hi, I'm full of shit and how do you like that?' and the people said, 'at least he's honest. at least he's honest about being full of shit.'
+
+it's like the business world. all businessmen are completely full of shit. just the worst kind of people you could ever want to run into: businessmen. and the proof of it is, they don't even trust each other! they don't trust each other. when a businessman is negotiating a deal, the first thing he does is to automatically assume that the other guy is a complete lying prick who's trying to fuck him on the deal. so he has to do everything he can to fuck the other guy a little bit harder and a little bit faster.
+and then when it comes to dealing with costumers, that's when they get a big smile. that's when they get a big smile. a businessman always has that big smile on his face as he carefully positions himself directly behind the customer and unzips his pants and services the account. 'we specialize in customer service.' you heard that? now you know what that means. whoever coined the phrase 'let the buyer beware' was probably bleeding from the asshole.
+
+then you have advertising. advertising is the businessman's cheaply dressed two-dollar blow job. advertising sells you things you don't need and can't afford, that are overpriced and don't work. and they do it by exploiting your fears and insecurities. and if you don't have any, they'll be glad to give you a few by showing you a nice picture of a woman with big tits. that's the essence of advertising: big tits. threateningly big tits. and speaking of big tits, what about show business? show business – completely dishonest, corrupt and full of shit. but in a nice way...then you have the media. not just the news media, let's include them all.
+
+the media are almost literally exploding with bullshit. because they're located right at the crossroads of all the other bullshit. the media are made up of equal parts of advertising, politics, business, public relations, and show business. these people are sitting right at bullshit junction. there's enough bullshit in the media for Texas to open a branch office, and you still have enough left over to start two law firms and a christian bookstore.
+because folks, I gotta tell you, when it comes to bullshit, truly major-league bullshit, you have to stand back in awe of the all-time heavyweight champion of false promises and exaggerated claims: religion. organized religion. it's no contest. religion easily, easily has the best bullshit story of all time. think about it.
+
+religion has convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky, who watches everything you do every minute of every day. and the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn't want you to do. and if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place of burning, and fire, and smoke, and torture, and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer, and burn, and scream, until the end of time. but he loves you. he loves you. 
+he loves you, and he needs money. he always needs money.
+he is all-powerful, all-present, all-knowing, and all-wise, he just can't handle money. religion takes in billions and billions of dollars. they pay no taxes. but somehow they always need money. you talk about a good bullshit story... if I may be permitted a small pun: holy shit!"

+"To begin a new novel, I look for the biggest problem in my life that I can't solve or tolerate. Something that drives me nuts, but I can't fix. Then I find a metaphor that allows me to explore the problem, exaggerating and expanding it beyond reason. I build it up to the worst scenario possible and then find a way to solve it. By the time the book is done, I've exhausted all of my emotions around the original problem. Whatever it was, it no longer bothers me. And typically, during the time of writing, the problem has resolved itself. It's like magic. Try it. It will keep you alive in this world of bullshit."

+In The Ecstasy of Communication, he writes: “The impossibility of reconciling theory with the real is a consequence of the impossibility of reconciling the subject with its own ends. All attempts at reconciliation are illusory and doomed to failure.”
+ Baudrillard expresses the reversal or arresting of progress in another passage: “Our all-too-beautiful strategies of history, knowledge, and power are erasing themselves. It is not because they have failed (they have, perhaps, succeeded too well) but because in their progression they reached a dead point where their energy was inverted and they devoured themselves, giving way to a pure and empty, or crazed and ecstatic form.”

+"Does the delight one experiences in a game come from a dream-like situation, where one moves free of reality, but which one can quit at any time? Not at all. Games, unlike dreams, are subject to rules, and one just doesn't leave a game. Games create obligations like those found in challenges. To leave a game is unsportsmanlike.
+
+
+"Without a psychological or metaphysical foundation, the rule has no grounding in belief. One neither believes nor disbelieves a rule - one observes it. The diffuse sphere of belief, the need for credibility that encompasses the real, is dissolved in the game. Hence their immorality: to proceed without believing in it, to sanction a direct fascination with conventional signs and groundless rules."
+
+
+"Debts too are annuled. In games there is nothing to redeem, no accounts to settle with the past. For this reason, games appear unaware of the dialectic of the possible and impossible, there being no accounts to settle with the future. There is nothing "possible", since everything is played, everything decided, without hope and without alternatives, according to a relentless, unmediated logic. That is why there is no laughter around the poker table, for its logic is cool (but not casual); and the game being without hope, is never obscene and never lends itself to laughter. Games are serious, more serious than life, as seen in the paradoxical fact that in a game lives can be at stake."
+
+
+"Games, therefore, are no more based on the pleasure principle than the reality principle. They suppose the enchantment of the rule, and the sphere that the rule describes. And the latter is not a sphere of illusion or diversion, but involves another logic, an artificial, initiatory logic wherein the natural determinants of life and death have been abolished. This constitutes the specificity of games and their stakes. It makes no sense to reduce them to an economic logic that would speak of conscious investment, or to a logic of desire that would speak of unconscious motives. Conscious or unconscious - this double determination may be valid for the sphere of meaning and law, but not for rules and games."
+
+"The best analogy would be with primitive cultures, which have been described as closed in on themselves, incapable of conceiving of the rest of the world. But in our society the rest of the world exists only for us. Their closure, far from being restrictive, derives from a different logic which, because we are trapped within the imaginary of the universal, can no longer conceive of except pejoratively, as limited."
+
+"a form of ceremonial where the signs, because they are so violently attracted to each other, no longer leave any room for meaning, and can only duplicate themselves. Here too one finds the vertigo of seduction, the vertigo that comes of being absorbed in a recurrent fate. All societies other than our own are familiar with this theater of ritual, which is also a theater of cruelty. Games rediscover something of this cruelty. Compared with games, everything real is sentimental. The truth, and the Law itself are sentimental relative to the pure forms of repetition."
+
+"Remember the Babylonian Lottery. Whether or not it exists, the veil of indetermination it throws over our life is absolute. Its arbitrary decrees rule the least details of our existence. We dare not speak of a hidden infrastructure, for the latter will eventually be called upon to appear as truth - while here it is a matter of fate, that is, of a game that has always already been worked out, yet remains forever indecipherable."
+
+"A fractal war of all cells, all singularities, revolting in the form of antibodies. A confrontation so impossible to pin down that the idea of war has to be rescued from time to time by spectacular set-pieces, such as the Gulf War or the war in Afghanistan. But the Fourth World War is elsewhere. It is what haunts every world order, all hegemonic domination — if Islam dominated the world, terrorism would rise against Islam, for it is the world, the globe itself, which resists globalization."
+
+"if Islam dominated the world, terrorism would rise against Islam, for it is the world, the globe itself, which resists globalization."

+"Humankind has no prejudices: it is as happy to use itself as a guinea-pig as anything else, animate or inanimate. It will as happily gamble with the destiny of its own species as with that of all the others. In its blind will for greater knowledge, humanity is programming its own destruction with the same offhandedness, the same ferocity, as it is programming that of other species. It cannot be accused of greater egoism. Humanity is sacrificing itself to an experimental destiny unknown to the other species, which have hitherto been left to meet their natural fates. And whereas something like a self-preservation instinct seemed to be associated with that natural fate, this recent experimental destiny sweeps any such notion aside. A sign that, behind the ecological obsession with protection and conservation, which has more to do with nostalgia and remorse, a quite different trend has already won out: the trend towards the sacrifice of the species and unlimited experimentation."

+Compassion Depression
+
+Campbell 1986:
+" It's you. All of these symbols in mythology refer to you. You can get stuck out there, and think it's all out there. So you're thinking about Jesus with all the sentiments relevant to how he suffered -- out there. But that suffering is what ought to be going on in you. Have you been spiritually reborn? Have you died to your animal nature and come to life as a human incarnation of compassion?"
+
+But that's against the 99.9% half+half:
+
+“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.” ― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor
+
+=============
+
+So depression is a natural outcome of this state. Because if you love all strangers, you see things going on int he world
+often in the name of false love or myth - to murder, kill, etc.
+
+The corrupted myth is where Love Compassion Forgiveness - the difficult pages are removed. And it hurts to care about a nameless
+stranger murdered.

+Hollywood and funding
+
+Deleted replies:
+
+Ok, so you want replies that only confirm what you already believe. What a surprise to tell me it wasn't your question.  That also ignores that other people had already replied, my comments weren't ignorant of what was **already covered by other replies**.
+
+>  I think you're drinking the rose-tinted kool-aid just a bit too hard there on societal issues
+
+There is no factory making it. It's the factory kool-aid that is advertising, news, marketing, films - commercial art.  I am specifically speaking outside factory kook-aid.
+
+> this general cynical view on how everyone else is lost in this wasteland except for the few enlightened
+
+Yha, that's the general view, haha!  No it isn't.  Name people who support NO TEAMS, not A vs. B.
+
+"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to **economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few.** I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence." - Martin Luther King, Jr.
+
+That speaks for the point I am making. Athletes, actors, the worship of the rich and beautiful. Rich actors who enslave people with their personality and charms - their ability to lie and fake on recorded images - who make billions of dollars.  Money and fame people trafficking is the very basis of Hollywood and factory consumption. If you don't view adverting as an education tool then you of course are going to say I and Jean are full of shit.  I'm not inexperienced with knee-jerk reactions, being called a heretic against Edward Bernays.
+
+You think my view is the general view? no, 99.9% of people can't even figure out the Quran and Bible and Upanishads and Totem Poles can be translated with each other - just like many films.  Instead, these art poetry are politics ploys where every person takes one side or another and nobody wants to actually understand what the story is saying.  Your reply shows no understanding of the topics I have presented and the people I have cited as references.
+
+================
+
+Second reply.
+
+> itself propagating the very culture you claim to detest.
+
+When did I claim to detest it?  And which culture exactly? Japan, China, USA, or ?.
+
+
+> itself propagating the very culture you claim to detest.
+
+People who detest things in 2015 don't even reply. They just unfriend and quit conversations. They just reach for down-vote. It isn't detest my friend, I love art - and I think art is the most powerful education system there is. But I think people would rather masturbate to an actress than have a real conversation of peer to peer nature.  500 men staring at a actress masturbating, a circle-jerk, is not peer to peer engagement beyond "team A - woman on screen, team B - audience".  The actress on the screen is a brand, with a massive team of makeup artists, agents, PR teams, marketing, etc.
+
+Funding of art also should not directly assume obscene wealth by the corporate film studios, music recording companies, nor the film actors.  To me, that topic has to be thrown into the mix!  At no point in human history has film making ever been so inexpensive - yet somehow people call every thing "cheesy" that doesn't have a massive budget!  To ignore that issue is to ignore the HyperReality factor.
+
+The very topic at hand, you pose changing the monetizing system of art and entertainment vs. art. **And you somehow think this is a simple and small topic.**  Well, I provided you loads of citations - and links to full discussions on the topic.  I also referenced Banksy indirectly, but I'll mention him specifically - as I think he has a ton to say on the topic (and he is also a walking Bagism as defined by John Lennon+Yoko Ono which calls back to The Little Prince story - all relevant to this topic).
+
+None of this is easy answers. As the topic at hand is massively complex in my view.  It isn't just a casual conversation to me.  I didn't write a small reply that avoided the elephant in the room.
+
+If you don't view terrorism is an education system, using images (video, film) of fear to control people - then you are going to just bail right out on the thinking I am presenting. If you don't view advertising and marketing (Edward Bernays) as using images (video and film) to educate in a factory fashion - you are just going to bail right out on the thinking I am presenting.
+
+Guess how many people want to actually work and learn about how complicated all these things really are?  The common cynical view is reactionary. If you can't start naming people who have brought up this point before (I can go all the way back to Dante) - we have to re-invent the entire vocabulary of even describing the problem and what has been attempted before.
+
+You want to find for me how many people are speaking the equations of how terrorism and art relate to each other?  That religion and art are the same thing? That religion and psychology have a relationship?
+
+I sure don't find many people!  I don't hear it on the news, I don't find it said in millions of reddit comments, I don't find it but in extremely small numbers.
+
+> how do we **make people** pay for things when there are so many ways to **make people** not pay for things but movies need people to pay for things to get money.
+
+Make means force, and I think there is no substitute for proper education and understanding.  Advertising and obscene profits do not make for equality.  The very idea of "make people" seems entirely what advertising is all about, the Edward Bernays logic of changing the system by being a hidden manipulator.  It is not a Free society, nor is it an Open society.
+
+Well, does experience for this exist? I think it does, and I have a lot of personal experience in experiments with it.  September 1983  Richard Stallman at MIT put forth a whole series of ideas on how to fund things in new ways.  He could see where things were heading, the raise of super-wealth like Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs, etc.
+
+> how everyone else **is lost** in this wasteland except for the few enlightened is a view that is in and out of itself propagating
+
+Lost? no, I think they want it. When democratic nations vote for war, leaders who support war, and vote for actors who are obscenely wealthy (ticket sales) - and don't question - hey isn't $5/million a year enough for one person? Maybe release the film to the public domain after it is done paying for itself?
+
+If your faith is being Rich and Famous - if that's your religion - then I guess how we finance films is probably going to be a very limited discussion.
+
+if you think advertising has no role in this, and only "dumb people" listen and are influenced by advertising... then this is going to be a very limited discussion.  To me, advertising almost seems like pollution dumped into the ocean - it is impacting ALL of us - and what we see at the cinema, what we see on reddit headlines / TV news, the wars we fight. The polluted ocean is impacting me and everyone else. There are no people outside of this! Denial of it is just the easier answer than actually looking at the history and multiple perspectives on such things.
+
+These topics are so massively complicated that there is no WAY I can sound sane, because I don't believe we even have all the words and understanding of what is going on.  That's why I brought in Jean Baudrillard and Joseph Campbell.  These people sure as hell write and explain things better than I do.

+
+Joseph Campbell pointed this out directly about the rule system fragility, law fragility, of Religions:
+
+"All religions have been true for their time. If you can recognize the enduring aspect of their truth and separate it from the temporal applications, you've got it."
+
+"There was a terrific fermentation at that time—heresy all over the place. Heresy is the life of a mythology, really, and orthodoxy is the death."
+
+"that's not simply a characteristic of modern Americans, that is the biblical condemnation of nature which they inherited from their own religion and brought with them, mainly from England. God is separate from nature, and nature is condemned of God. It's right there in Genesis: we are to be the masters of the world."
+
+"And if you study the history of Christianity in Europe, it's outstanding characteristic is heresy: battles against heresy, fight against heresy, this way and that—and finally heresy won. With Protestantism, the individual conscience was to be the judge, not a social authority that tells you what you are to believe.
+
+Now it is my view that in this present world of this present minute, we are facing the hour of decision: man against the authority of a group that claims divine authority—and we have plenty of those groups, and they are all getting together cozy here and there. And it just seems to me this decision has to be recognized and confronted."
+
+"To say, as the Indians say, “I, in my own essence am that mystery”—Tat vam asi, thou art that, you are it—to say that on this side of the line is the final end, basic heresy. These are two totally contrary world religions."
+
+"Eternity isn't some later time. Eternity isn't even a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now that all thinking in temporal terms cuts off. And if you don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere."
+

+
+I remember when computers helped. When people used computers to file taxes. But now it's the reverse, the system ahs grown so complex
+that the human, as an idnividual, no longer fits within a computer
+
+Artists
+
+Bobby Fisher, individual artists who would have befriended 
+
+Suicide by confronting the realization that people would rather be slaves to their beauty and social charms. They have seen the mass behavior, experienced it,
+and do not like it.  It is a poor education system, a poor mass behavior, not a democracy in anyway way.  The USA Eye of Reason is all manners of life,
+not just laws and governing.
+
+Our marriages and custody battles are the most striking evidence.  Roger Ebert's Chicago review of A Seperation from Iran
+directly referenced this failure of logic.  
+
+We have removed art and replaced it with entertainment, ticket selling, where her Campell and Stephan A. H both detail
+that art is the most improtant teaching tools. And advertising divides the minds of people, logos and brands, and
+true art unites and 
+
+Murdered individiauls are of this order: John Lennon, MLK Jr, Ghandi, Malala
+
+These are all outside the binray Pascal programming of the law. And to ignore this is to ignore the revlution in thinking that

+=========
+
+"Natural Language Programming (NLP) is an ontology-assisted way of programming in terms of natural language sentences, e.g. English. A structured document with Content, sections and subsections for explanations of sentences forms a NLP document, which is actually a computer program. Natural languages and natural language user interfaces include Inform7, a natural programming language for making interactive fiction; Shakespeare, a joke natural programming language in the style of the plays of William Shakespeare, and Wolfram Alpha, a computational knowledge engine, using natural language input."
+
+Practically no person has stood up to this issue. That the Psychology industry is entire corrupt on the Freud and drug side of things.
+That repressing the subconsious with drugs is a horrible idea. Education, sharing understanding, of all people is the proper solution

+Campbell says Myth's key teaching is to burst this bubble. Shadow play quote.

+And people only learn it to burst other people's bubble. To market, advertise, enslave, control, manipulate.  Truth itself is the deeper

+The snake is also a pure stomach - and skin shedding. For all these reasons, it serves as a POSITIVE tool - not the poison that we

+

+Autism as a future human mind and abuse by Psyche bullshit in USA
+
+"I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. 
+I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects.
+ But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors." - Jefferson to H. Tompkinson (AKA Samuel Kercheval), July 12, 1816
+
+Has the IRS made psyche changes since MLK Jr? Or only technical changes. Not facing the segregation of corporations and individuals. Small busines vs. Large Corps with lawyers and accountants.
+
+Thomas Jefferson Also said this
+God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. ...And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure."
+November 13, 1787, letter to William S. Smith. I do believe the context is the French Revolution.
+bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse."
+
+"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks." - Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, August 19, 1785
+
+Encourage all your virtuous dispositions, and exercise them whenever an opportunity arises, being assured that they will gain strength by exercise as a limb of the body does, and that exercise will make them habitual ... Give about two [hours] every day to exercise; for health must not be sacrificed to learning. A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives a moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprize, and independance to the mind. Games played with the ball and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be the constant companion of your walks. Never think of taking a book with you. The object of walking is to relax the mind. You should therefore not permit yourself even to think while you walk. But divert your attention by the objects surrounding you. Walking is the best possible exercise. Habituate yourself to walk very far. The Europeans value themselves on having subdued the horse to the uses of man. But I doubt whether we have not lost more than we have gained by the use of this animal. No one has occasioned so much the degeneracy of the human body. An Indian goes on foot nearly as far in a day, for a long journey, as an enfeebled white does on his horse, and he will tire the best horses. There is no habit you will value so much as that of walking far without fatigue. I would advise you to take your exercise in the afternoon. Not because it is the best time for exercise for certainly it is not: but because it is the best time to spare from your studies; and habit will soon reconcile it to health, and render it nearly as useful as if you gave to that the more precious hours of the day. A little walk of half an hour in the morning when you first rise is adviseable also. It shakes off sleep, and produces other good effects in the animal economy.

+He failed to see what Boudriard sees. That the gun is mighter, the technology of gun, changed people more than the learning.

+This is what Campbell shows!  That there is a focus on:

+2. Proper ways to read it
+3. A true understanding of Unity, non-division of any kind (the whole universe, not just one skin color, protestant vs. catholic, shia vs. sunni)

+So then the problem becomes one of:
+
+1. Ignorance: A well established religion concept. Mohammad's non-beleiver path. Or in Hindu: Avidyā

+Does this mean believing in the rules? no. It means beleving in the TRUTH.  Vs. living in fear of death all the time.

They’ve long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.

+
+They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.

+Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!

And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it.

Nobody seems to care! Good honest hard-working people; white collar, blue collar it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on.

-Autism's Truth
-
-IT's important to realize the experience of autism is not scientific.
-
-What it FEELS LIKE to Live in an Autistic Mind is not what it feels like to read a DNA report printout or to study DNA under an electron microscope.
-
-The outside view is a shallow view. Because inside ever human subconsious, dreams and Myths, we have this essential understanidng. Our failure is to not associate
-WHY religious leaders teach forgiveness, compassion as the proper answer to conflict. Instead, we keep trying to force autistic
-behavior to fit our factory conformity.
-
-The book, Essential Difference Male and Female mind...
-
-Fits right with Joseph Campbell's principal conflusion, as he said at age 82 in 1986:
-
-"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
-
-yet, science tries to run around, and bookshelves full of autism - that refuse to recognize the exepreince of  lviing in a mind, the expereince of sharing poetry
-on how it feels to live life - with the 
-
-By having a society so robotically ridgid and arbitrary - as each on earth currently is in many ways, an Autistic can not be free nor understood.
-Interepreted through a logical binary thinking, ignoring dreams and Myths triangle perspective, it's conflict after conflict.
-
-The outsider observer does not consider hormone cycles and wishes to force drugs and medicines to cram the hormones into society conformity.
-Instead of learning, and accomodating - there is a massive tendancy - an almost absolute reactionary trend - to smash the mind of the autistic
-into submission.  Much like Homosexuality was treated with a person like Alan Turing - by the systemic logic of his society peers.
-
-Robotic behavior seems easier. As does war and killing. A single bomb can kill millions in minutes. It is easy! The weapon was far easier to build and deploy
-than Eden on Earth ever has been!  yet, we marvel at our power - and our high educations - and have failed to listen to the voices of Dante, Campbell, etc.
-
-It could never possibly be repeated too many times:
-
-"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
-
-Psycology would interpret the opening of the heart, compassion, the Myth commonality inside the mind, as:
-
-- "co-dependence"
-- "Transferance"
-- "Identity crisis"
-
-Doctors strive to maintain secrecy between patients, confidentiality. They very opposite of religion, which are the most printed books
-in society! Doctors act like military, an eliate few who tell others what it means, the very opposite of "oepn source" in computing
-and the very opposite of Democracy as defined by the American ideal of Reason.  Military secrecy is power, and military is power.
-These can not be over-emphasized in the popularity and success of these shallow viewpoints.
-
-Artists are elnslaved by fame and greed. They are not seen as tools of 100% of everyone else, as music to dance by peer to peer
-they are seen by the Fear Authority, a military ruler thinking, to be enslaved by Fame and Greed. They want to be counted on selling
-the immeasure, the 20 year later dance and heart opening, can not be counted on the top selling albums list of 1978!
-
-The focus on short-term gain is the military appraoch. A gun changes a brain in seconds, fear and terror work very quickly in their
-educaiton. A Dog can witness another animal with it's eyes being beaten - and get the message very easily.  Whereas, the message
-of the complex view of poetry in Adam and Eve - isn't so quick, and factory teaching and it's conformity
-
-Ao the Autistic's peers are constantly trying to apply short hatcheting of the behavior. To carry a gun to fight back. Chemical drugs,
-and longer-term things such as "cognative behavior therapy".  Reprogramming the mind, instead of learning from it.  This one book
-spells out exactly what campbell was saying:
-
-"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
-
-And further, an Autistic fits Campbell's descrption of how a Shaman is developed;
-
-
---
-
-"Since the inspiration comes from the unconscious, and since the unconscious minds of the people of any single small society have much in common, what the shaman or seer brings forth is something that is waiting to be brought forth in everyone. So when one hears the seer's story, one responds, "Aha! This is my story. This is something that I had always wanted to say but wasn't able to say." There has to be a dialogue, an interaction between the seer and the community. The seer who sees things that people in the community don't want to hear is just ineffective. Sometimes they will wipe him out."
-
-And, of course, autistics are surpressed - trying to be cornered, confined, restricted - wipped out.
-
-Ideally everyone would open up to their subconsious. Autism not viwed as an epedimic, but a healthy more balanced viewpoint in which
-the real problems are removed; violence, fear, terror.  Just like religious terrorist, military terrorists, threatening the world with
-ICBM's and swords alike - violence is the real common problem - but are we listening to Leo talk about his experience with child development
-and how the child wanted to smash Mommy and Daddy? This one child was articulate, not all have the worlds and the listening Leo!
-
-Alas, do we need to have each individual speak it, when it was told to us right in our religions?  It was there, all along, in our educations
-but we have let the military violence-controlling perspective de-emphasizes compassion, forgiveness, and adam/eve ('one parent for all humanity') perspective?
-Again, our listening peer to peer and to the message of "look higher" (to heaven) and not to the Castle high or the Fear high. But even a higeher
-education than fear and terror - and advertising's immediate profit-return.
-
-Eternity means, look so long you see everything.
-Heaven means, higher educated viewpoint - so high that you see everything.
-
-Don't be shallow and short-sighted. Forgiveness, Compassion - these come from education. Religion born of books and speakers, oral tradition.
-Not something a pig, dog, or cat can scratch together in George Orwell's Animal Farm fashion.
-
-To declare religion "dumb' it to say "music and poetry" are dumb.  It is a psychological deflection, a dismisall, of the ego. What's dumb
-is our approach to Autism, and our use of advertising psychology and how we believe it's the highest form and most important method of
-education.  No, it's a few people segreating the others. Like military leaders who have all along turned men into mechanized warriors - who
-wish every one to rush into battle to service death and destruction.  We admire and label these people as heroes. We are saying that
-their system of thinking, like an Animal Farm, is the best.  And we have let them turn religion hippies into Action Heroes by 
-telling us to not read poetry and poetry.  But as historical fact and conquest education books.
-
-Campbell:
-
-"Every religion is true one way or another. It is true when understood metaphorically. But when it gets stuck to its own metaphors, interpreting them as facts, then you are in trouble."
-
-And I think the same can be said of Autism. If a brain operates with a different clock, don't smash that brain's clock. Learn, find out what
-disharmony there is - sounds, stimulation, etc.  And you may suddenly realize that your very education system is not in harmonly with truth.
-That advertising and factory classrooms are conformity machines, military training grounds, and so has become youre very methods of
-funding artists.

-God is not an artist to fund, he doesn't need us. We could learn from that understanding. Like William Shakespeare, it isn't about
-being remembered - or even the recorded film of the actor's performance. IT's the story, our own self, and not to fetish the actor or the author
-but to see it peer to peer - in every Romeo and Juliet we encounter.
-
-repeating:
-"Whenever one moves out of the transcendent, one comes into a field of opposites. One has eaten of the tree of knowledge, not only of good and evil, but of male and female, of right and wrong, of this and that, and of light and dark. Everything in the field of time is dual: past and future, dead and alive, being and nonbeing. But the ultimate pair in the imagination are male and female, the male being aggressive, and the female being receptive, the male being the warrior, the female the dreamer."
-
-
-My mind is repeating it, my own self, so I'm repeating it to you.  I am, not being a robot, I'm being a human! And not afraid to repeat due to superficial views.
-Until the wars stop, until we get a far greater harmony of individuals peer to peer, it needs repeating!
-
-"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
-
-As Campbell says:
-
-"That's what a meditation is. Meditation means constantly thinking on a certain theme. It can be on any level. I don't make a big split in my thinking between the physical and the spiritual. For example, meditation on money is a perfectly good meditation. And bringing up a family is a very important meditation. But there is an alone meditation, when you go into the cathedral, for example. [] Prayer is relating to and meditating on a mystery."
-
-the mystery, as I'm encouraing you to see, is MLK's viewpoint, how far can we go in compassion?
-
-"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination.

I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
-
-I see no mystery in war and military logic. I see predictable non-mystery and "sensible" outcomes that people have settled their eyes on. Heaven and Eternity removed from from poetry, and the sight of each other as individuals.
-
-As an Autistic, this statement fits exactly the experience iwth family and friends, who refuse to educate for non-profit means, such as Autism. In a profit oriented factory educaiton system, you do not learn what is unprofitable. Autistics are so difficult, it's just easier to eliminate theem from your life. And the life of an Autistic is isolated, by very definition. The marriage (lack of) and divorce rates
-show that people don't care about soul and spirit of a person, they care about their predictable behavior. Which Autism slants toward the unpredictable.  yet, the same spirit and soul exists, but is not the topic of factory edcuation.
-Factory education enslaves, and does not open to peer to peer distinctions and grwoth into the Garden.  So an Autistic's life with family and friends is a "nightmare of errors", not a comedy.
-
-"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection." - MLK Jr.
-
-It's like the very popular idea that marriages should not form in a workplace environment. Especialy in America with it's high working hours. The hours you are awake, you aren't supposed to practice Love.
-This idea is incredibly shallow and militant. It is to weaponize life for the sake of factory behavior and dehumanization.  And punishment and corruption are claimed when 
-love forms between two people. IT's perfectly fine for the military gang, the corporation, to lvoe and aquire another company, but not for two inner individuals to express Life outside the square cublicles.
-We consider this our highest ideal.  And the few times our politicans are hontest, their extramarial affairs, we punish the for spreading Love outside their marriage.
-We are so anti-Love and anit-Compassion in our systems of reward and punishment it's absurd beyond all comprehension.
-
-"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection." - MLK Jr.
-
-Again, two corporations can dance and mate, partner and cross-license. This is our education? This is what we teach at Harvard Business School?
-And our Church, MOsque, Temple and even Artist are all enslaved by the same thinking.  SOMEHOW becoming slaves of their own production methods, factory reproduction.
-
-
-As FN said, pointed out by Campbell in his final great work (Inner Reaches of Outer Space):
-
-"
-
-And from this perspective, viewing art, the same Nietzsche declared: "Art is the proper task of life, art is life's meta­
-physical exercise . . . . Art is more worth than truth. "
-
-
-Again, two corporations can dance and mate, partner and cross-license. This is our education? This is what we teach at Harvard Business School?
-And our Church, MOsque, Temple and even Artist are all enslaved by the same thinking.  SOMEHOW becoming slaves of their own production methods, factory reproduction.
-
-So, a family wishing "stability" discards listening deeply to Autism's truth, trying to impose the conforming of the particular society time period (which changes decade to decade) in short-sighted fashion.  The autistc is "treated" and "structured" into conformity.
-
-Style and preference is the enemy. Inflexibility. Being in love with one's own mask. Identity politics. Identity with subsets, with segregation.
-
-"Fourteen years ago, a leading drug maker published a study showing that the antidepressant Paxil was safe and effective for teenagers. On Wednesday, a major medical journal posted a new analysis of the same data concluding that the opposite is true." (New York Times, 17 September 2015).
-
-Well, what it it takes 250 years? What if Buddha and Jesus were saying this all along - that greedy short-sighted fixes do not ever equal
-the creation of Compassion and Forgiveness.  That Eternity and All of the Universe (heavens) were not ideas to be reduced or dismissed. Infinity and beyond!
-
-Instead of increasing Love for those who need it, we try to apply mechanical approaches. Robots, logical binary thinking. Not a Triangle Trinity like Reason.
-
-And 'safe and effective' - no violence, right? Prisons do the same thing.  when Suicide is treated fine, and military soldiers treated as wrong - then we might be actually getting the point.
-But so far, it seems Military Soldiers and Police with Guns are cool. Instead of Police with hugs and free tickets to the cinema. "Arresting" through force
-shouldn't be reduced, it should be the ideal of Eternity and Heaven to strive to always eliminate it!
-
-Autism is sensory changes, a brain shift in perception, which can also be achieved through education:
-
-"You unlock it by getting somebody to help you unlock it. Do you have a dear friend or good teacher? It may come from an actual human being, or from an experience like an automobile accident, or from an illuminating book. In my own life, mostly it comes from books, though I have had a long series of magnificent teachers."
-
-Being birthed with a mind open to alternate perceptions is such a shock to the family, there is tons and tons of books and blogs on the subject, entire films, etc. "How do I cope with this devil child!".
-
-Yet, as Campbell points out, perhaps it is the entire Society who is in the wrong view on the matter. Autism is a bestower of bliss, telling us
-that our education system of cramming ideas into minds, advertising and structured classrooms, is killing us all. And we don't believe it.
-
-
-"In Buddhist systems, more especially those of Tibet, the meditation Buddhas appear in two aspects, one peaceful and the other wrathful. If you are clinging fiercely to your ego and its little temporal world of sorrows and joys, hanging on for dear life, it will be the wrathful aspect of the deity that appears. It will seem terrifying. But the moment your ego yields and gives up, that same meditation Buddha is experienced as a bestower of bliss." 
-
-and further:
-
-"This is what is known in Sanskrit as viveka, "discrimination." There is a very important Buddha figure who is shown holding a flaming sword high over his head -- and so what is that sword for? It is the sword of discrimination, separating the merely temporal from the eternal. It is the sword distinguishing that which is enduring from that which is merely passing. The tick-tick-tick of time shuts out eternity. We live in this field of time. But what is reflected in this field is an eternal principle made manifest."
-
-We aren't living in a culture of geographic or information segregation. It's only one click away, but are we Listening?
-
-If a child was born without 2 legs, a family would accomodaet. But born with a different mind! Nope, hammer it with drugs and education conformity.
- 
-Be believe black/white skin color was our ownly massive mistake?  MLK, Jr; Keep Moving From This Mountain (1965):
-
----------
-
-Modern psychology has a word that is probably used more than any other word in psychology. It is the word "maladjusted." Certainly we all want to live the well adjusted life in order to avoid neurotic and schizophrenic personalities. But I must honestly say to you tonight my friends that there are some things in our world, there are some things in our nation to which I’m proud to be maladjusted, to which I call upon all men of goodwill to be maladjusted until the good society is realized. 
-
----------
-
-Modern technology has showed us what we really want. Complete enslavement of the artist. We want sequels to films, our ego craves the home theater with other pesky non-friend humans removed.
-We want to be able to pause the artist, to rewind, to enslave the presentation to confirm to our pre-conceived animal lust for consumption.
-
-The ability to take a film, pause it, show it when you wish, and eliminate the journey to the dedicated cave of the cinema - remove the temple, mosque, and 
-is being sold and packaged. It isn't an education system of freedom, it's the pinicle alta vista of advertising and marketing! It's the golf-course
-retirement community of pure segregation from the youthful interaction of the school playground!
-
-We have been conditioned by marketing and advertising, in an ego feedback loop to expect:
-
-1. Blockbusters. To choose the POPULAR film. Because conformity and acceptance is sold through participation.
-2. Trailers and pre-conception, to pave pathways into our mind of expectations, of desire.
-3. To extend this into our homes, to seperate the difficult human beings who sit next to us in seats, in favor of factory-produced machines
-   and on-demand digital personal delivery.
-4. To not prepare in ritual, bathroom and such, but to pause and let our artist be interrupted
-5. Hold copyrights and trademarks to ensure that the future generations can profit from the blockbuster reputation.
-
-
-It's like asking a band to stop playing in the middle of a dance so just one person can go to the toilet!
-
-Does it support some special case, sure, and that is good. A handicapped person, etc. But shouldn't the theater technology be advancing to do the same, just as public roads and sidewalks should advance?
-
-But marketing and advertising is always pushing ego learning. Ego development. Self, me, look at me for what I own and wear and cosmetically apply.
-
-We have turned art, an ego subversion, into an ego grout. A weld that is even stronger than the material being welded. Artist who seek profit and fame
-are going to win. The bullet of the military approach of teaching, the ego logic of kill or be killed, applies equally to the artist.
-I'm famous, therefore my message has been understood.  Of course, real learning doesn't work this way!  We have had countless military
-leaders who are both famous and admired - but the fact they are teaching murder seems to have been principaly ignored and even outright
-overlooked.  Our corporate leaders are often no different. Seeking leadership through ability to enslave the masses, not in peer to peer
-education. They seek money, power, fame, control, wealth. Not for All, but for their teams. Military is really the ideal way to see this
-approach. And the same teaching paths have been given to our religious material.  The teachers are failing to see the outcome of their students
-and their own teaching technique.  Advertising, marketing, and square classrooms ARE the devil. If no compassion develops, no forgiveness
-develops, no risk-taking in service of Love - then education is just not working.

+Bad Areas, Bad Learning
+
+One thing that I think a lot of people hold as a "dear personal true rule":
+
+1. Stupid things happen in stupid geographic places
+2. "Stay out of the bad area"
+3. Ignorant groups and bad things can not give raise to good things
+
+But this ignores the very creation of anything! Humans evolved out of animals, violence.
+
+There's a lack of FAITH in sharing GOOD education, openess, and self-learning.
+
+Bill Gates, Mark Z - people don't talk about the merits of being independent self learners
+WHy is this attitude so prevelant?
+
+1. 1960's demand for trainng was high - and a degree was evidence of knowledge - and path to wealth and respect.  But that
+was before the laser-printing, youtube, self-learning revoluion of computing / information systems age. Yet, the faith in it
+persists like a broken out of date religion.  Greet and prestige, famous family names, drives this falsehood.
+
+2. Marketing, investing.  Those who got a degree say in 1995 - want those in 2015 to value it.  That way it gives them power
+and extra income - by constantly promoting the value of the identity and brand of their certificaiton paper.  "The Establishment"
+does in fact have rewards and incentive to keep a brand alive, even if the idea and world has changed.  Pyramid sceme thinking,

+> And what does the Pentagon have to gain by doing this?
+
+It's an interesting question. In a way, the people at the Pentagon and a Islamic terrorist share certain mental pathways / attitudes that they educate and cultivate.
+
+1. They believe in violence and defense as a honorable lifestyle
+2. They have a very binary view of good death that says: suicide / turning away from war is bad - but other-sacrificing (killing) is good.
+3. Brands and logos are very important. The Islam Terrorist wraps himself in Quran violence-interpretation propaganda. Just as Pentagon people wrap themselves in tradition of war - plus flag or other identity.  They de-emphasize individual human beings (and even villages) in favor of "team identity" ("USA! USA! Allah Ackbar, Allah Ackbar").
+4. Pentagon is big on rules, regulations, order. So is the Islamic terrorist.  Hippies and artists (and Sufi Islam) are very often at the opposite end of this - and you often find militant people mocking and hating the complicated diverse world of hippies and non-binary views. Both terrorist and military can have problems with gender mixes, homosexuality, racial integration, etc.  They strive to shore these problems up by changing rules and regulations - but they **do not teach Love and tolerance** like an artists or hippie.
+
+ملاله یوسفزۍ ;October 8, 2013; [Video YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjGL6YY6oMs): "I started thinking about that, and I used to think that the Talib would come, and he would just kill me. But then I said, 'If he comes, what would you do Malala?' then I would reply to myself, 'Malala, just take a shoe and hit him.' But then I said, 'If you hit a Talib with your shoe, then there would be no difference between you and the Talib. You must not treat others with cruelty and that much harshly, you must fight others but through peace and through dialogue and through education.' Then I said I will tell him how important education is and that 'I even want education for your children as well.' And I will tell him, 'That's what I want to tell you, now do what you want.'"
+
+Education is slower and boring to people who fetish counting up their military technology and weaponry.  Militant people on both sides favor action, quickness, measurable progress (movement of map lines, key holy lands on maps, "homeland", etc).

-2. Soldiers march in uniform, think muscle memory - like the brain scans of Grand Masters
-3. Advertising consumers respond to the taste memory of a "confort food" and to the healty people images of the advertising.

-Shia and Suni, 99% of islam - factory. But Mohammad was no FACTORY learner, he was incredibly creative, on a scale far beyond average
- he was not a follower, he was a author, a teacher, a philosopher! A Prophet is a super-philosoper - as their ideas are not only
- creative and new - but also accepted by the society (so many speak to god, but are rejected; being only philosophers of telling their

-If you are a musician mastering your instrument, sure! Walking without fumble, sure! But to memorize sex with a partner, to memorize talking without thinking (being a recording device), to memorize
- to memorize being a mercenary killer soldier, reaction and anticipation patterns, for any war you wish?
- These are the very paths of evil that Religion was speaking of. Mindless slave behavior to some small group of men, not to the higher God

+
+------------
+
+Yet, it gets the typical heretic treatment to question the faith that funding so much through advertising is psychologically unhealthy and dumbs up the entire society. You get a very narrow range of beautiful voices, commercial art, and language style that people become conditioned toward. "Shh, be quiet, I need to hear what the top-achievers have to say".
+
+------------
+
+So, you take an issue - such as public transportation.
+
+1. Spend $1 Billion on a bus system
+2. Spend $1 Billion on a train system
+
+But you don't get much further.  You don't hear much in the way of:
+
+1. What works in the best cities so far- and how much cost overrun - and how much downtime, etc?
+
+Instead of understanding a problem space - people are encouraged to jump shallow to shallow, A vs. B, topic to topic.  You don't have time
+to worry about public transportation (which is about everyone, the entire society) as you have to fit in your personal preference
+of which TV show to watch.
+
+This is exactly what psychologically-focused leaders want.  It worked for the Roman Catholic Church / Roman Empire - enslaving continents
+on the Americas - and ignoring the "outside A or B" (Protestant or Catholic) division they had - and ruined peaceful trade and equality.
+
+The Established who wish to make things simple don't care for equality.  They care about being in the top 5% - and they know that
+those in the top 20% aspire to climb higher - to the top 5%.  The Faith system is in "progress" in this short-term and small-rewarding way.
+
+--------------
+
+Domestic violence examples, school shootings, local church bombings, homosexual attacks, etc
+
+If it's France and Germany - millions of people agaisnt millions - it's considered good thing to heal after a period of hateful violence (ww2).
+But if it's an individual, spouse vs. spouse, it's mocked as stupid and "people never change".
+When, in fact, there are plenty of people who change - and plenty of people willing to risk life for a flag - why not for a individual
+person (staying in a high risk marriage).  Food kills people, you risk life being married if the person is poor at safe food handeling.
+You risk life if that person eats something bad, kisses you or has sex with you, and infects you.
+Driving a car, you risk that.  They could burn the house down by ignorning a bad cord they use to plug something in.
+
+If the goal isn't to improve and be superior in unity, in two, then what EXACTLY Is the goal?  Just longer life - like putting
+everyone in a prison - elimination of violence - but also elimination of mistakes and errors?  Like the kind of couples
+who have seperate bedrooms and never have sex?
+
+There are so many types of marriage now - like this - that marraige for Love (Trbadour AMOR Love) is no longer a valid
+language assumption.  People don't seem to understand the wedding vows (bigger than job, money, flag - as it goes into Eternity)
+so we have to declare a new worud like the Troubadours did with AMOR.  Maybe "WeddingLock" instead of "marriage".

+==========
+
+Capitalism isn't just a competition between corporations / companies.  It becomes husband vs. wife, spouse seeking, etc
+Money becomes a personal status symbol, it becomes a divisive and corrosive Bling social behavior.
+
+Workpalce structure is just a result of the unspoken faith of "wht works".  Teams don't directly discuss
+how they work together - they just act it out.  Same with schools and classrooms.  A small number of 
+people control all the rest - it isn't a democratic choice.  And what works in Japan or China is radically different
+from USA - and what works in 1955 is radically different from 1995.  But people discuss none of this seriously
+and do to question the aurhtority top-down structure is to be a troublemaker
+
+A workplace in USA develops it's own dress code, hours structur, etc.  And if this does not fit with the person
+at that point in their life (hormones, emotions) they are to conform to the rigid structure or be labeled
+outcast or troublemaker ("other" dehumanization).
+
+------------
+
+> What happens when you feel like this every second of every day?
+
+If you are an American - ignore the ICBM's that a few hundred people on Earth threaten extinction of the rest with. We Won the cold war, and no way should you feel that small numbers of people fetish power, wealth and personal bloodlines so much that they would harm the rest of us. That was solved when the Berlin Wall came down. The DSM-5 has it properly accounted for. So now, your constant emotion that something is wrong should be properly dismissed and you should get to a medical doctor to have chemical agents correct for the consciousness mistake. If the drugs alone don't work, it's also best to avoid global travel, peer to peer conversation, and any news or books that try to suggest you should organize a peace protest and dismantle the military.

+Your ideas are so good, but people won't listen to you!
+
+This goes back to my job at SAP where I had this conversation so directly.  "Nice steak served on a garbage can lid" - and I countered
+with "dog shit served on fine gilded china".
+
+As dante says about truth.
+
+LISTEN to wht people are saying to me, all the time:
+
+1. Your ideas are good.
+2. Your ideas are fresh and could improve the world
+3. The idea is NOT adopted by the society, even if others had said it
+4. The presentation style controls adoption.
+
+Of course, the popular and "educated" answer - from our conformity schools of education - is that the speaker must alwys improve their speaking.
+
+Many artists have spoken up against this. And peace lovers within democracy! And spouses who talk about problems after divorce.
+
+But somehow our educators continue to IGNORE this one-sided answer.
+
+I have been witnessing this proble my ENTIRE life, from formal classrooms, to observing the TV news of events I was personally experienced with, etc  Even
+advertising - having vast experience with a product - but seeing how "popualr" the adverrtising message was - and what it focused on.
+
+This is EXACTLY what Campbell is saying about Democracy!
+"The majority's function in relation to the spirit is to try to listen and to open up to someone who's had an experience beyond that of food, shelter, progeny, and wealth. "
+
+Of course, the popular and "educated" answer - from our conformity schools of education - is that the speaker must alwys improve their speaking. And further, we must elect
+better speakers - as that's the problem of religion and democracy.
+
+Campbell is one of the very few in history to ISOLATE this - and his 1000 heroes (book title, counting) is peple of this order.  He's open sourcing
+the 1000 heroes before him - and explaining the euqation to EVERYONE in example after example.
+
+A film like Tideland - people scathingly insult the film - but ignore that it's a unqiue film.  It is clearly not going for
+viseral "Jump scares" or splshing "red blood shock" over the screen.  It's psyche truth - and can help you confront the horrors
+of warfare, parenting, childhood **BEFORE YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE**.  This is the best possible art there is, a preventative
+understanding of WHY not to do things - instead of just the fragile religion view of WHAT not to do (commadments and rules).
+It's the difference between memorizing a book (sounds in another language, such as a non-Japanese langage knower who memorizes
+an audio-book) and UNDERSTANDING the book.  Campbell puts forth that 99.999%, all but 1000 in 1949, fialed this understanding
+and I think the ratio is less today.  Because we "believe" that Edawrd Bernays propeganda, advertising, doesn't work on us personally
+just as people "blieved" there was 2 schools of Christianity (Protestant or Catholic) and 2 schools of Islam (Shia or Sunni)
+- ignoring the very pattern of side-taking and mob mentality!
+
+People enjoy fighting, so very much, that they fight through proxy!
+
+They are FINE to stop fighting personally, because they identify with a GROUP - and proxy fights go on for them.
+
+They fund the proxy fights.
+
+1. Women who take each other out and proxy-fight against husbands.  Group vs. group (completely ignorning the Troubadour Identity of the INDIVIDUAL tht is UNIQUE to Western tradition - and INCLUDED in the wedding vows).
+2. Technical teams 
+3. Sports tems fans
+4. Corporations
+5. Nation-states
+6 Political parties
+
+It's fractal in nature, because it's the ego of the mind itself, that is pushed.  WHY? Because I'm saying humans are evil and ego is evil?
+
+NO - I actually don't belive this.  I believe there is a more fundamental equation being played out, and throughout history it is broken
+in fragments - but we have faield to listen to people like Campbell who have identified the pattern of fragments.  The anti-pattern.
+

+Who runs the Enmpire, pulls the strings?
+
+> [USA] There may not be as few as 10 or even 100 of them, and they probably don't have official meetings, but you can bet the USA is essentially controlled by a network of government officials and corporate executives, whether they know it or not.
+
+The point isn't that there is a small number of people controlling the majority. It's that the top tier has a second tier of replacements right behind them. That the very system of prized values - feeds a kind of generic archetype of psychology, a generic personality. Competitiveness ensures that if you got rid of the top people - there are plenty of second-tier opportunist ready to take over.
+Steve Jobs, having roamed the top himself, actually spoke truth on it - and even double-emphasizes that it was truth:
+“When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” ― Steve Jobs
+I personally worked for the 3rd richest person on the planet, just meters from their office, and can relate entirely to the equation Jobs is presenting (and it obviously goes far beyond media).
+
+----------
+
+Let's go further.  Campbell identifies the founding fathers as having understood this equation - and wishing that democracy
+be founded on NEW THINKING SYSTEM - not just a new set of laws.  Laws change, are precise, new THINKING system
+is a far bigger and deeper change - that Stephen HOllar backs up as having been ignored.
+
+Non-instrumental Reason.
+
+(As an aside, he also can explain perhaps why a gorup of men was able to understand it. "Read other people's myths, not those of your own religion, because you tend to interpret your own religion in terms of facts -- but if you read the other ones, you begin to get the message." - that perhaps their journey to the Americas
+was a rather rare historic occourance, experincing Native Americans, etc.  Hard to prove, but I would suggest that the teachnique
+technique of going outside their own helped a lot.)
+
+So, how does it work.  Let's take Steve Job's quote literally fora moment.  If you killed the king of England - wouldn't
+a small number of pshyce control-freaks come along from the Roman Empire and take over?  The Ottoman Empire too? The Mongrals?
+
+See, even if you HAD a democracy of peer to peer - no leader - some psyche control-freak who fetishes large empirs (penise SIZE)
+is going to come along.  The one who desires greed most i the one to keep trying ot take over "empty" and "unclaimed" land.
+It's Campbell's heoroes, the 1000 he counts, that realize this mistake - and speak the real truth - that the problem
+is the majority - controlling all of us.
+
+Mohammad is not like Hitler in his message.  Mohammd speaks both that LOVE is highest, the abstract of God, and war is high.
+When does Hitler speak of God - he would be immediately pro-Jewish.
+
+When does the NEWS tell you that "love is absent in this school shooting" - because they find no profit in encourage you to
+sit around and talk Love - and not be consuming fast food, pills, and the pretty faces of the news reporters.  That's what Steve Jobs
+is also illustrating - the news is selling people what they WANT - because people sure don't want to turn it off.
+The same with all shallow politics too - sell violence and identity of flag - instead of individual - because if you sell
+indivdiual identity - you have no enemy - you just have complexity.  Steve Jobs is saying - people want simplicity - and the Apple
+company was the best at taking man's most complicated work - billiosn of bytes of source code - and turning it into one-button
+mouse or one-botton phones.

+
+The concept of "Thought Provoking" - and "pulling emotional strings" and "emotionally manipulative" and even "we are at war, we are not at war"
+
+When exactly is humanity dong god things when it is "not Thought Provoking"?  That there is no such thing as
+"Violence Provoking", "Lust Provoking" and other Chacras.
+
+you can ban "hate speech" but that implies that "Thought Provoking" isn't also "Hate Speech".  That advertsing and marketing isn't
+"Purchasing Provoking" or "Behavior Provoking".
+
+===========
+
+My personal problem with "the human world" is that we are so resistent to the Steve Jobs truth, Campbell truth, etc.
+
+We fight wars over it, attack schools, divorce, etc.  Really, it's one central problem causing all these conflcts.
+
+We would rather FIGHT to change brains, or move out (divorce) to change our brain, than actully translate from Buddha to Jesus, or husband to wife.
+
+And, as a democracy, we can't peer to peer enough to NOT favor this Psyche control-freeks we put at the top.  We all fall in line, against
+each other, in a mob fashion - and fight each other in the name of non-cooperation (poison competitiveness).
+
+Some artists have outright spoken of this frustration I personally feel:
+
+"Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man."
+
+That the SPEAKER is always at fault - and not the education system. The LIttle Prince, is in fact, an education system on this very
+problem of "mob self awareness" - just as James Joyce's work and Joseph Campbell.
+
+-----------
+
+It's funny that I so often get criticizes for my personal speech and expressions on "non-Instrumetal Reason" as defined by Campbell.
+
+1. Almost nobody else expresses that there is no longer any "outside group"
+2. Almost nobody else talks about the history of all humanity, all geography, in the "in-group vs. out-group" psychology.
+3. Even when I do present OTHER PEOPLE's WORDS, or point it out in a POPULAR Art fil ("Interstellar) - it gets attacked.
+4. Even if I point out the pattern of attack (James Joyce's own fans, True Detective Season 2 from fans of SEason 1) people don't want to discuss it and atack me for speaking up.
+5. Even when I do not SPEAK - and just SEEK others commenting on the pattern (James Joyce's own fans, True Detective Season 2 from fans of SEason 1, Democrat vs. Republican team polarity - killng peer to peer Reason, Christian vs. Protestant temp plarity - killing Gnostic) i find almost none!   Even marraiges - the PATH (Mohammad) of relatonships vs. "this woman is bad" (where is Forgiveness, Compassion, and mutuality in divorce?).

-
-THIS IS WHY People can not recognize the high-fuction autistic's intelligence and success with their lack of friendships and failed marriages. And few have sought out work like Joseph Campbell's on religion to have the vocabularly and self-awareness to be able to articulate it.  We have mostly been left with
-the family members, medical practitioners, and university-studied academics to try and describe it from the outside.

-Put simply, we are trying to balance the whole society - and squeeze between the ever changing cracks of what we see
-
-Timolthy Leary's equation of LSD brain barrier, subconsious exposure, to computing is precisely why so many autistics . Life is like a video game, we didn't really wish to have to play. In my personal case, I wish that mercy, love and compassion were far m
-ore better tools - and understanding and learning viewed as a mutual experience. For me, every day is learning, and the pain of some lessons is very high. Most often when it is people (warfare between nations) or interpersonal (marriages, divorces, families, etc).
-
-There are hundreds of books on autism, but no unified recognition. Joseph Campbell is a perfect example using the field of religion. Each society has it's concept of it, but really will not translate fro Buddha to Jesus. They will translate from French to Japanese but not deeper. And that is precisely the barrier problem of Autism. All these independent books cliaming to tell the biggest understandings of Autism - but really missing the points. Children are trying to be assimilated to the society, that's an objective of indotrination / expectation of society behavior. With the high-fuctioning adults - you are dealing with a lifelong of failures of friendships, family situations, and aspects of technical life.
-You can argue that the depression is a symptom of reaction and misunderstanding (being harsh about it, bigotry) and it's nearly impossible to escape.
-Like religious persecution (being out of your own religious in-group), homosexuality (in a unwelcome area of the planet), or skin color / racial conflicts (historic slavery).  These metaphors are not exagerations!!
-Autistics are often in exile from their own very mother and father, READ THE BOOKS!  Book after book is about a mother who can not seem to bond with her own very child! Seeking medical and proessional assistance due to this massive divide!
-All due to the mind, not due to an ugly face, missing limb child birth defect, or similar!
-Is it possible to have a mind from another planet? Isn't that the very metaphor of Jesus and Buddha, Martin Luther King Jr, Ghandi, and Malala?
-Yet those just trying to live everyday life are not able always able to articualte the experience of such deep conflicts with their own family, jobs and society, and the constant pain of it
-is previous in time, current, and anticipated rationally in the future!
-
-Frankly, autism itself had to swith to a concept of spectrum because so many people were arguing about the degrees of it. And this is also the problem with the autistic and the humans in his life - they seem to find it far easier
-to just dismiss it, to adjust the volume level from 11 to 9 and say it isnt' as bad as it seems - and to scold the person who can never seem to balance their Life. And has to live without
-the real best joys of romatic relationships - and perhaps even the joy of religion.  For me personally, I see so many people fighting over religion, it's a constant struggle
-to see "God" as the one escape. To me, it's instruction and education on not fighting "love your enemy", "love your brother", not just 1 hour on Sunday, but every hour of the week
-and well - it sure isn't easy for us, and why should you think it ever was easy?
-
-The group "autism speaks" uses advertising and markting and corruptive influence. By no means does it speak truth, it's often mothers wishing to heal their children.
-To ignore humanities greatest psycologists, such as Jesus and Buddha, and modern Martin Luther King Jr - Joseph Campbell, Timothy Leary -- all fully compatible with Carl Jung
-is to ignore how complicated and diverse the world really is.  Campbell can be quoted on ths directly, the concept of neurodiversity:
-
-"There are something like eighteen billion cells in the brain alone. There are no two brains alike; there are no two hands alike; there are no two human beings alike. You can take your guidance and instruction from others, but you must find your own path."
-Joseph Campbell, in Pathways to Bliss
-
-
-Stephen Hollar uses the perfect example of this when he talks about the artist by society. How the left and right fight each other, in a ideals war, leaving the non-greedy artist - the truth teller in the middle.
-I have seen autistics parody non-autistics as liers, who seek friendship at any cost, and their mocking of autism (
-
-So you are left with this type of equation constantly
-
-  1. Do I put the feelings of others at risk for my own personal needs
-  2. Does misunderstanding itself cause pain. When you are talking about a 3 month plan but everyone's listening is geared toward 3 weeks.
-  3. That life it iself uncertain, and in your view things are happening all over the world that are uncontrolled, yet you are expected to listen only to ones that favor your self - and to segregate. Segregation in the sense of races, groups, emotions. "Compartmentalization"
-
-Is all this a heavy weight to carry! Of course it is, as Stephan Hollar said - "it hurts like heck". And This is what the Autism books are saying.
-
-Of course, when facing a multi-year decision, such as a marriage path that resulted in failure. It overwhemes even people without Autism.
-
-you personally can take religion ideals very deeply. you see conflicts between people, even complete strangers. You read 20 movie reviews of the same cinema flick, and you find conflict everywhere. You read reviwes of a 20 year old film at the time of it's writing, especially futuristic science ficiton, and you see how receptive people were to ideas and each other. You see 8 critics from 20 years ago, and how the conflict evolves and changes.
-You even read about the religion wars, and how 200 years ago the attitude was toward a scientific idea - such as bacteria impacting the outcome of a surgery.
-Artists also express these same things (the film "12 Monkeys" uses that idea of bacteria in surgery of previous time periods).
-Carl Segan points out that a tree and a human share DNA/RNA aspects, and all evidence points to us evolving out of the same basic building blocks.
-Yet, that idea has so angered people and created so many conflicts for thousands of years. How can it be that living tree is similar to me?
-
-You take these deepest religion ideals - and you try very hard - to never hold hate. You become angry. You know frustration rather well, But hate is sustained. Hate is lasting, hate is a military campaign. Hate is organized, structured, orchistrated, composed, created, authored.
-Frustration, anger, these are far more spontaneous and perhaps unavoidable. What religion is good without true compassion, it it's literal meaning of shared suffering, and of course - true forgiveness.
-But you do start to hate systems, machinerly, logical platforms, and dogma and orthodoxy (often orthodoxy A conflicting with orthodox B).
-You, your own self, may not be flexible, but you don't make a religion of trying to make others *less flexible*.
-You know very much the value of flexiblity in others, and how necissary it is to your happiness. It is this very equation that opens your own
-compassion and understnading of Buddha and Jesus equations ("lvoe your enemy").
-However, things like systems - for me - advertising, marketing, tax systems - their impersonal demands you can develop a hate.
-Never do you constroct a plan of attack, violence or even a desire of negativity. What you strive for is truth, often at great personal pain. But you sure may write and speak a lot on the subject, and the general problem
-of institutions vs. individuals and how they can somehow seem to breed personal misery for those who don't make it to the top 20% and 
-are not cheered for their achevement.
- 
-balancing these, of course, is imppossible. Unintended compromises bite at you, intended ones seem impossible choices.
-No monk or priest can do this, short of pure isolation in a monstary or on a mountain. How can you achieve it? Self-segreation, self-exile
-is the only path of an autistic?  I've personally failed two marriages with completely unhappy outcomes.
-As Campbell summerizes from religion, there is no life without Pain. Loss is part of the equation, and at least if you are going to
-take a trip into hell (social conflicts) you should speak Truth and seek real Love like a Troubadour artists. Even if you
-are the most unpopular artist in the city.
-
-To try to prepare people for this, to prepare your partner, you turn to thick volumes like Tolstoy's War and Peace, and Don Quiote. But
-really you wish they understand that for you, it's the full bookshelf, not just a couple thick books. And as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr' says
-there is nothing more frustrating or bewildering that good-will partners who do not take you seriously in understanding the path you are
-undertaking. You sure don't wish to forget love's joy, like Leo B so loudly proclaims from his pulpit. What's the point of a marriage,
-of such an ordeal and a path, if you never have fun and joy. If you only conflict, war - you are like a religion gone bad.  An autistic
-would never wish this outcome, or this journey. A Troubadour may embrace the pain of Love, but to have a marriage where Love never exists
-that's just terrible for all the earth. That's a failure of understanding. That's precisley a bad religion. 
-That's why the entire bookshelf must be understood. It is an adult choice, a human choice, to deal with those painful emotions together
-as partners  - and why you can seem so happy to have a book to quote - explaining that you knew this pain before-hand. It is not
-"I told you so", it's a relief that there exists an understanding of who we are, and the paths we can choose.
-Alas, this is a  path that has failed me 3 times in my adulthood, and at some point, I can feel that no warning can serve the pain
-of such a path with me.
-
-Now you must face a very different equation. That personal Love is not the force. You are now facced with the love of Everyone. It was there
-all along - but it isn't easy. As familiarity with the individual may work in a personal Love, Troubadour AMOR - but in loving everyone - familiarity and expectations
-If you are honest, marketing and advertising seem poison to you. You speak truth.
-
-
-You are spending so much effort trying to master the waves of your own mind, of your own soul and spirit, that non-truths and deceptions almost never prove as shortcuts.
-You are much more forced to deal with time itself. Can someone learn an entire book in 20 minutes? Everything becomes a spectrum and degree
-of understanding.  And you always seem to be on the weak side of the equation, requiring more understanding than others are offering.
-
-Campbell, on why do people seek out religion, why does it arrise in all our cultures:
-
-For me, survival is constant. Ouroboros spinning, sunrise and sunset. You are always one social screwup from being in total homeless exile.  People expect you to mature and improve.
-They do not see that often artists and musicians often have very difficult times after age 35. In essence, you feel like an artists with zero
-profit potential. You see your self heading to institutional living, prison or mental health - impersonal, lacking freedom, and discarded by the society.
-If you could write a book, why really wants to read about how terrible humanit social systems are - and that Jesus and Buddha were right all along
-and anything short of true peer to peer Democracy is not working for everyone, all persons, all individuals.
-It's such a difficult problem, it's bad news.
-
-"And what is wanted is not simply one, two or three meals a day and a bed—that's not enough. It's got to be much more than that to make a life."
-
-Often Autistics use metaphors like being stuck in a glass cage. Able to witness others in their conflicts but happy.
-You don't enjoy the conflict but people seem to always end up concluding that you do. You are, such a source of it, something they
-can't reconcile and accept. You seem like the Devil, not the Eye of God.  Yet, your experience is the very reasons for your choices
-and your observations and so many failed attempts to slip through the cracks of the moving Rubix Cube of society.
-Society is always changing!  peole did not dress and have electricity 150 years ago as they did today! Every society on earth has transformed
-yet when you point this out - people become defensive and the society immune system kicks in. It is always improving is their perspective
-but then how manys aid that shortly before another war began against another society? You don't see sides in wars, you see War and Peace
-and to you - you want Peace. You want people to stop interpreting mistakes as attacks, and you want people to stop being so
-competitive to the point of war with you and each other.
-
-Your dislike for the competition puts you in such conflict with other people's values. To you, Joy and Love are not competitive, they are
-mutually beneficial games. And you are not "gaming the system", you are just the handicapped player.  This is the point of Jesus and Buddha
-eduation - only from God's eye can you see such handicaps as part of life. We can choose to remove decepiton, lies, marketing, advertising
-and speak Truth - but we msut all disarm the war.
-
-To hold a religious mental ideal, "Head in the Clouds" does not make you immune from hellbound personal choices. You are, essentially, living in a state of conflict with your own society at all times. Your own personal friends, your own family, again - like the bookshelf of Autism books are essentily illustrating in each their own spectrum of viewpoints.
-I hold strong ideals for world peace, peer to peer Love, as it's also my bet personal hope for relationships. But it's exceedingly painful to
-hold that same compassion for every stranger, including the ones you read about and witness on television, film, songs, etc. You are out of accord with your own society, "head in the clouds" and
-wish not for the fighting based on Religion (fighitng over how to read a book) and family (strong emotions gone the wrong path). To be out of such accord is painful, as Campbell points out from past
-who have tried to hold such strong positions:
-
-"If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn't, you've got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you."
-
-Autism is to live outside interpreted, mainstream, experience. And as Campbell has noted of those who do so:
-
-"They've moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original experience has not been interpreted for you, and so you've got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it o
-
-Is it a choice? Well, we can self-segregate from society. We can become like a Monk, minmizing desires all the time, self-isolation, self-exile from society. But this can be equally painful, as isn't so much a personal ideal and choice
-as a reality of how much conflict your own self causes others. You don't hate people, they just don't enjoy or like you (again this is the reality of the Autsim bookshelf, and should not be dismissed
-with poorly placed short-term views).  AS MLK Jr said, "Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection." -- to read my words, my view of the autism bookshelf - and to dismiss that on half-understanding is to have failed to properly listen.
-
-In my life, the years 2012-2015, I can say that I not only lived at the bottom of the barrel, but below it. The hell of Tristan and Isolde, I can personally
-describe. Now, of course, I know of paths out of it, but they are incredibly painful.  The film "What Dreams May Come" describes such a trip into hell, and here I must
-exit alone (where in the film, that is not the outcome, but still incredibly painful).

They constantly change advertising artists and presentation of the product - measuring which one is most effective in convincing the consumer to hand over their money.  Their intention is profits - to manipulate the masses to purchase from a factory and put wealth (money) into the hands of the owners (in various forms). 
-
-Yet, I almost see nobody on reddit speak out that advertising has a measurable influence on the consumption of unhealthy foods. In particular, the over-consumption of terrible things like sugar water (Coke) and fried potatoes.  That scenes of happy healthy people are being used to psychologically sell products - when any serious consideration knows that the regular consumers of such products are not of this same physical appearance.
-
-These foods are not very good for health and designed to appeal heavily to the immediate taste sensations. They sell not because they are quality, they sell primarily due to the appeal (keep offering new products until you find one that the human brain can't resist) - to take money and mental attention away from other choices of food to consume.
-
-America has weaponized advertising *as an education system* and product placement (within films), etc.  In poor countries, this kind of thing can be imported rapidly and have dramatic impacts.  It creates jealousy, "bling bling" flaunting of wealth (look at the wealthy Gulf nations and their princes), and other behaviors that the religion specifically teaches as factors that create society tension.
-
-In America singing may be allowed in a Church, but in Islam there is no such thing. Even the introduction of radios, music players, has destabilized the religion. The technology of  recorded and broadcast music competes directly with the education systems of the religion (chanting and repetition of the prayer).  You will find this same thing with Elvis in America from Christians.  But with Islam, it's far worse, as you have no equal to Gospel music that slow down the impact.  
-
-It's not exactly irrational to say that the external culture is specifically targeting every person in the society for the sole sake of profiteering off the poor education and lack of preparedness.  Food technology is just one simple example of this problem, it gets far more complicated when you look at things like sexual practices and pornography sellers (which profits the internet website owners via advertising page views, again a small number of people who profit - and care only about the increase of their bank account balance).  Suddenly teen pregnancy rates start to increase, in a society where birth control often isn't even yet on the radar.  These kinds of things set off *big* emotional reactions. They have very large families in these traditional cultures, and everyone is going to talk when sex is discovered out of wedlock.
-
-FIFA has a massive influence on a lot of poor countries (in both the Americas and in Islamic lands). They flaunt wealth and all kinds of "bling bling" things - and are backed by a lot of the same food and luxury sellers.  Fast food sellers (including drinks) don't sponsor sporting events and the Olympics from the bottom of their hearts, it's a deliberate psychological manipulation to associate with healthy (extremely non-typical) athletes and expensive actors.
- 
-All of this is done by individuals, it isn't government to government, it's citizen to citizen.  And that seems to be what they are attacking - outside education systems.  If you can't see that advertising, product packaging, sponsor logos, and marketing are "education systems" - well, maybe you just think they are magic fairy dust that generates profits. Because there is a ton of denial in America about Edward Bernays systems of education and it's negative impacts (making the rich richer, and the mentally depressed and poor obese is just one simple example).
-
--------------
-
-Religion is an education system, a mosque is a school.  Campbell is your reference on all this. To keep arguing over these very simple ideas
-is to disagree without reason. It is to fight instead of actually learn. It is to resist truth! And people DO resist truth! There have
-been wars over religion books, including people who agree on the same book (Quran). To continue to ignore this very problem of
-people fighting and murdering over poetry books is to not see we are talking about your own mind, brain system.
-do not fall into "I am better than those people", this isn't about who you are or what part of Earth's geography or even the technology
-you use.  This is about educaiton systems. And advertising, marketing is an educaiton system too.  If this equivlance can not be draw
-if there is such an allegance to the popularity of a system (religion or advertising) then the problem will not be seeen.
-And things lay as they are, in darkness, wher.e it is "just those stupid people who hate".
-Dr. Martin Luther King Jr time and time again said - that's the very problem, the divisive thinking of "us vs. them" and not looking at
-the interaction - and what has changed both positive and negative in the interaction.
-
-Dr. King's approach to violeance was not the obvious and popular pattern of 1) Run away, move to another city. Don't travel to those areas.
-2) Fight back with force of ecnomics or with violeance. These are military and political forces.  He faught with psycology, education!
-But not subversive psycology of advertising, but with truth and light.  He was saying, in essence, that:
-
-1. People of diffeent races are equal
-2. Education systems at the basis of attitudes are not
-3. That Love and Compassion were falsly educated as "in-group" only. That Jesus' words had been maleducated, propeganda, to divide the races.
-4. Circumstances and timelines had created inequalities as we see them today, but we must change to heal future timelines.
-
-These very same things can be applied to Islam and American Advertising
-
-Falsehoods in advertising are hurting america. Our own denial is part of the problem!  We think overprized pharamasutial, prison populations, and obesity are strictly classroom problems
-but ignore the wealth-flaunting educaiton of our popular singers, actors, atheletes, corporate owners, etc. We do not view these as education
-systems!  Baseball IS an educaiton system! Singers ARE educating children! Films do educate and change society!
-
-Do people really think you sit in Mathmatics class and learn Algebra - and it is used that next week?  No, it may be used 30 years later. And the same with a film.
-To measure a film's impact on last weekend's box office ticket sales revenu is to measure only the most easiest and countable. The impact
-may not be felt for decades!  Just like that Algabra educaiton at age 16.

+Ideas and Learning
+
+Let's say we agree:
+
+1. Driving a car requires learning, it isn't something a person understands (including road rules) without observatin of others or teaching of some kind.
+
+Let's say we agree:
+
+1. Speaking language, spelling pronciation, requires larning
+2. Makeup, fashion, dress requires learning
+
+But we behave as if one of these is the least improtant.  That driving a car we meet the bare minimum - we are good!
+
+yet, we murder people driving a car.  Including our own family which we claim to lvoe more than anything.  yet, do we openly
+discuss this risk to our family, no.
+
+Intead, we openly discuss with our family the importance of their haircuts, makeup, fashion.  We do openly discuss if they
+have stains on their clothes.  But we do not discuss the rality that we may make a mistake in driving and kill our own family someday.
+
+
+Why?
+
+Popularity.  Others talk about makeup and fahsion, and have for 1000 years or longer.  But how long have people talked about driving
+safety - and how they murdered their family?  It just isn't in the popular mind - and if it were brought up directly, people become
+defensive - instead of facing the truth.
+
+If it becomes popular to get more education, people do it, example of driving in Germany https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3p99wc/til_that_first_aid_training_is_mandatory_in/

+> It's surprising and disappointing to see how poorly planned and executed that this documentary turned out to be. Malala and her cause deserve better and so does the audience.
+
+I think it's the highest praise possible. It tries to show the complexity of her world and experience.  Let it inspire 10 more films by 10 other people be made. 30 films, 50 films.  How much does **any society** real give a shit about her and her message?  Lip service and pedestals don't serve Martin Luther King, Jr any more than Malala. 
+
+“If you want someone to be ignored then build a life-size bronze statue of them and stick it in the middle of town. It doesn't matter how great you were, it'll always take an unfunny drunk with climbing skills to make people notice you.” ― Banksy, Wall and Piece
+
+How come every day on the news I hear about a bombing in Pakistan - but no mention of Malala?  The **Taliban wants you to focus on death and killing** -- guess what the News Sellers also focus on **death and killing, action violence visceral explosions**.   Joseph Campbell: "And so we are now on one side of the pyramid. We've moved from one to two. We are politically, historically, now a member of one side of an argument."
+
+Let me repeat that: The Taliban has "discovered" that the key to controlling people is to bomb education buildings, attack personal individual expression, and dramatically murder and keep people obsessed with death and fear of death.  The News Reporters have also "discovered" that the key to controlling (the purchasing, profit making) of people is to dramatically show murders, killing, and the fear of death.
+
+Who is teaching Compassion, Love, Forgiveness?  Not the News reporting on the Taliban - I sure don't here them talking about "Today, a failure of forgiveness and understanding resulted in a bombing of a Mosque in Swat Valley".  Nope, it's all political and economics and body counting - all pure logic that sells.  Funny, that's exactly how the Taliban thinks - in pure simplistic arguments that lack: Compassion, Forgiveness, and Love. 
+
+Why does forgiveness get torn out of the News Reporters story? Because it's complicated and painful to the ego of the mind.  Why does the Taliban tear out Forgiveness from the Quran - because it's complicated and painful to the ego of the mind.
+
+> Who's the "he" of the film's title and what's the significance of Malala's name?
+
+Allah? Allah has 99 names, etc. And her Father? If you can't see that the film is raising questions **deliberately** then you have missed the point.  To treat this just like 2 hours of your Humanities class - and not walk outside the theater - is to fall into exactly what Banksy is criticizing with art (be it fiction or documentary, we are dealing with real killing truth here - not like a documentary of a dead person such as JFK).
+
+To think you can make a documentary that shows a living, still-alive, person like This (alive spiritually) is a task of absurdity.  The use of animation and cutting back/forth is true to the topic. And it isn't **bad writing and stupid story telling** - the story is a living universe inside the mind of this person.  And you are being invited to share in her perception of the world.  Her *experience*.
+
+This film has no conscious meaning because her life has no conscious logical structured meaning.  The meaning is to be alive.  The answer to the death obsession of the News Reporters and the death obsession of the Taliban - is to be alive.  The film is a documentary of both the audience subconscious and Malala's subconscious experience.  She **comes alive** by not being trapped in a literal reading of the Quran.
+
+"People say that what we're all seeking is a meaning for life. 1 don't think that's what we're really seeking. I think that what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive." (Campbell, explaining that religion isn't about answers, but experience)
+
+The Taliban and the News Reporters are selling you one side of the pyramid. One side of an argument.  That Death is your highest concern and most newsworthy thing to talk about.  The story of Malala is that she became alive, like a flower growing in a dry land. And the film depicts that complicated non-narrative truth that can not be told in A-B-C-E-D twist and structure fashion.
+
+It's a great film and it should leave you questioning all the other films... and questioning the very kind of thinking that made you have structured expectations of a film.

-Monomyth as a Sperical Encryption Key to the human brain
-
-I believe that metaphors can be related to fuse-blowing memories of pre-programmed myth.
-
-Myth being keys to cultural-specific icons, language, etc. And all the brain talents, such as dance, music, multi-lingual, autism/sevant,
-are exposures to non-restrained keys of generic or post-birth expressive development.
-
-the Monomyth is the key, if you could coidfy the sphere of the entire Bible, as James Joyce was doing and Campell
-expressed in Skelaton Key to Joyce's work.  As the review on Amazon stated, you start to read ALL BOOKS as The Wake.
-Just as I hve personally said that the role of the Quran is to read other material to Rajaa. That it is a tool of other tools.
-
-The TV series "The Code" uses a Church, an example of how artists were living and relating to the Monomyth - and were able
-to translate the "sound of the universe" as they heard it in their mind, to the construction of this particular featured church building.
-
-As Campbell and Jung say, all Myths have common themes that can be cross-referenced. A type of Rosetta Stone of a Monomyth can be created
-based on metaphors of each society cross-referenced. Devil, God, Prayer Day, Virgin Birth, etc.
-I believe The Eye of Reason, a non-binary value can be gated inside the mind - but most people these days, especialy computer
-cryptography thinkers and systems, are pure binary 0/1 inside their brain. But I imagine a trinagle logic holder of some sorts
-that could crack all known keys (like the theme of the film Sneakers). I have been able to create a virtualized pycological
-representation of this in my own mind for temporary periods and been able to peer into my own subconsious one
-and relate it to the symbols of my own culture (music from the Midwest I could deeply connect with) as Campbell describes
-that an artist can do with myth.  But my operating system training and understanding of software side of a hardware view
-(which is what consiousness, the perceived software perspective of a hardware brain) helped me recognize the significance
-of Campbell and Joyce creating a new myth - The Wake - and how Campbell has been able to apply much of the pattern
-from his own mind into the world-wide religions.
-
-Campbell himself had installed a type of meta-debugger that allowed him to peer into his own personal subconsious OS. he described his own
-as a light debugger, maybe a kind of user-app debugger as opposed to a harder kernel-mode debugger.  He used the term "slow burning rapture"
-in terms of his own personal mind.
-
-I think I tapped into the kernel-mode debugger, the Mystic one he describes, or "A Saint" one he describes in PoM.  But I had my yonng-age
-understanding of oprating systems that even Timothy Learly lacked, and surely Campbell lacked (hiw focus was on literate, metaphor of
-communications - not my personal metaphors of human interaction with binary machines).  The brain is NOT binary, that is clear to me
-but it surely had some experinece of cascading fuses like EEPROM being progrrammed.  I could see gates being burned
-and searching for Monomyth themes. For example, I would play a song and sense a pattern search of other similar songs
-that had the same Myth-chunking in a kind of b-tree or linear search.  Like trying to remember someone's name
-from a face.  But I also sense some circules had gone from left/right turns (A or B logic, binary) to a tri-state of
-infinate.  Like going from one data structure to another.  A self-awareness of Monomyth had developed a kind of brain defense
-system that you see depcited by the Nolan Brothers as a "hardened mind" in Inception.
-
-So i ould traverse into the song perspetive of the artist, seeing the perfect Monomyth pattern of the song (a 3 or 4 mintue song probably only using 2 or 3 of the Monomyth Metaphor chunks.
-Unlike say 20 hour True Detective + Interstellar 3 hours, which I felt almost hit on 70% of them or something - like 3000 Monomyth segments?)
-
-Pi describes a flat circle, but that's not enough. I feel the Monomyth brain key is a sphere. I don't know math enough, but is
-there some insane crazy number even a e=mc^2 magnitute beyond pi for a sphere? A Flatland kind of pi?  I expect
-it has soemthing to do with how a black hole feeds into big bang(s).
-
-Are there e=mc^2 dimensioanl fractals? That go more than just the expanding, but multi-dimensions like beyond Flatland?
-
-In Pi, the number never repeat. So that's like a super-duper Prime number. So existing ecnryption is built on Primes
-but that's not enough. The human brain, monomyyth sperical encryption, goes many dimensions further to where each is a kind of pi
-like number (think of Primes as Flatland, and MonoMyth sperical chunks as an order beyond Flatland - like Pi).
-
-perhaps Monomyth, our own brain, has i in it, imaginary numbers. They are metaphors of the mythologies. And all art, all myths, can reveal
-the chunks by cross-reference.  Like the church shown in "The Code" was built to hosue music notes.
-
-radar waves and return use imaginary numbers, so too does the black hole to big-bang traversal?
-
-Knowing the monomyth code would crack stock markets and weather patterns equal. And our hormone tables (offset by internal clocks).
-
-oh yes, star patterns of the southern and northern hemisphere are one of the monomoth keys. So we stand outside and we calibrate
-summer and winter ant some point in our mental development.  There are a series of perhaps 20 star patterns / light patterns
-in the Monomyth key. True Detective Season 2 had one.
-
-
-EDIT: Maybe triangle logic is wrong. The bees 2nd hour of "The Code" talks about Hex shape. Maybe intead of a binary gate
-there is an infinate holding logic gate (analog) of a hex shape.  So whatever flatland world digital computers live in
-a hex shape equivlant like a beehive honeycomb.
-
-Campbell said that he felt each symbolf of a Myth existed: "Myths primarily are for fundamental instruction in these matters. Our society today is not giving us adequate mythic instruction of this kind, and so young people are finding it difficult to get their act together. I have a theory that, if you can find out where a person is blocked, it should be possible to find a mythological counterpart for that particular threshold problem."
-
-Jackson Pollick created Fractal art work, and criticis ego vomited. James Joyce created Fractal literature, and critics ego vomited.
-Truth upsets people. Troubadours speak truth.

-Schedules are the worst part. You are expected to be predictable and reliable. To perform, in essence, like a machine for most jobs.
-And things like monthly bills, yearly taxes, etc are considered routine. Yet, of course, these are often what divide the highly
- successful from the line workers. Bottom-tier workers only cash their checks, it's far more paperwork to do payroll and txes
- for the business.
-Hiring help becoems interpersonal, and a weak area like paperwork can become bound in negative emotions.
-
-So, you are left with this essential conflict: You may enjoy to work independent, but you can not maintain the required extra paperwork
-  and systems of indeepndence. Maintaing bran identities, business relationships, accounting, taxes, etc.
-  A lot of very talented artists and musicians, with great social skills and such, have fallen into this trap.
-  Evading taxes not out of greed, but out of what the society considers neglegence.
-  Really, it's more that the society does not account for certain personality types, as Stephan Hollar says in
-  his review of Art and Left vs. Right ideals.  yet, the value of these independent people in transforming the society
-  in non-greedy ways is perhaps entirely underestimated. Not only would the individuals be more happy with more personal

-   from the independent thinking and creativity.  Time and time again we find this. The contented and integrated loner is
-   better than the isolated shunned and unhappy creative loner (who may become a terrorist or seek negative attention
-   through recogniton of that as a quicker and easier path).
-
-To put it as bluntly as possible, confronting the detnial of you the reader and the society; Terror and fear has taken over. Where men used to travel
-across the world for the sake of education and learning - now people are fearful and afraid.
-We somehow think suicide is always murder-suicide. That Suicide is equal to homicide.  No, this is not true.
-An artist or musician who overdoses alone in their hotel room is not a homicide risk.  Yes, there can be domestic violence issues
-but honesty and truth - and better listening is often the artists most frustration.  Again, back to Martin Luther King Jr who was
-a great artists - street performer - public figure - who had his own share of martial problems, but he spoke truth of what frustrates
-this peace-loving mind:
-
-"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."
-
-Which is the general problem of religion conflicts!  you have Islam followers attacking each other in the middle east, and in Northern Ireland the same fighting patterns emerge. This is domestic violence on a society scale. Civil war.
-
-So being "extreme" does not account for peace! And that's the problem!  Fear and Terror, the terorizing of emotions, is to ignore the good pages of religion:
-
-1. If there is violence, do not add fear. Jesus said - turn the other cheek. And to do so repeat. This is the same message as MLK Jr.
-2. Fear creates more fear. That's the back/forth violence pattern of the middle east and ireland.
-3. Removing the GOOD of a religion is failure. A) Forgiveness, b) Compassion, C) Tolerance, D) Listening.  Being rigid, stubborn, punishing. They very idea of "judgement day" in religion is to remove punishment!
-
-It isn't subborn or lazy, it's REALITY of being autistic. Evetythign becomes a non-funny "comedy of errors" in how people react to you. LIke a mistplaced homosexual in a homophobic family.

+The side-effect is that "it fucks up peer to peer interaction, turning people into in-group out-group teams, haves and have not's, husband vs. wife, neighbor vs. neighbor" that is massive size, as in 230 out of 100!
+
+Hey, we killed an angry ape who escaped the zoo prison with a nuclear bomb - but also killed 7000 peaceful people - and made the spot of the earth unlivable for 9000 years.
+
+There truly are things in play that have "positive" efects that have far LARGEr and more SIGNIFICANT side-effets.
+
+This is why I am so focused on Edward Bernays techniques - because I think the side-effects are beyond super horrific.
+
+If we condition our selves, segregate our own etnertainment and art to only high-quality "best" - then we set our selves up to be
+manipulated.  We are anti peer to peer by nature, anti low-quality, "below average", anti demcratic ("We ALL the People").  It's just
+a matter of a evil manipulator personality to MIMIC that desired in-fashion narrow style perfectly - and that's exactly what I think
+dictators have done in the past!  If we so much fetish and desire "the best" as our ego defines it, we hunt and seek for awards
+and perfection as define at the moment - we have reduced all of humanity to a set of technical attributes - a list of desirables
+that can be seen by OTHERS wish to MANIPULAT and ENSLAVE us.
+
+Unless, of course, our ideal is accepting people as authentical individuals - and the neccisary patience, tolerance, and diversity
+that that requires.  IT DOES require more time to accomodate he less effice, less well-spoken, more off-key voices.

+Arrogance of society:
+

+
+But marriage I learn on the playground and shallow Soap Opera TV in a few hours!
+
+No, the evidence is shwoign us that education DOES matter in regards to Global Peace (anti-war) and marriage. But we play this
+ego defense, pride, that we don't need to learn.
+
+do people know the history of marriage? Do they know how arranged marriage works?  Real knowledge, with accuracy, or just playground
+education?
+
+Is marriage birth into animals - or a educaiton human written and structred creation - like Poetry and Films (that animals don't do)?

-Fear and Terror are the most powerful reactionary tools. To condition Reason and Love to be concearled. By constant emphasis
-on every nighttime, dark, the primal animal fear of the human brain (darwin evolution) comes out.
-Jesus knew this from observation, as did Buddha.  Their teaching specifically says this.
-I will walk through the vallye of the shadow of death, the fake fear illusion, and fear no evil.
-An unhappy divorce custody-battle society is always on edge, never getting forgiveness, never getting compassion.
-Only a few special celeberity cases are celebrated, but the average and such are left in constant state of anxiety
-and fear - knowing that forgiveness is weak, crumbling and broken.
-Of course this drives people into depression, creating nightmare dreams, and cerating a society.
-Military leaders love wars on drugs to free this psyche, self-learning. it must be given out by the holy clergy, the official
-patented wealthy drug manufactorus. Suicide and self-learning are concdemed.
-Fear is constantly emphasized, terror is always the topic, and car accidents and violence are praised as the ultimate joy and excitement.

+Redfined Ideals
+
+Terrorism teaches us in the most obvious way:
+
+1. God can be redefined to be centered around volence, action, fear
+2. Compassin, Love and Forgiveness can be excluded from education, and even a 14 year old child can be married or pick up a gun.
+
+But people are so afraid of irrational - if anything all this is HyperReal rational.
+
+1. After death there is nothing - show this dramatically by killing in front of people
+
+It's not hope for heaven they are teaching, and in ny way would they teach heaven is on earth (metaphor).
+
+THE BIGGEST Failure of the Observers is that it CAN be redefined.  IF we can redefine it, then Campbell is correct
+and we can EVOLVE and change it in our own lives and society.
+
+The real failure is to see: Education and understaning takes time. Memorization is faster but useless for religion - it might work
+fo memorizing how to cook a meal or something.  Guns and swords change brains in minutes, education can take years.
+
+We are NOT speaking these equations.  To condem violence, but support inquality attitudes, is to not learn our own self.
+
+-----------
+
+Redefined Meter and Kilogram examples:
+https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3po0jh/the_weight_is_over_the_kilogram_is_settled/
+
+The DSm-V is an outisde looking in approach, trying to interpret behavior.  it does not teach self-awareness
+it tries to:
+
+1. Hammer with institutionalization / confinement
+2. Hammer with drugs
+3. Hammer with society labels - and the very strong society fear and stigma against labbels (very important point)
+
+The psyche industry does not:
+
+1. Criticize avertising / whcih is directly pshycological. also product coloring, shapes, retail arrangement, etc
+2. Politicis of mass control - Edward Bernays - and mesmerising crowd-effects as something that is best BROKEN and anti-patterened in Democracy.
+3. Religion misunderstandings in warfare, bigotry, violence, etc
+
+This is what makes Phsyce mroe corrupt than anyone. Highly educated people who weaponize and conceal massive systems of control
+advertising being a general category of both poverty creation and warfare creation (Bernays practiced both).
+
+---------
+
+The Simpsons writers understand that art, education, is often a function of repetition.  They try their hardest to give away the secret to rich and wealthy - but what can you do?
+This is the paradox of our modern society. We do not view repetition, advertising, as education. And I also include variations
+like the Simpsons episodes themselves, on the same characters, etc.  They are mocking Mickey Mouse - and even it's
+inward reflection on the family.
+
+This is made most obious by the opening scene of Bart simpsons repeating on the chackboard.  The repeition in elementry school
+being the lowest form of eduction.  The same that literal religion relies on - and Zen Buddhism and Richard Feynman physics teaching
+entirely avoid (Feyman even being against uniform clothing and elaborate decoration of persons for the sake of trickery).
+
+You can say that dressing up kings and queens is just "fun" and it's a "spoil sport".  But we live in a world where
+the evidence shows that these are the very roots of warfare.  This is where I disagree with Campbell the strongest. He justifies
+oranized uniform warefare, following orders, while at the same time dtailing the religius msinterpretation brought about by
+conformity eeucation.  He shares experience and hints of Sarah Lawrence education differene (students standing up), but how many
+of Campbell's students actually live an outward-repetition of their experience?  Recognizing and standing up to the
+George Lucas corruption (nice ending of Jedi - that music score producer says was not the original) - and to the expanding influence
+of advertising - and worst of all, the faiure to see "Terrorism" = "Fear Mongering" inard interpretation of 9-11.  I never see
+Campbell referenced.
+
+Campbell's own excellent writing raises a standard of deafness.  Same with MLK Jr's.  It's so articulate and excellent
+that it leaves the common voice without equal.  And people attack.
+
+The Simpsons fall into this.  And can not escape the gravity popularity of social talent.  Banksy speaks of this, saying that
+if you saw him in a pub, you wouldn't listen.  John Lennon / Bagism / The Little Prince.
+
+Song writers who make beaufitul truth, inward to outward, next week are singing the reverse - outward to inward.
+Katy Perry pre-marriage vs. post-marriage being a perfect example.  Military video about standing up against her ex-husband
+(and have him keep the rings) adopting the Alexander the Great or Napolean psyche archetype of a male military hero
+her video practically looks like marketing for the USA Military! "Part of Me" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuwfgXD8qV8
+Which is almost a perfect archetype reversal of "Teenage Draem" self-sacrifice gift attitude: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98WtmW-lfeE
+
+She shows no self awareness in how she poisons True Love - not preaching CHOICE (His Freedom) and Forgiveness (Her Freedom). Ironically,
+by renoucing your freedom - you are realy free (Jesus on the Christ).  As Campbell says of films, these are making and breaking lives.
+
+The writing quality, and mistakes, does not speak truth.  And we poison the art - and demand art that poisons us.  it divides
+us by voices and perfection of delivery - great comedic timing, great song timing - and discard truth.  And when someone speaks
+truth of emotion - caring for strangers - or caring for the ideal of truth of the hart - we drive them into thinking they are insane.
+Iris Chang - can't openly admit she got carried away with emotion and her book is wrong - because the society does not value Truth
+and value ridicule of learning and sharing.  The high standard of a Campbell and MLK Jr poison the lower-talented individuals
+who speak the same truth.  The audience addiction ot high-quality mass-produced perfection.  HyperReality on a speaker, writer, idea
+scale -disallows the society to actually adopt the ideal it professes to care about os much.
+
+Nobody claims diviting of MLK Jr or Campbell - yet their ideas are as distant as the Earth is to the Moon - a high podium to audience.
+Leo B talks about htis, and devides rituaals of removing high fashion, being called crazy, and speaking loudly to offend the ears.
+Yet, he is unable to clean the polluted ocean of HyperRealty already in 1980 Sacramento culture - and now global on marriages
+and parenting.
+
+
+1. Iris Chang expresses her outrange in a book, truth of her emotion
+2. Book is factually imperfect, but the emotion of human warfare and even of similar racial conflicts - is deepr than say black/whtie (Africa/Europe) in North America (imported slaves, self-imported Europeans, and the even worse native that both supllanted)
+3. Society does not value her labor of ATTEMPTING to express the outrage - because her mind doesn't deal in pure facts like a robot
+  so discredts her. Instead of just listing the facts and saying HEY - this is the REAL ISSUE that EVERY PERSOn, All Humans, needs to focus
+  on and we need to deal with (MLK Jr).
+4. Pyshce inustry watches her fall in to Dante's age 35 - and misdiagnoses it - as they do not see her earier work as a path of self-learning
+   like Dante - as defined by Campbell
+5. Imperfection becomes the overriding vaue - not Compassion as Iris showed
+
+
+This Paradox of The Simpsons - trying to draw attention to the media itself, but also profiting.  It's the real UNSOLVED problem of today.
+Terroris, like the movie Seven (Edward Beranys prattioner in John Doe hidden behind the newspaper pulling psyche mask) - 
+and in Islamic terrorist (the rumors and news shwoing killing a the highest concern and value - never teaching it's opposite of
+Love, Compassion and Forgieness) - everything becomes a cesspool of highs and lows.  No Buddha middle path here,
+because you have turned Love into Romance and Religion into rules and fear.  That's what Campbell says bout the Reason of USA Pyramid
+one-side of argument. It is a society discussion when good marriage is only a 'business marriage' (like two tenants able to live
+a tolerabe life within a society landlord - just as the Troubadours identifeid in year 1210 - monster society).
+
+Malala is held up in similar fashion. And as Rick Roderick says - HyperReality an technoloy take over.
+We can not deal with the fact that the perfect (Campbell, MLK JR, Malala) reproduction does not serve us.
+That we, must, in democratic peer to peer fashion - rewrite the foundation we ALL stand on - instead of just
+point to a tiny few achievers who are dedicated specialists.  Specialization is not the problem, it's commonality.
+Leo says in 1980 "Don't forget Love" - what he is actually describing is: "Don't segregate Love" - just like the Rose Song
+say "And you think that love is only
+For the lucky and the strong"
+
+A society that segregates, disowns, drug use - prostitution - domestic violence - bad religion.  As if having a leader
+condem the bottom-tier (top condeming bottom) is how a society works.  As Stephan H says - a misunderstandinb built on a misundertanding.
+failed listening and intepretation, the non-Richard Feynman approach, fails us all.  We ae the LCD of our education system
+and the approach of short-sighted advertising poisons all the air and water we share.

+Self-control
+
+People tend to associate self-control with:
+
+1. Being quiet
+2. Not interrupting / disruptive behavior
+3. Gluteny, sexual desires, etc
+
+But they don't view it with:
+
+1. Listening when things are boring, difficult, or presented in ways inferior to the top talent
+2. Demonstrating understanding, being willing to be seen as wrong for the sake of mutual understanding.
+3. speak up "stick their neck out" beyond self-interest
+4. Being offended by 'truth' - of smells of humans, handicapped, retarded, illness, sickness
+5. Listening to music or film "outside preference"
+
+These risks for the community are discouraged.
+
+yet, most classic self-control doesn't present a risk to others - when these expanded views of self-control is all about protecting their own ego from others.
+
+Rick Roderick covered this:
+Foucault and the Disappearance of the Human
+
+"Well anyway, reversal seems to be a method of genealogy. Another is one connected to it and that’s marginality. You don’t just pay attention to what the leaders said – or the men said, or whoever the dominant group is – you look for the marginal discourses that do two things. They both make clear that there was a marginal discourse and they also show more clearly what the assumptions of the dominant history or discourse was. So marginality is another feature of what might be called a genealogy or archaeological method."
+
+"In other words, institutional communications function through rules that determine who may speak, about what they may speak, for how long they may speak, in what setting they may speak, and so on, and again, this is not an invidious thing, all societies had these. You may notice if you watched the congress that there are rules for how long people may speak; they are rules for who may speak. If you are a freshman member, its not advisable to hog a lot of the clock, this is not an advisable thing to do."
+
+"certain people didn’t get to talk in the history of Western Civilisation. They were excluded from the conversation. The deviant were excluded – and I am naming some now that have been studied by Foucault – deviants, criminals, the mad, and of course the more normal exclusions. Up until very recently women, the young, the old, the infirm, and so on; excluded in a certain way from this conversation, and I am not afraid to say along with Marx that we really don’t notice many working class or lower class people in the early great literature of the West."
+
+"The more powerfully the critic paints the ills of the society and the fragility of the self and the struggle it undergoes to be a human; the more powerful our account is, the more hopeless the people feel who could do anything about it. On the other hand, if we don’t paint the account in such a powerful way then people tend to underestimate what they are up against, so you have got a critic’s dilemma. Foucault clearly has picked the path where he doesn’t care if you feel powerless or not; that’s your problem, you have got to do something about it, so he draws out all the mechanisms of control to the maximum so that you understand them."
+
+"In any case, the great reformers of madness were the ones who wanted to, as it were, cure them created what Foucault calls a whole new disciplinary matrix around madness. What that means is that the curing of them did not liberate them, it did not give them the value they had at one time, no it set up a whole series of processes within which they could be observed, drugged, analysed, re-analysed, and of course I have joked about this process. I don’t want to use the strong word “madness” here but when we look at the expansion of this therapeutic zone on into the late 20th Century, we now find out that very few of us don’t belong in it."
+
+"So for Foucault this is not some great new humanistic advance in medicine that has liberalised the treatment of madness, it is a new form of control that’s based on a new language about the mad. For example we no longer call them morons and idiots; we call them the differently abled and so on. But for Foucault this new discourse is even more totalitarian because behind it hides the same mechanisms of power… not the same… but behind it hides mechanisms of power which keep these people in their sway."

-A small number of people influcing all the rest
-
-Instead of a constant peer to peer education.
-
-We claim that the Bible and Oriental religions are everyone, but the peer to peering constantly gets controled.
-
-Fear and Desire. As Joseph Campbell spent his lifetime cross-translating:
-
-"Getting back into that Garden is the aim of many a religion. When Yahweh threw man out of the Garden, he put two cherubim at the gate, with a flaming sword between. Now, when you approach a Buddhist shrine, with the Buddha seated under the tree of immortal life, you will find at the gate two guardians -- those are the cherubim, and you're going between them to the tree of immortal life. In the Christian tradition, Jesus on the cross is on a tree, the tree of immortal life, and he is the fruit of the tree. Jesus on the cross, the Buddha under the tree -- these are the same figures. And the cherubim at the gate -- who are they? At the Buddhist shrines you'll see one has his mouth open, the other has his mouth closed -- fear and desire, a pair of opposites. If you're approaching a garden like that, and those two figures there are real to you and threaten you, if you have fear for your life, you are still outside the garden. But if you are no longer attached to your ego existence, but see the ego existence as a function of a larger, eternal totality, and you favor the larger against the smaller, then you won't be afraid of those two figures, and you will go through."
-
-Again, repeating that until it is fully assimilated in your mind. Backwards and fowards.  This has been misunderstood by so many througout the history, don't underestimate how important it is to not get tangled and see the central point.
-
-Going past fear is exactly what the teaching is saying. 
-
-1. Advertising fear is to show happy people and to breed insecurity. In Western tradition, this is well known, how adam/eve became of ashamed of their individual sexuity and covered their self in clothing. To sell fashion, makeup, cosmetics, breast augmentation, fashion accessories, shoes, backpacks, etc - build on the same psycology known in the Adam/Eve story. Except instead of educating people on how to break the pattern, the anti-pattern, you constantly show the superiority of high expensive profit-making for the rich and wealthy owners of the Logos, Brnds, Trademarks, and so forth.  Seasons of the earth are similary adopted, and negative fear of being out of fashion is the desire otucome of the advertising. To be seen in 1970's clothing in 2015 only when approved by the pupiteers who better understand Adam/Eve psycology than the peer to peer individuals.  Turn the prisoners against each other in their minds, criticizing and looking away from the unkempt, outcasts.
-
-2. Drmatic acts of public execution, punishment, and televists shootouts and arrests. Do you ever hear the Television News say that the problem is that love and compassion fail us? Is compassion a word you hear every night, nothing it's absence! No, you hear thta law, order, control systems, anti peer to peer. To again breed insecurity, domination, power strutures, top-down perspective inside the mind. To repeat this like poetry night after night.  The very people speaking he news make more money and more personal power (fame, influence) through doing a better job of enslaving the listener.  The content of the story is constantly measured for higher ratings, acceptance, feeding the ego. Go back again to the Campbell quote, ego is a key thinking of Religion education, to not be ego-controlled by the mind. Yet, when you do not see this education and teaching systm applied on the evening news - your religion teachers have failed you. As they too use factory teaching techniques, convicing you of the ego interpretation anti peer to peer view of religion.  Holy leaders and their special hats are militry uniforms.  The television anchor desk and interview chair are the power pulpits.
-
-As the Funding Fathers of the United States also declared with their "Eye of Reason" - there is no substitute for authentic peer to peer.
-
-Is it incredibly difficult and hard! YES!!! But we have more electronic printing presses, teaching tools, and libraries and human beings in all of world history.
-At some point, when do we focus on learning authentic peer to peer, as was the very ORIGINS of our famous religious teachers ( prophets ).
-All along this message has been here, and we are living in the wasteland of avoiding it as 'too difficult'.
-
-For me, what I find difficult is the way we live now!  So much conformity and puppet strings. Behaving like a robot seems incredibly difficult to me, as computing logic has zero compassion, forgiveness and love.
-
-These problems can not possibly be overstated. They are so ingranted as positives, as tradable goods, that the misunderstanding so established and accepted.  Simple robotic behavior, organized and structured, is easier to the mind. THis was known, and we have weaponized it.  We have let braodcast, mass printing, etc be used to weaponize it. And tools like Social Media people are doing it peer to peer, speaking non-truth of only what the Ego wishes people to see - the fashion consumption, the conformity, the non-mistakes - and rush to the legal system, delete button, and unfriend button when real truth of total humanity comes out!  This is EXACTLY what Campbell is saying!  Re-read the quote!  To underestimate this understanding and viewpoint is to fail to see how successfull easy answers of conformity have been througout history!
-
-Yet, time and time again, a small number of individuals re-discover the original meaning. We can dust off the old books in our library and find individuals like Dante, who see WHY these stories had to be so commplicated. Because that's the truth of our brains,
-of a real peer to peer world, the Garden IS COMPLICATED!  And to be outside the garden, to use terror, fear, insecurity and conformity is quicker and easier to teach in factory fashion.
-
-how can we consider ourselves educated, and happy, when we know what is going on with the total earth? To just associate with an in-group. Adam/Eve, for example, aren't in group and out, we are all the same
-but this difficult idea/metaphor is the one we keep discounting.  Instead, we prefer to fight national boundries, geographic boundries, skin colors, economic lines, etc
-
-It isn't capetlissm, communish, socialism - it's Love Compassion and Forgiveness that our our most powerful human tools!  yet, we fight against these tools
-when they have Eternal abudance in their very education roots. They are metaphors for things that literally make us all happier
-and we fight here over crumbs that only leave us starving.
-
-This is the central words of MLK JR:
-
-"There are certain things in our nation and in the world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will will be maladjusted until the good societies realize — I say very honestly that I never intend to become adjusted to — segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence."
-
-Here, he is saying, we must peer to peer first and foremost, not be adjusted until we are All People Equal. If a person mistakes, terror or fear surfaces, one is robbed or mudered, we let
-forgiveness and compassion heal it - not falling into the trap of the cycle of a small number controlling the large.
-
-It may seem mindless slaves to Love, but it isn't. It's a higher education that only history books show. Animals don't have our educaiton system
-of books, of telescopes and microscopes. it's only possible with our more DEVELOPED view to create and author Compassion and Love.
-What's broken is our factory approach to education. The Prophets of all the Earth, did not use Factory education. It is out of deep personal
-listening that they realize that the brain itself is acting out a internal bi-poloar behavior, that what we hear and see is not properly
-understood.  An in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, this has been spelled out to us for a very long time.  And as Campell is sayig, this is
-the very meaning of the gurdians of the gates of Eden.
-
--------------
-
-The Police, Miltary, and the Psycologist are all trying to heal the personal denial of the individuals.  This is a failed structure.
-War can not be organized, orhistrated, educated.  No, educaiton needs to be beyond animal murder and killing sport.
-Hunting for sport, military conflict, or killing for defense - military conflict - is just a sophisticated technological application of animal behavior.
-Animals do not create poetry, moon landings, and Mythology. Love and Compassion are the technlogy of humanity, not ICBM's and Nuclear Winter.
-To ignore the impact we have on each other, peer to peer, negatively - how terrorist can enslave us with fear and anxiety - is to also ignore
-how advertising and marketing can mesmerize (enslave) with promises of being #1 in your class. To purchase the right airplane to stand next to
-to and to wear the right brand-name fashion.  To try to dress as a Peacock to be seen.  This applied physiology against other humans
-is weaponized psycology.  It's military, not to serve the greater good, but to serve conquest and manipulation.
-
-A greater Good is Everyone, all the Earth. All the Universe!  That's always been the teaching of religion, those pesky difficult painful pages
-and people who say war is painful, death of their son is painful, do not see that Peace and ending War seems to be a greater pain!
-
-So Psycologist try to treat returning soldiers, but the real pain is in all of our denial that there should be no war at all. And psycologist
-won't admit that Truth to their wounded soldiers.
-
-And we rip those good pages out of our Mythology stories. The ones educating forgiveness, compassion as our strongest non-animal tools born
-of years of hard learning, experience, travel, pondering, meditation - talking communicating.
-
-I will kill your son in Uniform A because you killed my son and I wear Uniform B.  And even if the uniforms are removed, the terrorist shows
-they can blend in, in animal gurilla tactics, using th same mental logic. And we hold them as heroes on one side of a war, David vs. Gollieth.
-This is not education.  This is weaponized minds turned toward the ego.
-
-The real education can not be taught in factory classrooms like military boot camp.  Rice farmers educated to be murders with uniforms and teachers.
-Corn farmers educated to be murderes by unfiforms and teachers.  Terror is easier to teach, less painful, and quicker than Forgiveness and Compassion for All.
-The promise of heaven has been to focus on a few, on "our side". The ego aspect of thinking, of I vs. others.  The applied popularity of Team Sports.
-
-it's easy to teach military because the animals are already showing us survival. We are already killing living plants and animals to eat.
-We are given this education as soon as we ae weened off the breast, of a mother who is killing plants and animals.  To deny this truth is to
-deny that we already know to kill and eat. That the teeth and the mind are telling us the facts.  That war feeds from all over the globe
-and informing our minds that marriage fighting and war fighting are both bad.
-
-Yet, we accept them. Somehow we find a way to keep saying: It's more painful to use Forgiveness and Compassion for All - so let us segregate
-and take teams - and threaten each other!  To use terror and fear as our controlling collective power.  To all live under fear of map lines, passports
-clothing, etc.  And advertising and marketing constantly reminds us of who is above us, the owners who paid for those advertisements. And our aritsts
-can't wait to be famous and rich.
-
-"The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little."
-
-he does not hape people, he hates a system that promotes conquest, war, and factory education.  Anti peer to peer, anti individual, and anti Compassion and Forgiveness.

-Metaphor for the Fundamental Teaching Problem of Religion
-
-If you view God as the Moon in the sky (not to take this literally please, but only for sake of education)... there are two ways to divide religion teaching
-
-1. Everyone stares at the moon and behaves as the moon directs in a nearly robot-like fashion. And the moon itself directs everyone and is a type of leader.
-
-2. Every learns of the moon, like a vocabulary or langage, like a song and a education. Then is to stare at each other, person to person, peer to peer.  Conflicts are to be resolved by using the vocabulary of the m
-oon, the perspective of thinking and observation from the moon, to work together in undertanding and overcoming conflicts.
-
-Now a robot is itself an interesting idea. A computerized logic and behavior. At the time of the older religions, no such thing existed. However, the moon and stars and suns, moved in the same predictable fashion as a robot.
-
-The problem becomes one of teaching style. Self-learning of the religion favors peer to peer perspective. Classroom, teacher-oriented instruction favors a more robotic and forced student.

-
-Now as I must try to build a new life, each and Love must be held as the central reason. It was why I was enduring such pain, and to misunderstad is to mistake suicide for depth.
-I sacrificed my ego, every form of selfishness I had, and at times they became overwhelming kicks in the ass.

-One thing I started to focus on the past decade, age 35 onward, was the film writers and directors I connected with most deeply. the films I watched

-so much better to me - what I identify as the same longing, connection, or realization, dream, etc.  Then I would look at their personal

-the poison marriage ocean of the society. Here they had money, they had often children, they had this beautiful artistic tallent that would connect
-with millions of serious listeners in the audience. But how did that non-autistic and expressive nature serve them in their life? The same
-conflicts.
-I observe much of the same pattern with poets, songwriters, etc that I would connect with.  Even if they were such better socila people
-not autistic in any way - they would fail to connect with one, and often, multiple marriage partners.  It was these strong observations
-of such socially talented people, who had no mental disorder of autism or such, that I would start to question the causes.
-And religious teachers would say money was always a factor. I started to quesiton that the society itself, the tragedy of the commons,

-	<h1>Divided By Zero</h1>
-	By Stephen Alfred Gutknecht.<div>Rev 00051</div>
-	<p>New York Professor Joseph Campbell is a primary source for this document.
-	Proper references to source material are attempted. Please contact if not correct.
-	I declare this document to be <em>Public Domain</em>, free to share, on all the Universe.
-	Donations to support my material life are always welcome, to me personally, and I also suggest the JCF.</p>
-	<p>The title <em>Divided By Zero</em> is a reference to mathmatics. In rational math, it is not possible to divide one or two by zero.
-	"Divide by Zero" is also an <i>exception</i> encountered frequently in computing when a software programmer mistakenly initilizes a variable.
-	Overall, the theme that God can not be divided by man, and that all fiction and non-fiction art (expressions) converge to be indivisible.
-	Science, Religion, Fiction, Non-Fiction and Art - they are all indivisible.  It is only the educations and viewpoints of the human brain that create these artificial divisions.
-	As Campbell fully explains, this is also the <em>Eye of Reason</em> that the Founding Fathers of the United States of America intended to be used in modern democracy.  It is also the Sufi view of Islam.
-	</p>
-
-	<p>The quotes are essential to me. As in my lifetime, I feel deeply that we have ignored the best of human experience - discarding it due to outer wrapping. Further, we have mostly accepted the worst of new learning techniques, only due to the fast immediate payoff (Edward Bernays teachings). The quotes are important to shared context, as it must be seen how little attention has been given to these public broadcasts that have collected dust - and how they interconnect. Most of all, I am always in a state of sadness, seeing the symbol of the Founding Fathers Eye of Reason in tears, as our Symbolic Eagle was created pointing at the Olive Branch. During my life, we have had homeland peacetime - but we have ignored these deeper educators - wasting our peace in building for the next wartime.  When do we really choose to confront our society ego issues and listen to our Troubadour artists?  The songs and other art do not provide escape for me, they provide reminders of the Olive Branch that we seem to have forgotten.</p>

-		<li>James Joyce; ~1917, fiction Stephen's conversation in Ulysses: <span class="quoteA">&quot;History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake&quot;</span></li>
-		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM, on the USA $1 Bill Pyramid: <span class="quoteA">&quot;If you look behind that pyramid, you see a desert.
-		   If you look before it, you see plants growing. The desert, the tumult in Europe, wars and wars and wars
-		    -- we have pulled ourselves out of it and created a state in the name of <em>Reason</em>, <span class="quoteH0">not in the name of power</span>, and out of that will come the flowerings of the new life. That's the sense of that part of the pyramid.&quot;</span></li>
-		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM: <span class="quoteA">&quot;<span class="quoteH0">this is the ground of what the [future] myth is to be</span>. It's already here: the <em>Eye of Reason</em>, not of my nationality; the Eye of Reason, not of my religious community; the Eye of Reason, not of my linguistic community. Do you see?
-			And this would be the <span class="quoteH0">philosophy for the planet</span>, not for this group, that group, or the other group. 
-			When you see the earth from the moon, you don't see any divisions there of nations or states. This might be the symbol, really, for the new mythology to come. That is the country that we are going to be celebrating. And those are the people that we are one with.&quot;</span></li>
-		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM: <span class="quoteA">&quot;The shaman is the person, male or female, who in his late childhood or early youth has an overwhelming psychological experience that turns him totally inward.
-			It's a kind of schizophrenic crack-up. The whole unconscious opens up, and the shaman falls into it.
-			This shaman experience has been described many, many times. It occurs all the way from Siberia right through the Americas down to Tierra del Fuego.&quot;</li>
-		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM: <span class="quoteA">&quot;I have attended a number of <span class="quoteH0">psychological conferences</span> dealing with this whole problem of the difference between the <span class="quoteH0">mystical experience and the psychological crack-up</span>. The difference is that the one who cracks up is drowning in the water in which the mystic swims. You have to be prepared for this experience.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>Campbell; March 4, 1970; Cooper Union; [topic:  Dr. John Perry of San Francisco]
-			<span class="quoteA">&quot;Then Dr. Perry sent me a copy of a paper that he had written on schizophrenia that had been <span class="quoteH0">published in 1963 in the <i>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</i></span>.
-			And to my great amazement I found that the imagery of the schizophrenic paralleled almost point for point the themes that I had rendered in
-			<span class="quoteH0"><i>The Hero With a Thousand Faces</i>, back in 1949</span>, which was based simply on a comparative study of mythology.
-			It had nothing to do with psychoanalysis, or psychology, but it was simply a synthesis of the materials and imageries of the mythological traditions of mankind, delineating the main constant motifs that did appear in all.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now, eternity is beyond all categories of thought. This is an important point in all of the great Oriental religions. We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can't be told because they transcend thought. 
-			The <span class="quoteH0">second best are misunderstood</span>, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can't be thought about. The <span class="quoteH0">third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field</span> of reference to what is absolutely transcendent.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>Campbell; 1974 audio lecture: <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now I was reading shortly before coming here a work by Abraham Maslow, a wonderful psychologist, a very important psychologist, one whom I most delight in reading. And he was speaking of what he called a “hierarchy of values for which people live,” and the hierarchy was as follows: survival, security, personal relationships, and self-development.
-			Fortunately I was reading those only a day or so ago, and then I began thinking of this lecture today, and I went back to those and I thought, <span class="quoteH0">Well those are exactly the values that have nothing to do with mythology</span>.
-			Mythology is the law of giving yourself, losing yourself.
-			A person who lives by a myth is fascinated by an aspiration for which he will sacrifice security, for which he will sacrifice even his life, for which he will sacrifice friends and everything else.&quot;</span>

-This is when I go and say: because I am born a Jew or baptized a Christian - I accept the law of Moses.
-And I will abrogat my role as a choice maker because the choice has been made for me by Moses, by the theologians, by the preachers - whoever the case may be.
-So, here I consciously abrogate my power of choice.
-And that is what the old Gnostics called the psychic level.
-And thirdly, of course, there is the individual who raises above these.
-And who becomes the conscious choice maker.
-But Lest you think this kind of person has a Wonderful time all the time... let me assure you that it's a very difficult path, of course.

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;This is the final secret of myth -- to teach you how to penetrate the labyrinth of life in such a way that its spiritual values come through.
-			That is the <span class="quoteH0">problem of Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em></span>, too. The crisis comes in the "middle of the way of our life," when the body is beginning to fade, and another whole constellation of themes comes breaking into your dream world. Dante says that, in the middle year of his life, he was lost in a dangerous wood.
-			And he was threatened there by three animals, symbolizing pride, desire, and fear. Then Virgil, the personification of poetic insight, appeared and conducted him through the labyrinth of hell, which is the place of those fixed to their desires and fears, who can't pass through to eternity.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>
-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The <span class="quoteH0">function of art is to reveal</span> this radiance through the created object. When you see the beautiful organization of a fortunately composed work of art, you just say, "Aha!" Somehow it speaks to the order in your own life and leads to the realization of the very things that religions are concerned to render.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; November 16, 1961; <span class="quoteA">&quot;I would say that in most recent times, the <span class="quoteH0">strongest statement of the principle of the individual</span> is that of Nietzsche philosophy and the idea of the Superman [Übermensch].
-			<span class="quoteH0">This has been a greatly misrepresented point of view</span>. There has been a general tendency to confuse Nietzsche’s view of the Superman with his view of the Masterman—they are not the same.
-			<br />
-			Nietzsche speaks of the naive man-animal, powerful in his life, who lacks however, the sense of the spirit. And then there is the principle of what he calls the man of the decadence, who is questioning man’s problems and so forth—the intellectual, the Socratic man who is, as he says, a sick man: the Masterman and the man of the decadence.
-			<br />
-			The <span class="quoteH0">Superman [Übermensch] is the one who embraces both principals</span>, who both has the courage to live, and has the wit to question life—to query it. Thomas Mann in all of his writings used this as his ideal. The ideal of the man with the intellect and the words that kill, that name life, that know all its faults, and yet has the courage and sympathy to love life in its faults, and with its faults, and because of its faults.
-			Nietzsche’s idea of the Superman is beautifully <span class="quoteH0">summarized in Mann’s writings when he speaks of the plastic irony [erotic irony] of the writer’s craft</span>.&quot;<span>
-		</li>
-		<li>
-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Our life evokes our character. <span class="quoteH0">You find out more about yourself as you go on</span>. That's why it's good to be able to put yourself in situations that will evoke your higher nature rather than your lower. "Lead us not into temptation." 
-			Ortega y Gasset talks about the environment and the hero in his Meditations on Don Quixote. Don Quixote was the last hero of the Middle Ages. He rode out to encounter giants, but instead of giants, his environment produced windmills. Ortega points out that this story takes place about the time that a mechanistic interpretation of the world came in, so that the environment was no longer spiritually responsive to the hero. The hero is today running up against a hard world that is in no way responsive to his spiritual need. 
-			[...] Quixote saved the adventure for himself by inventing a magician who had just transformed the giants he had gone forth to encounter into windmills. You can do that, too, if you have a poetic imagination. Earlier, though, it was not a mechanistic world in which the hero moved but a world alive and responsive to his spiritual readiness. Now <span class="quoteH0">it has become to such an extent a sheerly mechanistic world, as interpreted through our physical sciences, Marxist sociology, and behavioristic psychology</span>, that we're nothing but a predictable pattern of wires responding to stimuli.
-			This nineteenth-century interpretation has squeezed the freedom of the human will out of modern life.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>
-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;the structure and something of the spiritual sense of this adventure can be seen already anticipated in the puberty or initiation rituals of early tribal societies, through which a child is compelled to give up its childhood and become an adult -- to die, you might say, to its infantile personality and psyche and come back as a responsible adult. This is a fundamental psychological transformation that everyone has to undergo.
-			We are in childhood in a condition of dependency under someone's protection and supervision for some fourteen to twenty-one years -- and <span class="quoteH0">if you're going on for your Ph.D., this may continue to perhaps thirty-five. You are in no way a self-responsible, free agent, but an obedient dependent, expecting and receiving punishments and rewards</span>. To evolve out of this position of psychological immaturity to the courage of self-responsibility and assurance requires a death and a resurrection. That's the basic motif of the universal hero's journey -- leaving one condition and finding the source of life to bring you forth into a richer or mature condition.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; March 1, 1967 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now, most societies are extremely dogmatic and fierce in their integration of the individual. The individual is born as a separate entity. He is carved up, so to say, and made to fit into a pattern that the society requires. It doesn't require a total man; <span class="quoteH0">it requires a part man — not an individual, but a dividuum: someone who has been divided up</span> and put into a notch.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and <span class="quoteH0">a myth is the society's dream. The myth is the public dream</span> and the dream is the private myth. If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group.

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;I don't know where else they come from. They come from the imagination, don't they? The imagination is grounded in the energy of the organs of the body, and these are the same in all human beings. Since imagination comes out of one biological ground, it is bound to produce certain themes. Dreams are dreams. There are certain characteristics of dreams that can be enumerated, no matter who is dreaming them.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now there is another, deeper meaning of dreamtime -- which is of a time that is no time, just an enduring state of being.
-			There is an important myth from Indonesia that tells of this mythological age and its termination. <span class="quoteH0">In the beginning, according to this story, the ancestors were not distinguished as to sex</span>. There were no births, there were no deaths. Then a great public dance was celebrated, and in the course of the dance one of the participants was trampled to death and torn to pieces, and the pieces were buried. At the moment of that killing the sexes became separated, so that death was now balanced by begetting, begetting by death, while from the buried parts of the dismembered body food plants grew. Time had come into being, death, birth, and <span class="quoteH0">the killing and eating of other living beings, for the preservation of life</span>. The timeless time of the beginning had been terminated by a communal crime, a deliberate murder or sacrifice.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The ultimate word in our English language for that which is transcendent is God. But then you have a concept, don't you see? You think of God as the father. Now, in religions where the god or creator is the mother, the whole world is her body. There is nowhere else. The male god is usually somewhere else.
-			<span class="quoteH0">But male and female are two aspects of one principle. The division of life into sexes was a late division. Biologically, the amoeba isn't male and female</span>. The early cells are just cells. They divide and become two by asexual reproduction. I don't know at what levels sexuality comes in, but it's late. That's why it's absurd to speak of God as of either this sex or that sex. The divine power is antecedent to sexual separation.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;The difference between the Jungian archetypes of the unconscious and Freud's complexes is that the archetypes of the unconscious are manifestations of the organs of the body and their powers.
-			Archetypes are biologically grounded, whereas the Freudian unconscious is a collection of repressed traumatic experiences from the individual's lifetime. The Freudian unconscious is a personal unconscious, it is biographical. <span class="quoteH0">The Jungian archetypes of the unconscious are biological</span>.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;I think of mythology as the homeland of the muses, the inspirers of art, the inspirers of poetry. To <span class="quoteH0">see life as a poem and yourself participating in a poem</span> is what the myth does for you.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>
-			Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;That would be a mistake in the reading of the symbol. That is reading the words in terms of prose instead of in terms of poetry, <span class="quoteH0">reading the metaphor in terms of the denotation instead of the connotation</span>. 
-			[...]
-			That which is beyond even the concept of reality, that which transcends all thought. The myth puts you there all the time, gives you a line to connect with that mystery which you are. 
-			Shakespeare said that <span class="quoteH0">art is a mirror held up to nature. And that's what it is. The nature is your nature, and all of these wonderful poetic images of mythology are referring to something in you</span>.

-			Campbell; November 3, 1967 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;When you realize that life was present on this planet for literally millions and hundreds of millions of years before consciousness emerged, and the eye and mind beheld what is here, and when you think of an infant before its <span class="quoteH0">consciousness comes to flower already doing the major job of its life—namely producing a body out of a couple of little cells, bringing forth this miracle, with all of the organs already functioning, none of these organs having asked consciousness what it was functioning for</span>, it being the job of consciousness rather to find out what the body is all about you realize that there's rather a split here between the monstrous thing that life is. Just consider its basic character: it consists of living by eating other lives. Its main character is monstrous. And when consciousness becomes aware of this, there is this sense of terrific awe and horror, but also fascination and recognition, because that is what we are.&quot;</span>

-			Campbell; November 3, 1967 Audio lecture; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now the mythologies in general take two attitudes toward this. One is that of affirmation; that is to say, reconciling consciousness to the nature of existence. And the other attitude I call the great reversal, which is that of turning all the positives into negatives and rejecting it, saying, “This is something that should not have been; better pull out.”
-
-			Remember Schopenhauer's statement: “Life is something that should not have been.” The Buddha's saying: “All life is a fire.” There is the fire of passion, fire of fear, fire of this, that and the other aspect of life—quench that fire. Nirvana is the quenching of the fire.

Simply because we had a religious formula for everything psychic — and one that is far more beautiful and comprehensive than immediate experience. Though the Christian view of the world has paled for many people, the symbolic treasure-rooms of the East are still full of marvels that can nourish for a long time to come the passion for show and new clothes. What is more, these images — be they Christian or Buddhist or what you will — are lovely, mysterious, richly intuitive.&quot;</span>

To describe experience, you become an artist. The old distinction between artists and scientists must vanish. Every time we teach a child correct usage of an external symbol, we must spend as much time teaching him how to fission and reassemble external grammar to communicate the internal. The training of artists and creative performers can be a straightforward, almost mechanical process. When you teach someone how to perform creatively (ie, associate dead symbols in new combinations), you expand his potential for experiencing more widely and richly.&quot;</span>

This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their mystical teachings. … The esoteric meaning, as it has been interpreted in this manual, <span class="quoteH0">is that it is death and rebirth of the ego that is described</span>, not of the body. Lama Govinda indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The book's esoteric <span class="quoteH0">meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism</span>. It was not intended for general reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the pre-mortem-death-rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm.&quot;</span>

You may occasionally dress yourself up as one of them, watch the same mindless television shows as they do, maybe even eat the same fast food sometimes. But it seems that the more you try to fit in, the more you feel like an outsider, watching the “normal people” as they go about their automatic existences. For every time you say club passwords like “Have a nice day” and “Weather’s awful today, eh?”, you yearn inside to say forbidden things like “Tell me something that makes you cry” or “What do you think deja vu is for?”. Face it, you even want to talk to that girl in the elevator. But what if that girl in the elevator (and the balding man who walks past your cubicle at work) are thinking the same thing?

-			Although the work may be fiction, the idea expressed to me expmlifies both the War on Terror and the War on Drugs that is dmoestic and external in my lifetime. ""The war, therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that the hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word "war," therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that is exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and has been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war." -George Orwell, 1984

-		<li>Campbell; 1974 Audio: <span class="quoteA">&quot;Now the problem that all of the great masters give us is that of finding the inward way and holding to the outer way. This is a formula that the old Sufis worked out in the following way: <span class="quoteH0">they spoke of wearing the outer garment of the law—that is to say, the order of society in which one is living—and wearing the inner garment of the mythic way</span>.
-			Now in order to find the inner garment you have to take off the outer garment and let it go. There is a long season very often of inward turning this way, and throwing the world away.
-			But unless you can put the other garment back on again, you haven’t really come to the sophistication that lets you know that this is that, and that is this—that this outer garment is the outer reflection of the same laws and principles that you’re finding within, so that you should be at ease somehow in the two worlds. This is an old mythological story.&quot;</span>

-		<li>Campbell; 1986 PoM; <span class="quoteA">&quot;Well, people do experience it. Those in the Middle Ages who experienced it were usually burned as heretics. <span class="quoteH0">One of the great heresies in the West is the heresy that Christ pronounced when he said, "I and the Father are one." He was crucified for saying that. In the Middle Ages, nine hundred years after Christ, a great Sufi mystic said, "I and my beloved are one," and he, too, was crucified</span>. As he was going to the cross, he prayed, "O my Lord, if you had taught these people what you have taught me, they would not be doing this to me. And if you had not taught me, this would not be happening to me. Blessed is the Lord and all his works." Another of the Sufi mystics said, "The function of the orthodox [strict] community is to give the mystic his desire, which is a union with God, through mortification and death."&quot;</span>

-		<li>Richard Feynman on Education Book-reading vs. Experience; <a href="http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education">Travels to Brazil sponsored by the USA State Department</a>; please read entire content, multiple times.
-		 Excerpt: <span class="quoteA">&quot;I discovered a very strange phenomenon: I could ask a question, which the students would answer immediately. <span class="quoteH0">But the next time I would ask the question – the same subject, and the same question, as far as I could tell – they couldn’t answer it at all!</span>&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>Richard Feynman on Education Book-reading vs. Experience; <a href="http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education">Travels to Brazil sponsored by the USA State Department</a>; please read entire content, multiple times.
-		 Excerpt: <span class="quoteA">&quot;I didn’t expect that. I knew the system was bad, but 100 percent – it was terrible!
-			Since I had gone to Brazil <span class="quoteH0">under a program sponsored by the United States Government</span>, I was asked by the State Department to write a report about my experiences in Brazil, so I wrote out the essentials of the speech I had just given. I found out later through the grapevine that the reaction of somebody in the State Department was, “That shows you how dangerous it is to send somebody to Brazil who is so naive.
-			Foolish fellow; he can only cause trouble. He didn’t understand the problems.” <span class="quoteH0">Quite the contrary!</span> I think this person in the State Department was naive to think that because he saw a university with a list of courses and descriptions, that’s what it was.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>Richard Stallman; (date not researched); <span class="quoteA">&quot;While corporations dominate society and write the laws, each advance in technology is an opening for them to further restrict its users.&quot;</span></li>
-		<li>Richard Stallman; (date not researched); <span class="quoteA">&quot;I don't have a problem with someone using their talents to become successful, <span class="quoteH0">I just don't think the highest calling is success</span>. Things like freedom and the expansion of knowledge are beyond success, beyond the personal. Personal success is not wrong, but it is limited in importance, and once you have enough of it it is a shame to keep striving for that, instead of for truth, beauty, or justice.&quot;</span></li>
-		<li>
-			Richard Stallman; “Free Software in Ethics and Practice” talk at CMC MSU, Moscow, Russia, (3 March 2008); <span class="quoteA">&quot;Isn't it ironic that the proprietary software developers call us communists? We are the ones who have provided for a free market, where they allow only monopoly. … if the users chooses this proprietary software package, he then falls into this monopoly for support … the only way to escape from monopoly is to escape from proprietary [computer] software, and <span class="quoteH0">that is what the free software movement is all about</span>.&quot;</span>
-		</li>
-		<li>Richard Feynman; Rogers Commission Report; Appendix  F - Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle (9 June 1986);  <span class="quoteA">&quot;Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA officials deal in a world of reality in understanding technological weaknesses and imperfections well enough to be actively trying to eliminate them. They must live in reality in comparing the costs and utility of the [Space] Shuttle to other methods of entering space. And they must be realistic in making contracts, in estimating costs, and the difficulty of the projects. Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed, schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way the government would not support them, then so be it. NASA owes it to the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for the use of their limited resources.
-			<span class="quoteH0">For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled</span>.&quot;</span></li>
-		<li>Richard Feynman; The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist; The Uncertainty of Science (1963); <span class="quoteA">&quot;It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe, beyond man, to contemplate the universe without man, as it was in a great part of its long history and as it is in a great majority of places. When this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty are fully appreciated to then turn the objective eye back on man viewed as matter, to see life as part of this universal mystery of greatest depth, is to sense an experience which is very rare and very exciting. It usually ends in laughter and a delight in the futility of trying to understand what this atom in the universe is, this thing—atoms with curiosity—that looks at itself and wonders why it wonders. Well, these scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but <span class="quoteH0">they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it was all arranged as a stage for God to watch man's struggle for good and evil seems inadequate.</span>.&quot;</span>

-<h2>Intention of this Document</h2>
-
-	<p>I, Stephen Alfred Gutknecht, am speaking for myself to defend certain methods of thought, "Eye of Reason" and it's general painful difficulty.  To live in a society where things are divided.</p>
-
-	<p>BE WARNED: This section is a <span class="quoteH0">mess of brainstorm and emotions</span>, not all kind and nice. It needs massive editing, rework, etc. I'm trying to find the center of my topics, it is still very early in this writing.</p>
-
-	general concerns:
-
-	<ol>
-		<li>Compassion for strangers all over the world, what we see on TV and in print, and internalizing it</li>
-		<li>War and fighting over Religon books and conflicting education techniques.  Such as the Nazi attempt to exterminate all the Jewish in World War II.
-		 And the Shia vs. Sunni fighting going on today in Islam/Muslim communities.</li>
-                <li>The merits of art, fiction, and Sufi Islam viewpoints in modern religion</li>
-		<li>The new voice of  ملاله یوسفزۍ  not given the proper attention. Not recognized as the same ideals of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</li>
-		<li>Marriage ideals with total freedom have become a cesspoll in a private toilet, with no proper education about the pain of Ego sharing. How husband+wife AMOR Love can be stronger than parent+child or peer friendships.  Leo B. and Troubadours</li>
-		<li>The poison impact of Edward Bernays techniques on education  our societies. From cradle to grave, this teaching system is negatively impacting interpersonal relationships and lifestyles.</li>
-		<li>Easter Sunday 1929 and Edward Bernays - and the resulting year 2015 cancer, obeseity, family communications problems (team factions of fast food and consumptive living), and division of wealthy and poor in the USA and now globally. Removing <i>Eye of Reason</i> as the principal of peer to peer Democracy and Education.</li>
-		<li>Teaching techniques focused on sterile classrooms - and the cultural attacks against the 1960's Peace Movemeents and Love + Compasssion + Music (excessive anti-society copyright and patents) and how these teaching techniques impact the students, such as Richard Feynman said about Brazil Physics students</li>
-		<li>The horrible teaching of our modern Church/Temple/Mosques to fight (and disagree) against each other.  Even internal factions such as Protestant vs. Catholic / Sunni vs. Shia - ignoring  جلال‌الدین محمد رومی, James Joyce and Joseph Campbell's (and many other individuals) unified theories.
-		Further, the latest modern use of the word "Love" as a consumable by McDonald's, Suabaru, Starbucks, etc. (hundreds of examples on youtube, etc). Such low views of "Love" and "Religion" remove important concepts of Eternity, Forgiveness, etc.</li>
-		<li>Public infrastructure of the world, in a GPL fashion like Richard Stallman. Democratic election machines, democratic passports, democratic tax systems, etc.</li>
-		<li>The failure of modern Pysche medical science to account for the work of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung - and to take a Freud Socratic Path.  Systemic insulting Hippies and religions Peace people (Martin Luther King Jr, Leo F. Buscaglia) as "crazy" and "extremeist".
-			Leo F. Buscaglia specifically spoke in Sacramento, California PBS 1980 about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opGlp1pE59s">being called "crazy"</a> during my childhood.</li>
-		<li>The metaphors of a Society Mythology (religion) as a Computer Operating System (protected mode) and seams where violence and hate appear and how such negatives can be improved / reduced</li>
-		<li>Society (Socratic science) failure to recognize that Autism existed before the 1950's and how it is treated differenty by each culture on the Earth. Further, the obsession over children and not considering the adults with Autism.</li>
-		<li>How World News is not free to All people on an Internet Wikipedia type system - and instead has become Edward Bernays propeganda and contantly uses fear and terror of car accidents, shootouts, other nations, etc.  How this poisons both Founding Father's Eye of Reason and all global Democratic ideals.  The focus on profits and large corporate ownership of news ("the press") has made everyday conversations full of greed-driven misinforation and terrorists controlling the majority.</li>
-		<li>How youth no longer backpack and travel as part of their education, instead sit behind computer desks and stare into their iPhone - and are angry and hateful toward the world - and how things like Global Climate Change are ignored while the comparatively established sit in air conditioned comfort - lacking compassion even close to home - such as the "War on Drugs" against Mexico (society "Love thy Neighbor", "Eye of Reason" education).</li>
-		<li>How almost all our artists are profit-seeking fame-seeking sellouts making deals with massive profit corporate music sellers like Apple Computers. Even Michael Jackson, as criticized by Tom Waits. The Regean "War on Drugs" was a modern day Prohibition against Hippies.  I never even used these drugs, but I see the murder and violence this created by declaring "War" on people's learning of their own minds through often peaceful drugs, art, music, etc.  That Detroit and New Orleans, America's music roots of Jazz and Motown - are in such ruins in year 2015 shows the war is right at home.
-		Austin art has expanded in many directions of artists who only travel if paid to do so and for Facebook Likes and publicity photos (why is Austin not one  of the first places to legalize Pot?) - not like Detroit or New Orleans used to be before "Drug Wars" and person-to-person backpacking travel were systemtically de-emphasized by educators. <i>Keep Austin Wierd</i> got mostly paved over, and Public Transit ignored in favor of iPhone bubbles on wheels. Edward Bernays seems to be our educator of youth today, given the high-value cars in the parking lots I see at the year 2015 university - and fashion backpacks.</li>
-		<li>The failure of the United States of America to establish an electronic peer to peer payment/currency system to facilitate small business and artists directly. Eye of Reason, peer to peer, failure in service to monolitic coporations, corrupt politicians, and corrupt lawyers.</li>
-	</ol>
-
-Why is it in year 2015 we consider ourselves so educated when we keep overlooking all these things our artists are saying? We dance to songs, but do not listen to their lyrics. Too many of us are blind in the *Eye of Reason*, being MasterMan and not being a total human.
-
-<h2>Reference Art - Music Songs</h2>
-
-To me, personally inward, it is important to pay attention to the decades these artists have been ignored. The years the songs were published and entered into the society "Public Dream" (Carl Jung terminology). The poems are complex and fit with Campbell's definition of Sublime art (in his review of art in <em>The Inner Reaches of Outer Space</em>).  They are not movtivated by money as much as the more popular, and speak Troubadour Year 1210 Truth against society corruption:

-<h2>Chapter 1: Oceans</h2>
-
-As I stood on the beach in Bali Indonesia on New Years Eve, after exiting the beautiful modern shopping mall - having just then seen the terrible New Hobbit movie - I saw thousands and thousands of people preparing for an evening of individual rocket launches.
-Indonesia has the most liberal visa policies I have encountered in the world, despite my personal conflict with the border guard, the resulting gathering of people showed just how flexible and dynamic - how alive - this society was.  The motorbike crowded streets were insane in regard to human safety, but full of adventure and zeal.
-<p />
-As I sat there, with the ocean waves lapping against my heart - something stirred deeper and deeper inside me.  I had lived next to the ocean for 12 months in Arica, Chile - and watched the waves from my beautiful hilltop appartment - and the kind and loving families who had welcomed my now ex-wife and I into that society.  But here on New Years Eve in Bali - something really was going on inside me.  Here I was... having the same marriage conflicts in a second marriage, my partner unable to communicate deeply with me nor understand me.
-And I started to sense that more New Years were coming, that I had seen a calendar suggesting China had one, and I was already a Sufi Muslim - and knew that that was a third New Years.  And the ocean tides, moved by the Orbiting Satellite like clockwork - and even the joyful rainfalls every afternoon in Summer New Year of Bali.  I was far from my December Winter of midwestern North America youth that Bob Seger sings of in <em>Roll Me Away</em>.
-<p />
-Was I reacting to my education? Albert Einstein's e=mc^2 equation did not take into account his own Jewish education. He did not look at religion as biologically grounded as Joseph Campbell, Carl Jung and many others had.  That the human brain itself was a processing machine, and could reveal hints of the black holes and big bang of our own universe.  That our odd social behaviors, rituals, and even our wedding ceremonies can provide hints of what aspects of <i>uncertainty</i> that were missing from his mathmatics equation. 
-<p />
-Paul Simon's song <em>50 ways to leave your lover</em> - was perhaps recalled to me (having experienced it at the shores of the Gulf of Mexico on at the NOLA Jazz Festival), the beauty of this song - I now call a Siloutee of Love (in many art forms) - how easy it is to destroy in the universe, but not how hard it is to create.  How e=mc^2 is a lopsided equation.  Dark Matter - 50 ways to leave your universe - and how many ways to Big Bang it?  This is how The Little Prince works, the abscence, the lonliness, the isolation, the missing community - it speaks to All.  Here I was, in Bali - with rocket launches by Everyone.  A Christmas tree in a mixed Hindu Muslim society right behind me in that shopping mall.
-<p />
-Within weeks of that Bali New Years Eve, I was describing to my marriage partner - drawing on the glass wall of a shower that divided us - by drawing waves - that my own body hormones impacted my mental behavior. That I felt religion and biology - the prayer movemenets of Islam and even the calendar of Ramadan were interlinked to the black holes that spin our Star Solaris and our Moon.  I was using metaphors without full realization of how deep these connections really are inside our human brain.  My subconsious computer was crunching away at my education trying to make sense of a Socratic Logic when the world is not binary nor Socratic.
-<p />
-<p />
-Hey, it's early writing ;)  I just pour it on page, in overlapping waves, dupe and mixed, and then try to sort it out.

+Star Wars Episode 1 Fan Logic
+
+1. Actors can't act in font of green screen.
+
+so, if you tell an actor to gain weight, or put on a bunch of silver paint, or a 8 hour makeup each day to play a chracter... it's all good.
+
+But if you tell them to act in front of a green sreen, and they fail, they are good actors?
+
+Ewen McGregor?
+
+So good actors don't speak up that the directory is making them look bad?
+Good actors have no concern for the final product?  Just punch-card pretty Jewish girls?  Obey the boss?
+Too chicken to speak out against the director, writers - yet willing to speak out against microbeads and the envrionment?
+These are the heroes?  Who care for their art and not the CASH $$$$?
+Why don't they insist on a GROUP review, of the film, and offer even free reshoots of scenes.
+They aren't smart enough to understand director vision and just a pretty face and body?
+
+That's the reality being depicted here, that the writers and directors are weak and that actors are all good!
+
+Actors should be cowarrds, promote a bad film, and not speak out during production?  Because of $$$$ and image?

+The simplistic attitutes toward talent and change
+
+If "a good salesman can sell anything" - then how come real estate declines in areas can happen, ecnomic depressions, where salespeople can't just magically
+re-inflate it with their charisma and social talents?  How come films flop that advertising can't sell (Steve Jobs film recently) even
+when the content has high ratings and praise from critics?
+
+Then, also cult films like Rocky HOrror Picture Show - where people adopt praise for something "bad" or oddball, just because.  Or hard-core
+drugs that people know are poison / cause overdose / but can't give them up.  Smoking cigarettes serves as another example.
+
+People seem to like the conflict of myth. The wars, the disagreement, not the Love, compassion, forgiveness.  Marriage being a trend
+example - where friends seem to even encourage/sport over conflicts.
+
+Most sad, religion can be taught from a young age as translatable.  non-political, non in-grup.  But it often is not.  Historic patterns
+favor competition, tribe vs. tribe, and we are now facing a travel and communications revoliton that says we can see that such approaches
+are poor and misguided.  Exporting hate and warfare is not a good choice.
+
+=======
+
+You have to have a brain type that favors this rapid learning. Either high memorization or high talent with languages, etc. The thread branch kind of started out in exclaim that one guy could be learning 15... but ignoring that ability is a factor.
+Not everyone is good at singing/karaoke, dance, mathematics, songwriting/poetry, musical instruments, computer programming (multiple languages), etc, etc. People seem to act like language is just a matter of persistence and education.
+
+
+=======
+
+Yes, just like most people have to practice a musical instrument to maintain or grown in quality. And, the simplistic attitude that just because you can play one instrument "just anyone" can easily deal with being a multi-instrumentalist - which isn't true of most / average musicians at all.

+Professor Alexander theory of Addiction
+
+bonding is important.
+
+Bruce Alexander is a lot more modest about his findings in his own write up, which is a great read with much more insight.
+"At this point, it is too early to say conclusively if the Rat Park view of addiction is right or not, but it is not too early to be sure that the old theory that addiction is a problem caused by addictive drugs is far too simple. Huge amounts of research money have been spent researching the idea that addictive drugs are the cause of addiction and treatments based on that idea have been tried over the world. In the meantime, the once-small problem of addiction has globalized. Moreover, it has become absolutely clear that drug and alcohol addiction is only a corner of a much larger addiction problem! It is definitely time for a fresh direction in the theory of addiction, and I have a hunch – as well as a hope – that Rat Park might provide the starting point."

+sub: A sign of Reddit usage gone bad - unwilling to engage, link and read outside content
+
+I surely have seen patterns where people seem to go through extreme lengths to avoid information and past conversations (other forums) from *offsite*.
+
+There is also a very strong "team identity" against Facebook, etc.  Like it isn't all one big ocean/world/Internet in the first place.  Literally things can be one-click away on the Internet - but you get this kind of social identity that is self-segregating.
+
+I don't mean because they are on their mobile phone or need to mirror a paywall content either.  It's much more like a psychology addiction, a kind of "Circlejerk" and "Echo Chamber" of only wanting knowledge to be shared in a local style, tone, and format (within the pages of Reddit itself).
+
+When you reference books and quotes - people dismiss them without going into their greater context (the surrounding chapters, books).  People don't read the linked stories and endlessly talk about the headline only (especially if it is clickbaity and distortive - plenty of counter-opinion to offer - instead of just calling it out). 
+
+There seems a lot of addiction to the ELI5 mentality, "the perfect one-liner", and seeking out the most clever or shortest TLDR answer to things.  This seems anti-community in nature, sorting and organizing things to  point where only a certain style and popularity dominates.

+Condecending and Egotistical
+
+Insanity of values:  No idea of Campbell's Vivika - eternal from non-eternal.
+
+1. You have rich people who faulnt property wealth, eclusive travel, and backdoor social power/relationships.
+
+Yet, people don't consider that long-term behavior as egotistical. Instead they say:
+
+1. You phrase things condesendingly
+2. Egotistical interpretations of expression choices
+
+Orson Wells: "I got a lot of hell because of that," Welles later said of his verbal sign-off. "People think it's egotistic. The truth is, I was just speaking to a public who knew me from the radio in a way they were used to hearing on our shows. In those days we had an enormous public — in the millions — who heard us every week, so it didn't seem pompous to end a movie in our radio style."
+
+
+The arrogance is the listener's failure to actually care about humanity as a collective, the poor and rich dividde, etc.  Instead ot focus on a ton of superficial gestures, fashion, style.  All of which
+can be learned, falsefied and practiced.  Acting.
+
+Toward marriage, and individuality, and struggle...

+The Divided Artists
+
+Publc Domain was an important concept and idea. As was the Public Library.
+
+Artists should feel FLATTERED that another artists features a clip of their film, orplays their song.  It spreads the song, it shows that an EDUCATED artist enjoyed it.  What better compliment can you get except from a artist of your ability or even more experienced than you?
+
+Instead, copyright and contracts over money divide
+
+And the artists seem to get the least, and the public can't peer to each other and trade art with each other and reward the artists
+instead, these middle men divide it all up and turn everyone against each other.
+
+Peer fears peer, person who enjoys art can't share it with another
+and Artists fears artists
+and listener can not pick up the art and modify it and learn art, no
+a natural progression (like what you see with Troubadour stories, like Tristan and Isolde)
+
+you kill community, you make greed and money the highest concern. Not
+education of everyone, but only those with money.

+Falsehood of Education
+
+1. A general atttide is that 'education is good'
+2. How does that explain military education?  Taliban teaching? Bomb making education? Marketing and advertising education?
+3. Reserved and non-truths of society.  That advertising works. That medical knowledge, impacting all human bodies, is reserved and profited.
+
+Malala film shows her education vs. Taliban radio education.  Yet, this distinction is a barrier that is rejected.
+
+same Quran, but Shia Sufi and Sunni teaching techniques.
+
+And the role art plays.  Famous people cite films as inspiration to join NASA.  People cite Quran and Bible, etc.  Are these fiction or art?
+is Mohammad talkign to Alien God in outer Space, or the same source as William Shakespeare.  And what have others done with Mohammad's
+book in the name of violence, politicis, and power?
+
+==========
+
+When you cross-reference Myth, you cross-reference to the human brain.
+
+The Bible and Quran are not directly translated, they go through the brain translation - archetypes of the unconsious, PLUS period specific
+rules of behavior and technology.
+
+So you can translate the song PriceTag + Fire Inside to True Detective Season 2 - because of the brain, society archetypes.

And that's something no one can do anything about."

+"Drop the Mike"

+The desire to be heard, but twisted into a control scheme.
+
+This fantasy that words can be articulated, edited, so perfectly.  "The zinger", "the comeback", the "Final Word".  To devistate
+an opponent or a crowd - "Shock and Awe".  "Jump scare".
+erf
+The more people develop their edit and presentation ability - their timing of impressing others - the more it becomes
+the society value.  To mesmerise and draw attention.  The same thing depended on by Islamic Terrorist, advertising, famous people,
+and the iconic items of the wealthy (tall buildings, exotic cars, exotic clothing, items of hidden exteame wealth that invite
+people to scrutinze and look closer - in a false sense of "hiding due to modesty" - knowing that the powerful and wealthy
+have their life scrutinzied).
+
+Yet, many song writers tell of the next stage.  They get people to listen athetically, athestic arrest, but very little depth.
+
+This is the difference of Yoga at the strip mall.  There is only the physical act and none of the Upanishad and Buddha education of ideals and philosophy.
+
+Powerful and famous people already know, from actual life experince, how people disect their photographs and life's patterns. They
+know if a hair is out of place, or food spilled on their clothes, it's going to be noticed.  So they turn that around, concealing
+great wealth in surgery, cosmetics (paying thousands for hair, makeup artists, training, perfumes, cosmetics).
+
+This is why so often they go into the selling of cosmetics, perfume, fashion clothes, wrappers for phones, etc.  Because they
+are fully experienced in the mental behavior of millions of their fans. But the fans do not seem to be able to see it in each other
+the slavish following.
+
+Really, for the famous and powerful - it's almost impossible to avoid.  The expectation of the crowd is so concentratd on one point
+it is like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_tower - the force is unavaoidable.  So they don't debate the ethics or
+such (some do, like Tom Waits about Michael Jackson, and others).
+
+when the adience is so addicted to technology of editing, tweaking, re-tuning - they human is eliminated.  What they want
+is filtered and refined, extracted, interaction with people.  They do not celebrate the below-aveage, they concemn and self-segregate from it

+Fargo post
+
+This is about liberation of marriage and society in general.  In the same episode there is a mirror scene at the beauty shop:
+
+
+Constance Heck: "Oh, Ed says - so stop the presses! (mocking)", "Look in that mirror, hun, tell me what you see",  "You get your period? Then what girl, that's a woman",  "We surrender our needs to the needs of men. To our great determent!"
+
+None of this thinking makes sense in a *choice marriage*, a non-arranged marriage.  As they, the couple, are to work together.  Not fight (openly or secretly) money battles, not fight child custody battles, not fight future planning.  They have to *resolve* and *honestly* agree.  That's always been the real threshold of choice marriage.  Truth. All the way back to the year 1210 Troubadours education.  Fargo is highlighting a society where the meaning of marriage has collapsed, the education is absent, understanding has been taken *for granted*.
+
+The [1970's is when this nonsense started to become open warfare in the USA](https://www.papermasters.com/images/divorce-rate.jpg).  Serving society (your boss) and not your spouse.  **I am not talking about gender issues, I'm talking about marriage vs. employers and social systems**.  The 1960's liberated women and men from Christian Church, but what people did was just start listening to even worse ideas and systems.
+
+Hey, let's not plan a small business stable income for our future. And instead, given $500 to Lifespring - who is a cult like Scientology - who isn't honest with people that they are in the business of selling secret solutions behind closed door. So, a generation free of the Christian Church, to sell herself to her boss (job) and to Lifespring. No development of individuality.  The same theme is playing out with the family owned crime business selling out to the corporate-like men in business suits.
+
+The inner house / intimate mirror scene is directly connected with the Public  Beauty Shop Boss (Constance Heck) mirror scene.  How they are all servants to society, an abstract set of rules and values, mindlessly.  This housewife now has the freedom and equality of a professional man - they both work downtown and are employees of small business owners.  But, they have no freedom from their society - they have not developed/cultivated any depth of their own inner life, no depth of truth. (Troubadour year 1210 Truth.) The couple has a house, car, job, technology, structure, things - but no inner humanity.  Like Darth Vader or Babbitt.  Even the name of the Beauty Shop Owner seems a clue, "Constance Heck" [Constant Hell, like Dante's Inferno].
+
+*The word "Babbitt" entered the English language as a "person and especially a business or professional man who conforms unthinkingly to prevailing middle-class standards".* What I see here is the 1979 raise of the female liberated *Babbitt*.  It's like liberating women into solders - adopting the worst qualities of male psyche - warfare, murder, violence.  Birth control and no children - so become a Babbitt. She does not see creation, fertility, in her heart - no art, no song, no teaching, no writing, no community, [no invention of what women would do that never existed before] - she aspires to be a lone masculine Babbitt wolf like her boss. She values secrets, power.  A bunch of apathetic isolated individuals, fighting child custody battles, regardless if male or female. Men build buildings and structure, women make things alive and living.  This isn't women's liberation, it's both sexes becoming George F. Babbitt, women becoming conforming men.

+Fighting Generations
+
+We now see the influence Myth has on the brain.
+
+A generation grown up on 1970's rock - their brains are adjusted.
+
+Just as T. Learly said about computers.  And the modern 4chan Robots.
+
+The extreme intensity htat people hold, and even religious associations.
+
+1. Banning of music
+2. "Rock and role ain't noise pollution"
+
+Campbell: herasy is the lifeblood of a myth.  What campbell means is: changing tastes keep music alive, not stagment and shrinking.
+
+What we have failed to do is learn from this cultural experience.  This is the single largest failure of the modern times.  To not
+end wars, etc.
+
+John Lennon in Imagine articulated this to us directly, crticizing to see it in music (and his own fan backlash of his wife, and the advent of Bagism - from The Little Prince). The Little Prince itself
+articulates it directly on the first chpter - neck ties and other adult failures to see the Hat as a Elephant.
+
+The little prince even uses generations, child to adult, to illustrate this failure of recognition.
+
+Jesus uses men to women:  Thomas: (114) Simon Peter said to him, "Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life." 
+Jesus said, "I myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven."
+
+Dante used it with heaven and hell, compassion dripping to deepest levels. As does Ambrosia from Buddha as tied together by Campbell.
+
+============
+
+Fighting liteally is a poor approach
+
+"A 2010 study found that though the barrier prevented suicide attempts from the Viaduct, overall rates of suicide by jumping for the city of Toronto have not changed since its construction.[15] However, according to a 2015 study, suicide barriers have had direct impact on reducing average suicide rates globally."

+Good side of Myth, art, stories
+
+Myth as poetry, not dictatorship aliens.
+
+Funny, if you say this about an individual:
+
+1. No friends, focus on only job and technical accomplishment - person has imbalanced life.
+2. Work and consumption is main use of time each day, no harmony with nature and freedom. Slavery, etc.
+3. Accumulation of money and cares little for strangers. Lack compassion
+4. Violence, serial murders/killers.
+
+If a SOCIETY, entire group does this.
+http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/world/asia/a-lonely-end-for-south-koreans-who-cannot-afford-to-live-or-die.html?ref=world&_r=0
+
+1. Entire society goes to war - murder, serial killing, it's a GOOD THING
+2. Entire society stops caring for each other but has better roads, automobiles, airports, buildings. GOOD THING.
+3. Entire society has less marriages, less loved children, more divorces. GOOD THING.
+
+Myths all over the world, the non-action violence view, not threatening death and punishment... have been saying this equation.
+
+That a society ignores it's group behavior.  Ironically myth gets turned into the same bad group behavior. And we have failed
+to see that the GROUP BEHAVIOR is the larger problem, not the myth itself!  But how it is educated and practiced.
+Not as poetry and personal to each brain, mind... inward to outward.  Instead, outward to inward - like 'declaring war' does to
+a socety - and all manufactoring, solders, etc.
+
+===========
+
+War being accepted, even if drone and no solder death, is sign of a lack of depth and authenticity to peace/love/compassion.
+
+===========
+
+"You mean the overabundance of gigantic malls that overshadow the squatter homes that are a handful of feet away? Sigh, it makes me sad whenever I go back to the Philippines and see the massive difference between the rich and everyone else." (reddit comment)
+
+https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3rc8hw/airport_security_in_the_philippines_have_been/
+This is what people odn't see: Culture is an export, and people wre talking about the airport
+
+So the eduation shows: edit the film, hire better actors, hire better CGI teams.  High standards of art influence people.
+And airports cater to the rich, just like shopping malls.  Doesn't care to elevate the society.
+
+===========
+
+"I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing — I was born with the 'Evil One' standing as my sponsor beside the bed where I was ushered into the world, and he has been with me since."
+– H. H. Holmes
+
+This is a person who can at least openly articulate their failed Myth interpretation.  They think of myth coming from outside
+and they do not see Myth as education of transformation.  Instead, they view it in "God's hands" and unchangable.  Their mind
+can not be repgorammed in their view, they hold faith to the birth view.
+
+This same thing is popular in soieties about war.  "It's the way it is, always has been, and always will be" - on a society
+mob / gang / group level.  Same as HH Homes articulates on a invividual level.
+
+And humanity will kill itself with this thinking, as it has done in the past.  Not just human death, but a spiritual
+death of the entire society - including new children who are givin this poison literal educaiton of Myth.
+
+PEOPLE WILL NOT GET PAST the Translation barrier of:  Poetry Myth to Science.  So w stay stuck on "one side of the pyramid" as Campbell
+talks of with Reason and USA values.  We stay stuck in this constant "is Myth true or false" logic, instead of
+"is this how the human brain perceives things" (Plato's Allergory of the Cave)
+
+People seeem unwilling to admit TRUE EQUALITY - and that SOciety is a operating system. Marriage is an operating system.
+Instead, it's system vs. system - and not a common equality of ONE BRAIN - one Monomyth system.  They won't go DEEPER
+than their own society educaiton / perspective.  "Christian" refuses to tralsate to islam, and Atheist refuses to translate to Islam and Shakespeare.
+
+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes#Chicago_and_the_.22Murder_Castle.22
+
+He provides a perfect example of Psyche industry failure. The lack of COMMON EDUCATION of Eternity and long-term.
+
+Jesus: Forgive 7 * 70 hits on the face, because long-term matters.  A basic Myth concept, Eternity, spirit.
+
+yet, people don't view H H Homes as a pATH, a SUSTAINED warfare. His elaboerate planning and construction. His 
+repeat patterns of using his HIGHLY INTELLIGENT MIND, his EGO system, of scheming for YEARS.  This is precisely
+warfare.  And not husband/wife domestic violence - which is often hormone related, chemical, spontaneous and can be altered
+by the two working together. 
+
+Domestic Violence attitude: Male A vs. Male B.  Change hubands.  Instead of proper answer: Change SYSTEMS - marraige is eternal
+and you may have to make very big changes.  Carry and Eppie Pen of hormones. Or divise a violence "safeword" to stop conflicts. Divise
+a layer of nets and safety systems - meetig places, phone calls, not REFUSING to talk and puttin Fear first (as Jesus teaches
+with 7 * 70 hits to the face) - but actually DEALING with th violence as a COUPLE - working together to understand
+the underlying hormones, strong emotions, and how to seperaete the violence (wheat from the chaf).  Isntead, the education is
+free, divorce, condemn.  A denial tht marriage produces both the STRONGEST of Positive emotions - and STRONGEST of negative 
+emotions (murder suicide).  In other words, we educate people not how to solve problems - overcome them - but to run away
+and condem the very animal that we are.  That's an anti-education, a animal behavior before Myth and Education itself existed!
+
+Same with HH Homes.  Insetad of: Well, ths is just like war.  Like the Pentagaon of USA deparmtnet.  What prt of the goverment
+teaches JEsus teaching?  Love, compassion, forgivenes?  Zero!!!  Only education school is Military officer training
+and press conferences. When do you here the president say: We need to grow Love and Compassion and translation of Bible to Islam
+adn to Shakespeare - that's the problem of Terorirsm?  Nope.  It's etiehr SANCTIONS or BOMBS or zero.  There is a complete
+failure of Reason.

+
+VR 60 minutes sports, adult statistics of reaction to "The Pit"
+
+-------
+
+We are at a unique point in history, to cross-reference and compare massive amounts of time.
+
+Yet, instead of seeing violence in the mirror - we play our old tribal games.  Faith that "the bad part of town has bad air"
+kind of thinkig.  Rich vs. poor. Good writers vs. bad (filtering and tuning out the bad, staring at mass-distributed content)
+
+Campbell: I once heard a lecture by a wonderful old Zen philosopher, Dr. D. T. Suzuki. He stood up with his hands slowly rubbing his sides and said, "God against man. Man against God. Man against nature. Nature against man. Nature against God. God against nature -- very funny religion!"
+
+
+And we believe we are so educated, advanced, sophisticated.  Exactly what MLK Jr was articulating - that we are devolving.
+That we build systems, but dehumanizing systems.

+
+comments about how stupid people are, deserve to die by nature, darwin awards, etc.
+
+===========
+
+There seems to be this levels:
+
+1. Conflict way of viewing things.  Capitalism, Republican, Catholic, Sunni.
+2. Conflict way of viewing things.  Communism, Democrat, Protestant, Shia.
+3. Non-conflict more complex way of viewing things, peer to peer: "True Democracy", Independent peers, Gnostic, Sufi.
+
+But isn't point this out, me, in conflict? No, because the conflict is there in our education. Transcendence is to overcome it.
+
+People take this so personally, they attack the messenger. That's what Campbell is spelling out throughut history.
+
+And don't stand up for your self. As the conflict oriented people find the most entertainment and war and combat. They
+are well practiced, highly intelligent, and highly articulate in defending WHY combat and war is good. Doesn't matter
+how many well-written books, songs, religions, prophets, speakers talk ALL peace for ALL people - some better talker
+always comes along and makes the case for violence and combat.  It's never a good day to take down our ICBM's because
+somebody is going to invent something worse next week.  It's a faith system that wins.
+
+The opening chapter of The Little Prince spells out this same frustration of depth.
+
+===========
+
+Bullying on Reddit and in general society.
+
+People seem to hold the attitude that they would criticze toward rape.
+"Dressed like a slut, so they deserved to be sexually assulted"
+They were naked, so they deserved to have sex - they were asking for it.
+
+Spoke like that style, deserve to be bullied and mocked.
+
+=============
+
+One of the most essential understandings of Myth is
+
+Faith in teaching, educaiton, philosophy, brain self-awareness. The mystery of "God" (not space alient off the planet, but subonsious Monomyth)
+is a solvable conflict.  That by understanding our own brains we can vasty decrease war, violence, hate, and so forth.
+MLK Jr articulation.

+Transportation and Express War
+
+War has changed so muchs
+1. Easy to crate weapons. Creating a knife is easier, repair a gun, turn a car into a weapon.
+2. Transporting weapons and soldiers very easy now, explosives, etc
+3. Speed of killing, ICBM's, etc
+4. Automation, security camers, laser scopes, GPS systems, Android phones - all add inteligence to weapons
+5. Weaponzed communications, lies and deception, poiticans tricking people into war. Islam tricking people into war.
+
+Yet, the peace system has been attacked.  Kumbaya is mocked. Hippies are mocked. Marriage ego problems are mocked. Individuals
+blamed instead of marriage ideals/systems.
+
+Technology has forced peace education to take 65 years instead of 18 years.  In 1964 it was 18 years, and we got it.
+But now, even with 65 years, I'm beind.
+
+So paying taxes, paying for Obomacare, etc.  How can I do that and not be part of these weapon systems?  I'm still trying
+to determine what is Reason - beause so much factory deception and killing has been built into the system.
+
+yet, I will be the one claim to have a mental illiness for caring what is going on with human education and technology.
+That war isn't already gong on in the world, and that guns and technology fo weapons and education hasn't influenced
+and accelerated war - and can be witnessed all over the world.
+
+I'm NOT stikcing my head in the sand.  I'm NOT just focused on my own person!
+
+If it takes 750 years to write a book, a novel, to stop this - then who should be thinking about it? And who should
+be supporting the writing of such a novel, helping organize it?
+
+-----------
+
+The apocalypse is finished, today it is the precession of the neutral, of forms of the neutral and of indifference…all that remains, is the fascination for desertlike and indifferent forms, for the very operation of the system that annihilates us. Now, fascination (in contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to dialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic passion par excellence, it is the passion proper to the mode of disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of disappearance, of our disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, such is our general situation in an era of involuntary transparency.
+
+— Jean Baudrillard, Simulacra and Simulation, "On Nihilism", trans. 1995

+non-lies reaction to a situation. There is no bravery in articulation of truth.  only if fake lies and

+Imbalance in interpretation

+Extremism. Radicalization.
+
+On all sides of Islam, even outsider, there is a "one side of a pyaramid" argument about extremism and radicalization.

+1. Topless protest in the street. Bra burning.
+2. Sit-ins and peaeful strikes like MLK Jr and Ghandi organized
+3. Arts and education on Love
+4. Free labor donated to construction / schools / libraries / houses.

+This kind of radilization, raising people to action, out of their

+This has been systemtimically de-emphasized since the 1960. Pro-war, Drug War, Terror war

+"his pursuit takes the reader on a tour of the Sumerian culture, a fully instantiated anarcho-capitalist society, and a virtual meta-society patronized by financial, social, and intellectual elites. As the nature of Snow Crash is uncovered, Hiro finds that self-replicating strings of information can affect objects in a uniform manner even though they may be broadcast via diverse media, a realization that reinforces his chosen path in life."
+
+This is a apt description of Edward Bernays advertising memes.

+The body that is infected by a virus does not become infected because it understands the virus any more than the body that does not become infected misunderstands the virus. So a world in which everything—from bitmaps to blood—can be understood as a "form of speech" is also a world in which nothing actually is understood, a world in which what a speech act does is disconnected from what it means.

+
+Jaynes further argues that divination, prayer and oracles arose during this breakdown period, in an attempt to summon instructions from the "gods" whose voices could no longer be heard.[3] The consultation of special bicamerally operative individuals, or of divination by casting lots and so forth, was a response to this loss, a transitional era depicted, for example, in the book of 1 Samuel. It was also evidenced in children who could communicate with the gods, but as their neurology was set by language and society they gradually lost that ability. Those who continued prophesying, being bicameral according to Jaynes, could be killed.[6][7] Leftovers of the bicameral mind today, according to Jaynes, include religion, hypnosis, possession, schizophrenia and the general sense of need for external authority in decision-making.

+this fits with Tomothy Leary's observation on computing, and my viw of Autism changing the OS through exteranl behavior learning of using video games and computers in youth.

+A failure to recognize this is exactly waht religion is.  The debate over Green Space Alien is Jesus or Allah has removed this.
+
+The clergy was non-profit.  And non-power-seeking.  It is political, selfish people, who seek POWER - who commondeered this teaching.
+
+It's sad is that the wholre world, all people in all geographic places and socities, is living in a darkness of the failure to translate this.
+Instead, it is: 
+
+- Space Aliens
+- Ghosts in the dark (not dreams)
+- War and violence, not translation
+- Selling "news" like this for one family, ignoring non-holidays. It is ONLY on Halloween that the reminder of compassion wakes up, not the other days.
+
+
+===============
+
+This trooper story, at heart, seems HyperREality.  People fawning over this good guy. 
+
+Reddit reply:
+Exactly. This is a triumph of Myth, of Halloween and Día de Muertos. It's living Art, but short-lived. It's a token Christmas gift on a special holiday.
+Like Islam where people go to mosque on Friday for 90 minutes - then come out ready to kill the people who go to Temple on Friday and Church on Sunday.
+Most of the tears cried here on Reddit thread are for a simulation of children. An image, a HyperReality. Like cries when a famous beautiful makeup actor kisses the famous breast-augmented actress. It's HyperReality squared. It's a token day, a vacation, a holiday, from the reality of Police and Government. Democracy, society, and non-downvote hate and anger - isn't just for tokens. It's ideal realized to be EVERY DAY, ALL THE TIME, and ALL PERSONS!
+Gospel of Thomas, it's message, has always been repressed and ignored by the militant power-seekers and their Hunger Games fans (Roman conquest).
+ ---
+
+What is that repressed message?  "Today, let's go find orphans and care for them".  Today, let's go find car driver s and
+fix their riving problem.  That's the Gospel of Thomas reality.  Fixing real problems, not murdering over which
+book is correct about Heaven - which famous Mohammd or jesus speaker.  Not fawning over the famous Jesus and Mohammad
+but actually convrting that passion into living Compassion.
+
+Campbell: "And of course what destroys reason is passion. The principal passion in politics is greed. That is what pulls you down. And that's why we're on this side instead of the top of the pyramid."
+"The big moment in the medieval myth is the awakening of the heart to compassion, the transformation of passion into compassion. "

+Offended, yes. It was the only word he could think of, and if he used it they would laugh —they liked him, he knew that, and they had accepted him as one of them, but they would still laugh. All the same, there were things that were not supposed to be. They offended any sane person’s sense of order, they offended the central idea that God had given the earth a final tilt on its axis so that twilight would only last about twelve minutes at the equator and linger for an hour or more up where the Eskimos built their ice-cube houses, that He had done that and He then had said, in effect: ‘Okay, if you can figure out the tilt, you can figure out any damn thing you choose. Because even light has weight, and when the note of a train whistle suddenly drops it’s the Doppler effect and when an airplane breaks the sound barrier that bang isn’t the applause of the angels or the flatulence of demons but only air collapsing back into place. I gave you the tilt and then I sat back about halfway up the auditorium to watch the show. I got nothing else to say, except that two and two makes four, the lights in the sky are stars, if there’s blood grownups can see it as well as kids, and dead boys stay dead.’ You can live with fear, I think, Stan would have said if he could. Maybe not forever, but for a long, long time. It’s offense you maybe can’t live with, because it opens up a crack inside your thinking, and if you look down into it you see there are live things down there, and they have little yellow eyes that don’t blink, and there’s a stink down in that dark, and after awhile you think maybe there’s a whole other universe down there, a universe where a square moon rises in the sky, and the stars laugh in cold voices, and some of the triangles have four sides, and some have five, and some of them have five raised to the fifth power of sides. In this universe there might grow roses which sing. Everything leads to everything, he would have told them if he could. Go to your church and listen to your stories about Jesus walking on the water, but if I saw a guy doing that I’d scream and scream and scream. Because it wouldn’t look like a miracle to me. It would look like an offense.”

+
+How to take boxing ring corners?
+
+This failure to recognize:
+
+1. Domestic violence of the moment, even if repeated, a type of circit breaker overflow, or a brownout underflow (of the relationship).  This is not about BLAME - this is about working together, the biology.
+2. Political protests violence - group harmonics

+As a South Jersey ex-patriot in Silicon Valley… you’re making me hungry!
+
+Robert Accettura hit the nail on the head… the thing that is next to impossible outside of the Philadelphia area is the right bread. There is a chain of shops in Southern California (Philly’s Best) that actually flies Amoroso rolls in daily (rolls must be fresh… eaten within 24 hours of leaving the oven). We may have to try Calvin’s on The Alameda in San Jose… it looks promising.
+
+Assuming you can find some “hoagie rolls” that approximate the genuine article… your recipe is close. Lose the pepperoni. Onions and peppers are optional. Salt and pepper are optional… not usually added. Oregano, oil and vinegar are recommended. Whole leaf lettuce and fresh ripe tomatoes. For the ultimate hoagie (recipe courtesy of Abner’s at 38th and Chestnut)… add a couple of slices of prosciutto ham.
+
+Graywolf – further north it’s called a sub. But in the Philly area it’s definitely a hoagie.

+The Competing Artists
+
+The 1970's shifted the focus of artists to compete not on truth
+
+THey no longer measured the success of the bottom of the society, they changed their measure of success to that of the power and wealthy.  How much record sales
+and top-money earning.  The admiration of wealth and power itself, not "raising tide lifts all boats" of the society.
+
+===============
+
+The 1970's were not run by the Executive Branch.  Those in power attacked artists, the 1960's cultural movement, and promoted a set of values that had people depend on jobs... not be free.  The War on Drugs - the personal Psyche and artists... the massive power that celebrity took on (super-wealthy athletes, musicians, actors).
+
+The way to corrupt the artists was to make them greedy and worried about their marketable reputation.  Power and Fame rules over their life - and they are turned into machines who count their sales and top-40 rankings.  Exactly what the peer to peer 1960's cultural movement was not about.
+
+By controlling art, you controlled much more than the government.  People like Jimmy Carter didn't stand a chance, as the education system fundamentally changed away from art and artistic truth. [Logical money-earning behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh3Kk5tZSmo) became the supreme ideal, simpler and more shallow that the Eye of Reason.
+
+Some of the 1970's artists spoke up - some extremely popular artists - but most people didn't take it seriously and things kept marching on with the War on Drugs anti-Psyche war (and now the War on Terror - another Psyche war).
+
+The students of Edward Bernays know how to enslave the press and the artists! [Somehow you changed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGXYiIDTPDI)
