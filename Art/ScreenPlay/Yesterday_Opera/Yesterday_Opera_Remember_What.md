* "And so **the disc jockeys** helped this along in a huge way. And there’s all the nostalgia. By the way, one of the big marks of the loss of identity  is nostalgia. And so **revivals on all hands in every phase of life today**: revivals of clothing, of dances, of music, of shows, of everything. We live by the revival. It tells us who we are, or were." - MARSHALL MCLUHAN IN CONVERSATION WITH MIKE MCMANUS
September 19, 1977. https://www.Organism.Earth/library/document/mcluhan-mcmanus
