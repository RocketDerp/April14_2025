I have checked on your order details tracking and it has been confirmed that your order has been delayed by a margin. I am really sorry that you had to face this issue but I can see in my system that the stores had some issues and they assigned 2 drivers but due to system issues driver couldn’t accept the delivery that’s why they were unable to deliver your order. But now I want to be honest with as you that I don’t want you to wait anymore. In this situation what I can so for you is I can request cancelation on the order and issue you a $10 promo so you can place a new one with the express delivery so that you can get your order with a discount, would that work for you?

5:51 PM

You said
sure, discount would be welcome
5:51 PM

You said
oh, you want to cancel the order?
