# Wounded King

Monday, October 20, 2025 USA. The October 18, 2025 "No Kings Day" weekend has passed.

Our wounds run so deep, our mental one-bit brainrot of liberal vs. conservative bi-polor logic, left vs. right bi-polar logic. That is NOT what the Founding Fathers in year 1776 created for the American Dream Machine, a New World Order, [***Out of Africa***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans). NOT *out of outer space aliens, Eden*. 

Our Wounded King does not grasp or know he is wounded. Nor do his haters, nor do his hate audiences, those who prize mocking, those who prize hate. People do not understand, the human learning has been lost, repalced by "meme life" junk high-speed meme consumption since year 2013.

We have a wounded king. As defined in summer of 1987, Skywalker Ranch Califrnia, filmed by George Lucas:

Trump is a wounded king. Wounded November 8, 2013 landing in Moscow, Russia on a private jet.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The big moment in the medieval myth is the **awakening of the heart to compassion**, the **transformation of passion into compassion*. That is the whole problem of the Grail stories, compassion for the wounded king. And out of that you also get the notion that Abelard offered as an explanation of the crucifixion: that the Son of God came down into this world to be crucified to awaken our hearts to compassion, and thus to turn our minds from the gross concerns of raw life in the world to the specifically human values of self-giving in shared suffering. In that sense the wounded king, the maimed king of the Grail legend, is a counterpart of the Christ. He is there to evoke compassion and thus bring a dead wasteland to life. There is a mystical notion there of the spiritual function of suffering in this world. The one who suffers is, as it were, the Christ, come before us to evoke the one thing that turns the human beast of prey into a valid human being. That one thing is compassion. This is the theme that James Joyce takes over and develops in Ulysses—the awakening of his hero, Stephen Dedalus, to manhood through a shared compassion with Leopold Bloom. That was the awakening of his heart to love and the opening of the way.

Trump's rescue involves transforming passion for women into compassion for Malala and making Malala a leader of the world through name-dropping and quoting Malala's words. Trump has a Pussy Riot problem. Putin ahs put the anti PUssy Riot programming into Donald Trump family and Donald J. Trump's mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-bKFo30o2o 

### Trump: "The Injured One"

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: "But Abelard’s idea was that Christ came to be crucified to evoke in man’s heart the sentiment of compassion for the suffering of life, and so to remove man’s mind from blind commitment to the goods of this world. It is in compassion with Christ that we turn to Christ; and the injured one becomes our Savior.
This is reflected in the medieval **idea of the injured king, the Grail King, suffering from his incurable wound**. The injured one again becomes the savior. It is the suffering that evokes the humanity of the human heart."

### Trump: "Ask The Question"

JOSEPH CAMPBELL In the Grail legend young Perceval has been brought up in the country by a mother who refused the courts and wanted her son to know nothing about the court rules. Perceval’s life is lived in terms of the dynamic of his own impulse system until he becomes more mature. Then he is offered a lovely young girl in marriage by her father, who has trained him to be a knight. And Perceval says, “No, I must earn a wife, not be given a wife.” And that’s the beginning of Europe.

MOYERS: The beginning of Europe?

CAMPBELL: Yes—the individual Europe, the Grail Europe.

Now, when Perceval comes to the Grail castle, he meets the Grail King, who is brought in on a litter, wounded, **kept alive simply by the presence of the Grail**. Perceval’s compassion moves him to ask, “What ails you, Uncle?” But he doesn’t ask the question because he has been taught by his instructor that a knight doesn’t ask unnecessary questions. So he obeys the rule, and the adventure fails.
And then it takes him **five years of ordeals and embarrassments and all kinds of things to get back to that castle and ask the question that heals the king** and ***heals society***. The question is an expression, **not of the rules of the society**, but of compassion, the natural opening of the human heart to another human being. That’s the Grail.

MOYERS: And it is a kind of love that—

CAMPBELL: Well, it is spontaneous compassion, a suffering with.
