# Year 2014 Description

This morning I had a realization. That a descritpion of the situation described a payload.

That's how Russia behaved, that is how USA behaved. The everyday population.

Very few escape it. Malala escapes it, Nadya Tolokonnikova escaped it. But the wealthy children who go to other schools outside Russia and Pakistan don't escape the programming like Malalal does.

The Dumbing Down that media made people, just as Carl Sagan described in year 1995.

Once people accept the media environment programming of politics being mocking, sports-think, sports mentality. Then goodness disappears. That is how fragile reason thinking goodness was already in 1995 as Carl Sagan was describing.

"Russia-watcher Catherine Fitzpatrick, who documents Kremlin disinformation for InterpreterMag . com, says just as Moscow uses vague Internet laws to encourage self-censorship, trolls inhibit informed debate by using crude dialogue to change "the climate of discussion." "If you show up at The Washington Post or New Republic sites, where there's an article that's critical of Russia, and you see that there are 200 comments that sound like they were written by 12-year-olds, then you just don't bother to comment," she says.  "You don't participate. It's a way of just driving discussion away completely," she adds.

It worked. Now all that remains is simulacra as Rick Riderick described in year 1993:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"And I mean, you know, we see other people engaging in this same, sort of, attempting to reduce complexity. I mean, the political parties, to the extent that they exist at all anymore as anything other than fund raising devices, which I don’t know. I don’t think they have any ideologies because in a postmodern situation who would have an ideology except just as a momentary thing? Like your “Week as a Communist” by Suzie Saint Pierre at Duke [crowd laughter], “My Week as a Trotskyist”, “My Week as a Buddhist”, “My Two Weeks as a Follower of the Cult of Elvis”, I mean, these are papers that you could legitimately expect people to write if they still read or wrote. Not many people still do either – read or write, much – but in any case; reduction of complexity.

Let’s look at political parties for a moment. The Republicans with their great traditions have come up with a slogan of incredible sophistication: “No more tax and spend”. Now any you who can quack that one out could be a Republican. And I am using that in the Orwellian sense of “quack”; you don’t need to engage higher brain functions. All you have to do is say “Don’t take my money, and don’t spend it… well, except on me and my friends, but don’t tax and spend”.

Now it’s not that the Democrats are doing any better, I don’t guess that’s news. I mean, Clinton is now less popular than Castro. If Castro ran against Clinton, Clinton would lose by a few points. I mean, he wouldn’t lose big, but he would lose, you know, by a few points. I mean, especially in a three person race with Clinton, Castro, Perot and Gaddafi. I mean, I don’t know who would win. In fact, given this postmodern world any one of the four could emerge with the biggest one fourth depending on how they ran their campaign. Probably it would depend on who could hire David Gergen [crowd laughter]. I mean, if Fidel got to Gergen first, he might win the damn thing, we don’t know. But the Democrat’s response to this “tax and spend” is “No we don’t, nah nah na-nah nah: invest”

This is political debate in a democracy. No it’s not. It’s the simulation of politics. Ross Perot is not leading a movement. It is a simulation of a movement, follow me? This is not a populist revolt. Ross Perot is not Teddy Roosevelt, this is a simulation. Now am I putting it down? No. In some ways Ross Perot is paradigmatically more real than real. He is hyperreal – as opposed to Reagan – he, ah, really was a businessman that made millions. I mean, a whole bunch of billions I think is fair in Ross’ case, and so on. I mean in a way there is more reality to it.

In any case, the current political structures are way behind this curve. They don’t understand it well at all in spite of all the talk about “The Selling of the President“."
