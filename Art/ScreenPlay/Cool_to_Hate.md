How did Russia defeat the USA?

**Hearts And Minds** warfare. Russia found the way to convince people that the New Religion / L Ron Hubbard methods / #monomyth... the new religion is "hate is cool!" "Hate wins prizes!", "Hate has rewards"

That's how Putin won. Redefined "cool"...

**"Mind-fucking Opera"**

Lyrics:     
"There's a rock and roll singer on the television      
Giving up his music, gonna take up religion  #FWakeTakeUp    
Deserted rock and roll   
To try to save his soul"
