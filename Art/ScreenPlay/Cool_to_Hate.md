How did Russia defeat the USA?

**Hearts And Minds** warfare. Russia found the way to convince people that the New Religion / L Ron Hubbard methods / #monomyth... the new religion is "hate is cool!" "Hate wins prizes!", "Hate has rewards"

That's how Putin won. Redefined "cool"...

**"Mind-fucking Opera"**

Lyrics:     
"There's a rock and roll singer on the television      
Giving up his music, gonna take up religion  #FWakeTakeUp    
Deserted rock and roll   
To try to save his soul"

### Screenplay / script

That story told in "Success Story" song by The Who April â€“ 12 June 1975...

Could be translated at the metaphor level to Charlie Kirk.

1. Charlie Kirk was an entertainer / music ock star like 1975 society
2. Podcasting instead of traveling musican
3. Charlie Kirk traveled around on tours like rock music media storytellers, he was on his first stop of his tour in Utah when he was murdered.
4. Charie Lirk in year 2021 created "Turing Poitn Faith", "TP Faith", went into religion

A podcaster star went to be a preacher. All fiction storytelling. The Bible is science fiction stories. A preacher is a fiction storyteller.
