## South Park on 6 7

What do you know, I've been worried I'm out of touch with things and here you go, South Park jumped on the 6 7 just days after I created this GitHub page. I'm not lost in year 1924 Finnegans Wake, I'm [getting in tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee0p_RtWPyU) ... 176,725 views January 8, 2021  ... to the mass mind front of brain damage (anti-goodness) billionare (Truth Social to South Park entertainment-washing) trickle-down to youth.

PROMPT to Google AI: "what do children think the "6 7" joke means?

There are two distinct "6 7" jokes, and a child's understanding depends on which version they are hearing.    
The "7 ate 9" joke    
This classic pun relies on a child's understanding of homophones, where "eight" sounds like "ate". 
The joke: "Why is 6 afraid of 7?" The punchline is: "Because 7 ate 9!"    
A child's understanding: A child who grasps the joke has developed the cognitive and language skills to understand that words can have multiple meanings or sound the same. A young child who is still developing these skills might not understand the wordplay and will simply be confused by the non-sensical image of a number eating another number.    

The modern TikTok trend

* This newer version of the "6 7" joke is a meme that has no real meaning, and that's the point. 
The joke: A child responds to almost any question with "six seven," often accompanied by a specific up-and-down hand motion. It originated from a rap song and a viral TikTok featuring basketball player LaMelo Ball, who is 6'7".
* A child's understanding: A child understands this as an inside joke and a way to be silly. They know that the phrase has become a widespread trend among peers because it confuses and annoys adults, which makes it even funnier. For them, it's a way of participating in a shared cultural moment and bonding with friends over shared, absurdist humor."

I've seen so many people this past 10 years adopt "Trump-speak", anything meme consumers find odd or unusual, people repeat and repeat and adopt. With zero self-awareness what they are doing to their brains. Programming Trump into their minds. There is no escape from the people all around adopting Twitter-think Trump-thinking, Surkovian values.
