# The Medium Is

There is so much about media ecology that people do not study or learn. Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman.

March 1967 book "The Medium is The Mass Age" / people don't seem to relate to everyday life. Another meaning of that phrase would be "your voice is your message when speaking", your tone, your accent, your speed of speech (New York City in the 1980's was famous in USA for fast-talking compared to Texas or other cities). Your fashion is your message. Your venue is your message. Your tone of writing, your use of buzzwords and font choice is your message.

I'm not trying to be simple here. My point is that these things can be learned. People go to university and learn advertising and marketing.

* “The thing I hate the most about advertising is that it attracts all the bright, creative and ambitious young people, leaving us mainly with the slow and self-obsessed to become our artists.. Modern art is a disaster area. Never in the field of human history has so much been used by so many to say so little.” ― Banksy

I'm exhausted writing this topic, it is so painful to see Trumpism prized so high.

"The Medium is the Message" March 1967 is another way of saying "Vibe Politics", Trump is the master of Joe Rogan vibe media. There are people that audiences flock to because of face, voice, gestures, vibes. And that's the power of Trump. His unique vibes / speech timing / Twitter timing / his "moves and shakes". I think people do not take **very seriously* what Trump says about pussy grabbing and being famous. He isn't talking about just his own sexual exploits, he is talking about famous people he has had access to and witnessed. 

There are people in this world that crowds instantly trust and hand over power and wealth. The music industry / the recording and publishing cartels - you hear story after story from all over the world how this behaves. Taylor Swift can charm people in ways that irritate many. Joe Rogan same.

* 1993 articulation: "we get the phenomenon of Reagan, the hyperreal president. More real than real. I mean he’s better at being Harry Truman than Harry Truman. I mean, the distinction about what he is is lost in the hyperreality of his smile, which like the Cheshire Cat’s, you know, just gleams across his face. And we get for the first time a phenomenon never known in polling which is the phenomenon of not liking a person, but of liking liking a person. This is a sign you are dealing with the hyperreal. Let me go over that again: Reagan’s popularity was popular. When you went through the various traits of Reagan and what Reagan stood for and his policies and so on, ah, vast numbers of people disliked nearly all of them. What was popular was his popularity. And I don’t think that Reagan’s alone in this. **Show business figures had this same thing go on for years**." https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

My concern is that people don't recognize the anti-diversity of all flocking to a certain craze of Joe Rogan or beauty standards of Donald Trump prized for shit-commenting, shit-posting, shit-messaging, shit-leadership. My God, can we not get Reddit audience to stop prizing shit from Trump for OVER TEN YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS. The addition to hate, the addictions to mocking, the addition to fiction wrecking all nonfiction!!!
