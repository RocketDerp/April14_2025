# Marshall McLuhan Today

First off, to grasp

1. Marshall McLuhan
2. Neil Postman
3. Joseph Campbell
4. Jean Erdman

One must really spend time exploring and witnessing other people with Finnegans Wake and even Ulysses. James Joyce familiarity is not optional when understanding Joseph Campbell's marriage influence. McLuhan's Catholic relationship to The Church and Pope has to consider his vast interest in James Joyce. McLuhan *swims in metaphors* as Joseph Campbell emphasizes (myth as metaphor) throughout his teachings.

McLuhan’s Cryptic Writing Style

We begin with Marshall McLuhan‘s writing style, which many readers find extremely challenging.
A student once asked McLuhan, "Why are your letters to the newspapers so plain and your other
writings so difficult and obscure? McLuhan responded by saying,

This question highlights the difference between exposition and exploration. Anything that I
know I can explain quite simply and directly. I can package it. Nearly everything I write is
concerned with areas of exploration in which I am actively engaged in discovery. That is
why I say, ― I have no point of view. Anyone engaged in exploration uses every available
approach, every available foothold, every accessible crevice to which to cling as he scales
the unknown rockface. The actual process of dialogue and discovery is not compatible with
packaging of familiar views. A person engaged in exposition has nothing new to say, and
he cannot communicate the effects of participating in the process of discovery (McLuhan
1970).
