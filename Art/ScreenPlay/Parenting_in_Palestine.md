Is the story factual and true? Are there ciercumstance of the boy's activities?

Does it matter?

1. 8 year old boys can be killers. It's technically possible, real reality. https://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetail.php?nid=64279

More my concern

The parenting. The environment. The toxic ocean to swim in. That this is "God's World", that Allah and Yaweh in Palestine is the story people accept.

Not that humans are responsible for this, but "God's Will"

### Another Mother

"Another mother's breaking Heart is taking over"

"Another head hangs lowly   
**Child is slowly taken**    
And the violence caused such silence   
Who are we mistaken?"   

Parenting / the socity we create. History is a Nightmare born into.
