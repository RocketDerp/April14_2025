# Luke 6 : 7

Luke 6:7 

King James Bible: "And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him."

"there is a disequilibrium within the society itself. And everyone is challenged in his loyalty — are you going to be loyal to the tradition, to the form, to the morality and myth of your society, or are you going to be loyal to truth? They are two different things. This is the problem in teaching; this is the problem in bringing up your children; this is the problem that was beside me there at the lunch counter. The parents—and the teachers in those cases — were on the side of society: of the past, what has been achieved.      
And I think one can say that it is the tendency of society in general to take the position of re-asserting its authority, even against the truth. Societies that have chosen this pattern — they are the more numerous in the world. They are distinguished by the positions, liquidations, annihilations of all who speak out the truth is a crucial problem." - November 16, 1961. Joseph Campbell

George Lucas filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences in summer of 1986 / 1987 at the peak of his Hollywood power and influence and published [in "Power of Myth" 1988](https://billmoyers.com/series/joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-1988/):

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: The third function is the sociological one—supporting and validating a certain social order. And here’s where the myths vary enormously from place to place. You can have a whole mythology for polygamy, a whole mythology for monogamy. Either one’s okay. It depends on where you are. It is this sociological function of myth that **has taken over in our world — and it is out of date**.

MOYERS: What do you mean?

CAMPBELL: Ethical laws. **The laws of life as it should be in the good society. All of Yahweh’s pages and pages and pages** of what kind of clothes to wear, how to behave to each other, and so forth, in the first millennium B.C.

That is what Bible verse **Luke 6 : 7** means...
