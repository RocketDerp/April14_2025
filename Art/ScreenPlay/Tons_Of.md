Tons of Evidence.                
Bible, Quran, Torah. They all contain the same stories. We KNOW their sources. All from Levant, very small area. All stories that were popular. Bible story was Popular, Mohamamd told stories about Jesus. Except it was not first-hand stories. Even the Matthew / Mark / Luke / John stories in The Bible are conflicting and different.

Tons of Evidence.

ToDo: Carl G. Jung in this GitHub on Hitler is a Myth, a Mythology. A Walking Talking Mythology.    

Tons of Evidence that people favor fiction over nonfiction. That people are so in love with the Satan character to mock and hate upon, The Tony Clifton Character, draws so much hate and mockery... Tons of Evidence

Tons of Evidence people don't care to toss as much fiction monomyth story patterns into their anti-reality. A study of comparative mythology shows this time and time again. 

It is blowing up in our faces. The fiction addiction to Fox News HDTV fiction, to Russian's Internet Research Agency fiction, to Joe Rogan Experience fiction, our addictions to trash Reddit commenting / Bluesky low-effort reactionary dispsoable messages - is blowing up in our faces.

# Global 

I am EMPHASIZING it says Global. Ukraine, Russia, United States of America, Iran, Isreal, on and on and on.  

“We've arranged a **global** civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but **sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance** and power is going to blow up in our faces.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Sooner, the March 2013 World Wide Web media systems, the Internet Research Agency, has erased fiction appreciation. The abandonment of media ecology, the abandonment of applying Marshall McLuhan to Donald Trump. McLuhan's NON FICTION understandings to the fiction storyteling of Putin and Trump.

Sooner, blowing up in our face already.

Sooner...

Looking up at Bible Verse John 1:1 - they ask, where do they lead? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s
