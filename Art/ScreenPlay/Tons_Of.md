Tons of Evidence.                
Bible, Quran, Torah. They all contain the same stories. We KNOW their sources. All from Levant, very small area. All stories that were popular. Bible story was Popular, Mohamamd told stories about Jesus. Except it was not first-hand stories. Even the Matthew / Mark / Luke / John stories in The Bible are conflicting and different.

Tons of Evidence.

ToDo: Carl G. Jung in this GitHub on Hitler is a Myth, a Mythology. A Walking Talking Mythology.    

Tons of Evidence that people favor fiction over nonfiction. That people are so in love with the Satan character to mock and hate upon, The Tony Clifton Character, draws so much hate and mockery... Tons of Evidence

Tons of Evidence people don't care to toss as much fiction monomyth story patterns into their anti-reality. A study of comparative mythology shows this time and time again. 

It is blowing up in our faces. The fiction addiction to Fox News HDTV fiction, to Russian's Internet Research Agency fiction, to Joe Rogan Experience fiction, our addictions to trash Reddit commenting / Bluesky low-effort reactionary dispsoable messages - is blowing up in our faces.

# Global 

I am EMPHASIZING it says Global. Ukraine, Russia, United States of America, Iran, Isreal, on and on and on.  

“We've arranged a **global** civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but **sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance** and power is going to blow up in our faces.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995

Sooner, the March 2013 World Wide Web media systems, the Internet Research Agency, has erased fiction appreciation. The abandonment of media ecology, the abandonment of applying Marshall McLuhan to Donald Trump. McLuhan's NON FICTION understandings to the fiction storyteling of Putin and Trump.

Sooner, blowing up in our face already.

Sooner...

Looking up at Bible Verse John 1:1 - they ask, where do they lead? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfm4L0TGDrw&t=173s

... we set the light to John 1:1 TRUTH - to the source of JOHN 1:1 - to the dangeling stack pointer of John 1:1 Bible verse ...

Sooner or later... https://youtu.be/cfm4L0TGDrw?t=235

Sooner or later the origins of John 1:1 would come out...  the metaphro of John 1:1 - the source - who is the author? Who is "Born Again", at age 21? https://youtu.be/QGJuMBdaqIw?t=41 - spark it like the July 4th...

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet. A model for that is the United States. Here were thirteen different little colony nations that decided to act in the mutual interest, without disregarding the individual interests of any one of them.

BILL MOYERS: There is something about that on the Great Seal of the United States.

CAMPBELL: That's what the Great Seal is all about. I carry a copy of the Great Seal in my pocket in the form of a dollar bill. Here is the statement of the ideals that brought about the formation of the United States. Look at this dollar bill. Now here is the Great Seal of the United States. Look at the pyramid on the left. A pyramid has four sides. These are the four points of the compass. There is somebody at this point, there's somebody at that point, and there's somebody at this point. When you're down on the lower levels of this pyramid, you will be either on one side or on the other. But when you get up to the top, **the points all come together**, and there the eye of God opens.

MOYERS: And to them it was the god of reason [non-instrumental reason thinking in the human brain/mind].

CAMPBELL: Yes. This is the first nation in the world that was ever established on the basis of reason instead of simply warfare. These were eighteenth-century deists, these gentlemen. Over here we read, "In God We Trust." But that is not the god of the Bible. These men did not believe in a Fall. They did not think the mind of man was cut off from God. The mind of man, cleansed of secondary and merely temporal concerns, beholds with the radiance of a cleansed mirror a reflection of the rational mind of God. Reason puts you in touch with God. Consequently, for these men, **there is no special revelation anywhere, and none is needed**, because the mind of man cleared of its fallibilities is sufficiently capable of the knowledge of God. All people in the world are thus capable because all people in the world are capable of reason.

All men are capable of reason. That is the fundamental principle of democracy. Because everybody's mind is capable of true knowledge, you don't have to have a special authority, or a special revelation telling you that this is the way things should be.


MOYERS: And yet these symbols come from mythology.

CAMPBELL: Yes, but they come from a certain quality of mythology. It's not the mythology of a special revelation. The Hindus, for example, don't believe in special revelation. They speak of a state in which the ears have opened to the song of the universe. Here the eye has opened to the radiance of the mind of God. And that's a fundamental deist idea. Once you reject the idea of the Fall in the Garden, man is not cut off from his source.

Now back to the Great Seal. When you count the number of ranges on this pyramid, you find there are thirteen. And when you come to the bottom, there is an inscription in Roman numerals. It is, of course, 1776. Then, when you add one and seven and seven and six, you get twenty-one, which is the age of reason, is it not? It was in 1776 that the thirteen states declared independence. The number thirteen is the number of transformation and rebirth. At the *Last Supper* there were twelve apostles and one Christ, who was going to die and **be reborn**. Thirteen is the number of getting out of the field of the bounds of twelve into the transcendent. You have the twelve signs of the zodiac and the sun. [RoundSparrow: an analog clock has 12 numbers and a central rotating point.] These men were very conscious of the number thirteen as the number of resurrection and rebirth and new life, and they played it up here all the way through.
