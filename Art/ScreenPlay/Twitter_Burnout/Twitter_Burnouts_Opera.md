NOTE: NEW_OPERA_NAME This GitHub page sort-of serves as a "#OperasNamedIrregular" style pointer. To fit Bluesky size limits, etc. Normally I try to hashtag either "#OperasByRoundSparrow" or "#OperasNamedIrregular" on opening starting points.

Donald Trump is a Twitter burnout. I've been a professional in social media / medium since year 1985. I have traveled to Africa and the Middle East to study Twitter / Facebook / Reddit usage in the #ArabSpring2010

Donald Trump is a Twitter Burnout. His mind is conditioned into the patterns of Tweet thinking. And the people who react back at Trump are compulsively drawn into these conditioned Twitter mindsets.

As a society, when #Canadian Marshall McLuhan died in year 1980 and then Neil Postman died 2003 we were not ready for year 2007 iPhone 1.

### How did the USA let it go so far?

Because rural people who had avoided "nerdy" computers in the 1980's and 1990's in year 2007 encounter the most powerful marketing and public relations systems. AT&T comined with Apple Computers. The iPod had already developed a mental insertion into the rural population. The Apple iPhone 1 in year 2007 changed everything in. We have never gone back to year 2006 behaviors and mindsets in rural populations. Suddenly the entire WWW was pouring into minds of rural less-educated Americans / population.

The addiction and "Twitter Burnout" isn't jut Donald Trump at age 79, it is rural population. irritable, hate-filled, dehumanizing, angry, lashing out at information overload. Wanitng to cut out entire languages of Spanish and visitors - as the human mind is so overwhelmed by the World Wide Web mania. Every predatory technique from every religion and sales system in the world of over 8 billion people is now reaching direclty into the pocket and hands of Apple iPad and Apple iPhone users in rural USA. It is open season on these less-educated rural Americans.
