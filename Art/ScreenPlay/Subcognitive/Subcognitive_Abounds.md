# Subcognitive Abounds

John 1:1 interpretation ass-backwards abounds    

We are the source of John 1:1    
We The People of Pale Blue Dot create the metaphors of John 1:1    
This misunderstanding of direction, outer space to inner reaches, abounds.   

We climb up the pyramid to a higher view, a global perspective, a historical and current perspective. We create Wikipedia and what we leave out of Wikipedia is very revealing.

We coin new words, it is not hard to find new meaning in an old word.

“Our students are about to turn subcognitive...." 

"At stake...the most basic form of cognitive fluency... depriving them of indispensable opportunities to develop their linguistic mastery, and with it their most elementary powers of thought."
