The Forest for the Trees. The Total Mock-ery. Trump Sees.   

Trump sees star-struck. Trump can see the mass mind.  Trump sees how Tony Clifton audinence reacts. Eating out of the hands of Tony Clifton performances.

Bill Moyers: “Jesus had the eye,” he said. “What a magnificent reality he saw in the mustard seed.” He would quote the words of Jesus from the gospel of John — “Truly, truly, I say unto you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” — and in the next breath, the Koran: “Do you think that you shall enter the Garden of Bliss without such trials as came to those who passed away before you?”

Trump is your signal, We The People are last to know of our own media addiction.  We The People are the fools who trusted Trump, and Trump trusted Putin. The monomyth was cracked by Surkov. Our faith in mocking, our faith in mocking MAGA, our faith in mocking Trump, that is what Trump saw before all others. Surkov techniques of mocking media adictions with media adiction.
