# Your Grammer, Your Word Salad

If a handicapped person without legs runs in a marathon people cheer.

If I, Stephen Gutknecht, autistic, post on Bluesky and Reddit - I am ridiculed for having language differences.

SEE_ALSO: Screenplay: ["Babel Tower"](../Fiction_Within/Babel_Tower.md)

People call singers shit, songs as shit, writing as shit, worthless.

Low-effort isn't the insult as declaring someone's language as "A.I. or worthless". If I use AI, I strive to quote it in quotation marks and most of the time provide a citation / link for reference of generation of language.

People insult me all the time for quoting books of professionally authored and edited language. Which is my ENTIRE POINT.

ToDo: I've written about "prizing original writing" and copyright is brain damage here. Bring in links and or context content.

I don't think the problem in the world is getting more people into their own branch and leaf of the Tower of Babel / Treek of Knowledge. I think the crisis of October 2025 media ecology is everyone being on different pages. Filter bubbles defined year 2010. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble why I traveled to Algeria for the Arab Spring at the start of December 2010. I predictred it December 16, 2009 from Austin with my own obervvations of media ecology / comparative mythology / and Facebook / Twitter and less-expensive home computers in North Africa (and women being given freedom of education / English learning in North Africa: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html )

# Bigotry 

People in USA say "learn to speak English!"

"Lingustic Racism" https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210528-the-pervasive-problem-of-linguistic-racism

Having autism and the constant games people play with language and meme-speak and being bigoted towards out-groups, prizing hate. Tower of Babbel warfare and dehumanization.

# 2,000 year old

The Bible is 2,000 year old, and in my home nation USA, people prize The Bible and prize Church. All my family does. Donald Trump poses with Bible. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_photo_op_at_St._John%27s_Church

People get Trump to autograph The Bible. https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-profited-from-sales-of-god-bless-the-usa-bible-2024-8

My LANGUAGE concern of the Tower of Babel, verse John 1:1 word and language conflicts, is why so many people for OVER TEN YEARS - since June 16, 2015 - can not locate Bible verse "1 John 3:17" and reference it relative to Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Rupert Murdoch, etc.

This isn't a "word salad" issue, it is a problem of comprehension and understanding and locating TWO THOUSAND YEAR OLD CONCEPT on page "1 John 3:17" (verse) to match up to the real-world reality of USA year June 2015 onward. How Rupert Murdoch's wealth-praise media networks are programming HDTV channels and other media systems across the world to worship wealth leaders. The very definition of "love" as a word is in verse "1 John 3:17".

If we can't even get on the page of problems from the 2,000 year old book that is printed all over the place on paper and has dedicated Church venues all over the palce, what hope do we have geetting on the same page of meaning and topics with Bluesky and Reddit comments?

That's my langauge concern! Meaning! REAL WORLD. SEE_ALSO: [ScreenPlay Reality:Substantive](../Reality/Substantive.md)

That's one of the BIG HATE conflicts I see, the wealthy of the world programming machines of media, media devices, media networks, medium of delivery - to hammer economic prizing into minds and it's blowing up in our faces. The hate conflicts over media style / meme decoration / meme framing / colors and images on top of the words. Media ecology.
