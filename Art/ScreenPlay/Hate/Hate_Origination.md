# Hate Origination

A rural Trump worshiper (God / Jesus Trump symbolism system) can originate hate all alone. A single person can doa school shooting. A single person can bomb a school education center.

World Peace, workd compassion, love for all Pale Blue Dot - can not be accomplished as hard work by one person. It requires every person, all people.

It isn't competitive. When the whole world has world peace, there is no king who wins. There is no ruler who is a winner.

When a terrorist bombs a school, they consider themselves a winner.Having defeated education and science teaching.
