NOTE: this is mostly a todo page. Brainstorming 

All snakes.  Men are penis, men are "all snakes.". "All dogs go to heaven" - "men are dogs"

MOYERS: That is the idea in the Upanishads: “Not female, nor yet male is it, neither is it neuter. Whatever body it assumes, through that body it is served.”

CAMPBELL: That is right. So Jesus says, “Judge not that you may not be judged.” That is to say, put yourself back in the position of Paradise before you thought in terms of good and evil. You don’t hear this much from the pulpits. But one of the great challenges of life is to say “yea” to that person or that act or that condition which in your mind is most abominable.

MOYERS: Most abominable?

CAMPBELL: There are two aspects to a thing of this kind. One is your judgment in the field of action, and the other is your judgment as a metaphysical observer. You can’t say there shouldn’t be poisonous serpents—that’s the way life is. But in the field of action, if you see a **poisonous serpent about to bite** somebody, you kill it. That’s not saying no to the serpent, that’s saying no to that situation.
