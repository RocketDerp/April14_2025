# Galatians 6:7

President Tony Clifton, Trump is God / Jesus. Eternal mockery. Infinite Jesting. Minds blown into perpetual mock-back at Trump.

People can not resist mocking Trump and following the leadership of a Total Mockery.

Even when he is dead, the symbols and words of Trump will inspire more mocking.
