# Misleading

Since March 2013, what the IRA and CA has done to USA society is misleading people. Leading people down self-harm hate paths, to hate mindsets.

Creating media echos, butressing media content, to create flse-affirmations that people know where this is heading. Leadership signals into self-harm.
