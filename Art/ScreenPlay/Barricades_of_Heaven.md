# Barricades of Heaven

The walls of the Tower of Babel.  
The Glass sky celings of space travel.  
The metaphors of rising above.    
Rising Tide lifs all boats   
Age 16 threshold, puberty, teenage    
Pages Turning, the James Joyce experience, of not learning the pages on first reading or hearing.
