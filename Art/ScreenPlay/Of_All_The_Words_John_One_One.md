# Of All The Words, John 1:1

&nbsp;

Of all "The Words" in the Public Library, in the John 1:1 of world languages.

What people choose in October 2025 is mockery and insult and cleverness.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Cleverness itself

&nbsp;

* “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that [everything was possible and that nothing was true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Is_True_and_Everything_Is_Possible). ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”
― Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism, 1951

* borrowing from fiction: "We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost… The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all." - year 1940. https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

# Prizing "not copyright"

Prizing originally in word combinations, not plagurizing, not infringing copyright.

For now, my words I choose are that hate is the problem. Getting on the same page of hate and world peace.

The 1954 Equation

I do not prize my original words, I prize what describes our common situation.

People who prize hate and prize violence and prize the images and videos of others suffering are ruling this world. The sickness of attraction to watching with eyes to see others wrecked. The seeking of self-harm to Earth and self-harm to humanity.

It is these mindsets of hate that are a common problem. It does not matter what geography, skin color, gender, wealth class, the hate itself is the toxic problem causing all other problems. That is the 1954 Equation, the decade after World War Two realization.

And all the decades since February 28, 1954 have proven that equation to be true. October 12, 2025, Sunday - it is still as true in Chicago and Portland and Washington D.C. and Israel and Palestine and Sudan and Ukraine and Russia and on and on and on. And in every marriage, every parenting, every school shooting! Hate is the problem and we are teaching and educating each other how to hate with machines!

* "Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure." - year 1940, fiction, "The Great Doctator" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

### Scavenger Hunt

I think for at least some time period, we all should scavenger hunt the best words. And in Wiki / Wikipedia style refine and combine and contribute and edit them into our future plans and blueprints.

### Past words, yesterday and beyond

&nbsp;

Past words, words already written, dusting off. Some from yesterday, some from 1954, some from older.

#### God is John 1:1 

&nbsp;

Now, do not get too confused. To me, "God" is a metaphor, god is a concept, god is an idea.

JOSEPH CMPBELL: The source of temporal life is eternity. Eternity pours itself into the world. It is a basic mythic idea of the god who becomes many in us. In India, the god who lies in me is called the “inhabitant” of the body. To identify with that divine, immortal aspect of yourself is to identify yourself with divinity.

Now, eternity is beyond all categories of thought. This is an important point in all of the great Oriental religions. We want to think about God. God is a thought. God is a name. God is an idea. But its reference is to something that transcends all thinking. The ultimate mystery of being is beyond all categories of thought. As Kant said, the thing in itself is no thing. It transcends thingness, it goes past anything that could be thought. The best things can’t be told because they transcend thought. The second best are misunderstood, because those are the thoughts that are supposed to refer to that which can’t be thought about. The third best are what we talk about. And myth is that field of reference to what is absolutely transcendent.

BILL MOYERS: What can’t be known or named except in our feeble attempt to clothe it in language.

CAMPBELL: The ultimate word in our English language for that which is transcendent is God. But then you have a concept, don’t you see? You think of God as the father. Now, in religions where the god or creator is the mother, the whole world is her body. There is nowhere else. The male god is usually somewhere else. But male and female are two aspects of one principle. The division of life into sexes was a late division. Biologically, the amoeba isn’t male and female. The early cells are just cells. They divide and become two by asexual reproduction. I don’t know at what levels sexuality comes in, but it’s late. That’s why it’s absurd to speak of God as of either this sex or that sex. The divine power is antecedent to sexual separation.

MOYERS: But isn’t the only way a human being can try to grope with this immense idea to assign it a language that he or she understands? God, he, God, she—

CAMPBELL: Yes, but you don’t understand it if you think it is a he or a she. The he or a she is a springboard to spring you into the transcendent, and transcendent means to “transcend,” to go past duality. Everything in the field of time and space is dual. The incarnation appears either as male or as female, and each of us is the incarnation of God. You’re born in only one aspect of your actual metaphysical duality, you might say. This is represented in the mystery religions, where an individual goes through a series of initiations opening him out inside into a deeper and deeper depth of himself, and there comes a moment when he realizes that he is both mortal and immortal, both male and female.

MOYERS: Do you think there was such a place as the Garden of Eden?

CAMPBELL: Of course not. The Garden of Eden is a metaphor for that innocence that is innocent of time, innocent of opposites, and that is the prime center out of which consciousness then becomes aware of the changes.

&nbsp;

God is our education, our input, our senses, our hearing, our reading, our seeing, our smelling, our sharing, our teaching, our testing, our learning, our understanding, our mindsets, our comprehension. John 1:1 means more than just "words" of "langauge" and "poetry". We, Humans, are the origins of John 1:1 and the story itself, the storytelling of The Bible. Just as we are of other stories like Hamlet's Ghost and Star Wars 1977 film "Force Ghosts", the science fiction story of "angels" and outer-space aliens in The Bible / Quran / Torah.

#### Left behind, rediscover

&nbsp;

* "My friends, all I'm trying to say is that if we are to go forward today, we've got to go back and rediscover some mighty precious values that we've left behind. That's the only way that we would be able to make of our world a better world, and to make of this world what God wants it to be and the real purpose and meaning of it."

* "Now that's what we've got to do in our world today. We've left a lot of precious values behind; we've lost a lot of precious values. And if we are to go forward, if we are to make this a better world in which to live, we've got to go back. We've got to rediscover these precious values that we've left behind."

* "The first principle of value that we need to rediscover is this: that all reality hinges on moral foundations. In other words, that this is a moral universe, and that there are moral laws of the universe just as abiding as the physical laws. I'm not so sure we all believe that."
