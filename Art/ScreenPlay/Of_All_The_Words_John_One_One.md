Of all "The Words" in the Public Library, in the John 1:1 of world languages.

What people choose in October 2025 is mockery and insult and cleverness.

# Cleverness itself

&nbsp;

* “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that [everything was possible and that nothing was true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Is_True_and_Everything_Is_Possible). ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the **correct psychological assumption** that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in **cynicism**; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their **superior tactical cleverness**.”
― Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism, 1951

* borrowing from fiction: "We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost… The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all." - year 1940. https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

* # Prizing "not copyright"

* Prizing originally in word combinations, not plagurizing, not infringing copyright.

* For now, my words I choose are that hate is the problem. Getting on the same page of hate and world peace.

* The 1954 Equation

* I do not prize my original words, I prize what describes our common situation.

* People who prize hate and prize violence and prize the images and videos of others suffering are ruling this world. The sickness of attraction to watching with eyes to see others wrecked. The seeking of self-harm to Earth and self-harm to humanity.

* It is these mindsets of hate that are a common problem. It does not matter what geography, skin color, gender, wealth class, the hate itself is the toxic problem causing all other problems. That is the 1954 Equation, the decade after World War Two realization.

* And all the decades since February 28, 1954 have proven that equation to be true. October 12, 2025, Sunday - it is still as true in Chicago and Portland and Washington D.C. and Israel and Palestine and Sudan and Ukraine and Russia and on and on and on. And in every marriage, every parenting, every school shooting! Hate is the problem and we are teaching and educating each other how to hate with machines!

* * "oldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure." - year 1940, fiction, "The Great Doctator" https://www.charliechaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-
