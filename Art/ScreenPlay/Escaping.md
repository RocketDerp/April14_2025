Carl Sagan in his book (not just the poem) Pale Blue Dot made a point of out of Africa and ending on South Ameica and North America.

A fundamental misundertanding many Americans had.

Germany was a wake-up call. A crowded land where people couldn't run away from each other. The Jewish and the Christians, the homeless and the poverty after World War One (Germany at center of both of the first two world wars)....

People coould not "go west young man" within Germany. In fact, Donald Trump' grandfather did leave Germany and go to the west USA, to Seattle, to Pioneer Square.

That wasn't possible after everyone hated germany after World War One.

So people couldn't escape hate. Hate thy neighbor WITHIN Germany and against Poland, hate thy neighbor France, hate thy neighbors hate each other. Hate driven economy.

MLK Jr 1954, that is not long after World War Two. After witnessing Japan fall to Hate Thy Neighbor, just as Germany fell to Hate Thy Neighbor.

Mr. Rogers saw, MLK Jr saw.

And Cambridge Analytica and the IRA erased that comprhenesion.

The USA had affordable land up to 1983. Housing was affordalbe, you could move, if you didn't develop compassion within your marriage and family / paenting, you moved.

Leo B saw. Mr Rogers saw. MLK Jr saw. The Hoppies 1968 saw.

We can't escape and run away. There is no California and Alaska gold rush to get away from Germany like Trump's Grandfather.

We can't all be Trump family landlords in NYC. There just aren't that many landlords who have customers to profit off.

"Every man a king" - Le Mis.

There is no forest to cut down, no 40 acres and a mule. We ran out. Even Russia ran out and is taking Ukraine.

Love thy neighbor isn't optional. Democracy won't work without love of humanity.

Hate motivated economy like Russia 2024 and Germany 1941 is what you get when you consider love optional. 

If you don't love progress and you don't love goodness, you won't create goodness and you won't create progress. You will hate the Earth and wreck the Earth and you will hate human persons and make life terrible.

That is what Russia mastered teaching. Abandon "Love thy neighbor", abndon "Love thy enemy", abandon progress of Mr.Rogers and MLK Jr.
