# Public Helplessness

“Ours is the first age in which many thousands of the best-trained individual minds have made it a full-time business to get inside the collective public mind. To get inside in order to manipulate, exploit, control is the object now. And to generate heat, not light, is the intention. To keep everybody in the helpless state engendered by prolonged mental rutting is the effect of many ads and much entertainment alike.

“Since so many minds are engaged in bringing about this condition of public helplessness, and since these programs of commercial education are so much more expensive and influential than the relatively puny offerings sponsored by schools and colleges, it seemed fitting to devise a method for reversing the process. Why not use the new commercial education as a means to enlighten its intended prey? Why not assist the public to observe consciously the drama which is intended to operate upon it subconsciously?” (McLuhan, 1951)

# Mental Rutting

"Mental rutting is feeling stuck, unmotivated, and emotionally stagnant, like life is on repeat with no purpose, often characterized by boredom, low energy, and monotonous routines, but it's not a clinical disorder, though it can link to anxiety or burnout; getting out involves small changes, self-care, new experiences, and self-compassion to recharge your emotional reserves." - Google Search summary 2026-01-14 morning USA
