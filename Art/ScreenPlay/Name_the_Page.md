### "love for the poor"

&nbsp;


Bible verse "1 John 3:17" - why can't people name the page?

It is a FUCKING 2,000 year old story, and we can't NAME THE PAGE?

Monday, October 13, 2025. Donald Trump sells a Bible for $59.99, and we can not name the page? JD Vance meets with The Pope in year 2025, and we can't name the page?

"1 John 3:17" - that is the identifier.

Is it because of MS-DOS / PC-DOS and *colon* in the filename? Spaces in the filename?
