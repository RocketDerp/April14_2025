# GitHub Lecture Hamlet

Stephen Dedalus gives an impromptu lecture on Shakespeare's Hamlet in the National Library in Ireland, a scene that mirrors the lectures **Joyce** himself gave in Trieste Italy, where he discussed Hamlet and ideas that would later appear in **Ulysses**.

The Fate of Ophelia was horrific in Hamlet, the mass mind washed away, but Malala has risen in reality and truth, we shall mythologize Malala from Swat Valley Pakistan. Today is the day. October 9, 2025 and it is 13 years since her skull was smashed by a bullet and Taliban dragging down the monomyth patterns on a school bus. Malala had friends who were hurt, and she has a possie of girls with pens, keyboards, smart devices, Steely Dan Steam-Powered assertions.

# Off-putting

"The ninth episode of the novel, “Scylla & Charybdis,” takes place in the National Library, where Stephen Dedalus will deliver his much-anticipated (though sparsely attended) lecture on Shakespeare and Hamlet.  Excepting the second half of “Aeolus,” we have largely been in Bloom’s mind since “Proteus,” so the return to the intellectual density, social tension, and discursive loftiness of Stephen’s thoughts in “Scylla & Charybdis” can be somewhat jarring… perhaps even off-putting.  Some readers may be tempted to quit.  Don’t!"

# The Worst of Times

I do believe it is true.    
Rumor has it, it is the *end of Paradise Theater*.    

It was a world made for two, for both sides, for two and only two. The mass mind retreet into pairings. And now is our time to rewrite the Pale Blue Dot Operating Systems and assert the Great Seal of the United States of America's symbolism that goes beyond the mere men of the Founding Fathers. These sympbols of 13 go deeper to the Levant, and are Out of Africa on the Nile river that flows on the front-side 

I feel so helpless, like a boat against the tide... If the world inverted upside down.... James Joyce would always be there to give the patterns of the World Wide Web in our Indra's Net of metaphors and gems.
