### How teach again?

"How teach again, however, what has been taught correctly and incorrectly learned a thousand thousand times, throughout the millenniums of mankind’s prudent folly? That is the hero’s ultimate difficult task. How render back into light-world language the speech-defying pronouncements of the dark? How represent on a two-dimensional surface a three-dimensional form, or in a three-dimensional image a multi-dimensional meaning?" - page 317. 1949. 

### Metaphor to Metaphor translation

― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor
