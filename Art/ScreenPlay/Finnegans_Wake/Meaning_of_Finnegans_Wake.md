## Bible believers / Gentiles / Infidels

If you Read The Bible, believer or nonbeliver, why would you seek out the worst?

If The Bible is a cherry-picking stroy, what would you nut-pick?

"Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why."
Letter to Fanny Guillermet (Zurich, 5 September 1918)

If The Bible story is full of { paradox, contradiction, conflicted meaning } - why would you pick the hate-filled interetations?

The meaning with 20 insides, The Coach with Six Insides

the coach of the six insides is a
fascinating blend of mime dancing and
acting and music based on James Joyce's
Finnegans Wake.
It opened off-broadway two years ago and
immediately walked off or I'd better see
danced off with two major awards for
theater achievement the Vernon Price
award of the New York Drama Desk and the
Obie another highly prized off-broadway
Laurel and then there followed a highly
successful series of performances at
three important European festivals
Spoleto Paris and Dublin and
subsequently after Canadian and American
tour the coach took off for Hawaii and
Japan where it made history as the first
American play in English to be seen in
Tokyo and as if that were not enough
widespread demands have brought about a
recent decision to send the coach out
through the United States again in 1965

I find the creator of the coach for the
six inside somewhat difficult to
characterize she is a concert dancer of
note she's a choreographer she's been a
performer in the theater she's been a
director in the theater and when I was
most puzzled I came across this when the
coach opened in Chicago Donald Hanahan
the Chicago Daily News critic expressed
his delight this way he says who
imagined that Finnegans Wake could be
dramatized. Jean Edmond that's who! Bless
her Joycean soul!

1:40     
She gave me as rich an evening as I've
enjoyed in many a season and perhaps joy
see and soul word somewhat up gene what
led you to privatize Finnegans Wake
well it's a wonderful thing to find a
piece of writing that is just made for a
choreographer and that's what Finnegan's
Wake is it's full all the language is
2:11
rhythmic
2:12
and poetic has many many layers of
2:15
meanings very suggestive you should
2:17
never try to decide what it what one
meaning is because there at least 20 for
every sentence you see so that in the
language of movement which can carry
images quickly and you can get meanings
quickly out of us out of movement so
this language doesn't bind you down to
defining things and as I began my career
dancing with pure movement I realized
that a vital rhythm is what's necessary
in the theater it doesn't matter whether
you just sit still or whether you move
around it isn't only in dancing that
rhythm counts you see your music so as I
added different elements to my works I
found finally that with this written
material I was able to find actors to
move in with me as though they were
dancers and I found the right composer
into AG Ito and the right designer and
Milton powers who did the designs for
the stage show in other words Finnegans
Wake turned out to be a natural
choreographer who wants to make a total
theatre event

3:10 

now we're going to see
only a small portion of what's a full
evening in the theatre when you set at
the stage for us yes what we're going to
