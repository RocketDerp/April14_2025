"Death by Flight Instructor!"

"The irony of the instructor making fun of the student for being dull only to miss a storm the size of Rhode Island directly in their path."

Donald Trump role model leader of USA society when all this happened. Even when Trump was not in office in 2023, people prasied and worshiped Trump and wanted more of Trump as a role model for social media postings / role model of leadership skills.

# We all rely on each other

The entire human race of over 8 billion living people all influence this world. And the prizing of hate for popularity, posting on social media to mock and insult, has become the role model. This is the outcomes of a person in late year 2023 who has lived since June 16, 2015 - all of his adult life, as elders in the nation praise Donald Trump as status symbol, icon, and even "Jesus" "God" returning to Earth. We are brain-damaging each other. We are injuring minds of each other. We do not see the forest for the tress of how hate and dehumanization networks. Faith in mocking for Internet wealth and power, meme mania has taken over society thinking - the abandonment of goodness, the abandonment of reason thinking. 

This man "alpha male" considered abuse and bullying as a core leadership and teaching skill.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the true becomes false and the false becomes true. That's what hate does. You can't see right. The symbol of objectivity is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.
