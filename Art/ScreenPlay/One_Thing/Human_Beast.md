## Joyce Takes Over

Joyce takes over... Partially serialised in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920.

1985, 1986, 1987   

"This conversation between Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell took place in 1985 and 1986 at George Lucas’ Skywalker Ranch and later at the Museum of Natural History in New York. Many of us who read the original transcripts were struck by the rich abundance of material captured during the twenty-four hours of filming—much of which had to be cut in making the six-hour PBS series."

I wonder if the 24 hours of transcripts will ever bee released. And they should be public domain for all the World Wide Web of mythology.
