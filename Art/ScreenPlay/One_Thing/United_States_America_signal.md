# United States America Signal

People like to think "legacy", it's more about "signal" and what peopole follow.

Hollywood was a leader, music industry with UK, the recording of imaages and sounds, with Japan.

The creation of artificial stories in films, in video games, with Japan.

Our signal?

1. We abandoned the reformation of Levant religions by MLK Jr 1950.

2. We did not see Malala on the world stage as the answer to 9/11 September 11, 2001 and Middle East.

3. We make TV shows and films and dramas about divorce and child custody battles and 'ex-lovers' and have develeoped no Leo B level teaching and education and we have not focused on Leo B and others who offer us a phasing out of hate.

4. Sports and games grew and grew, the wealth of sports stars and medical for sports stars, and wealth of team owners, and then the social media networks of gaming each other grew and grew.

5. We demonstrated with social emdia we all had a voice. We had social media first in every hand, and we all gave our foice, and our voice was Reality TV entertainers, Fox News values on Reddit and Bluesky. Block-happy deport-happy hate prizing.

We pized hate. We prized hate in our ex-lovers, we prize hate of our children with making Trump a role model for children, we prize hate of climate change denial to our children. We prize self-harm with RFK Jr to our children.

That's the signal we sent to the world.

Maybe the rest of the world will get worse, because we programmed that to people. We had freedom, money, to use Wikipedia or Reddit, and we choose Reddit. We choose Facebook over Wikipedia. We choose Elon Musk Twitter and Fox News over wikipedia.

Wikipedia and science learning we abandoned. We had a well enough written and edited book tell us this in 1995 before Facebook, before Twitter, before Reddit.. 1995 it eas there for everyone to read.

January 1994 even, before the 1995 book.

And we prized hate. That's what we prize is mistakes to insult. Calling everyone stupid dumb idiot brain-dead and all the other things when it is all of us not prizing Wikipedia.

Tragedy of commons that we had free time and spare time and entertained ourselves with hate. "Winning" over others, sports mentality. losers - insutling the losers.

We are all the losers.

January 1994. The 1995 book. https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/252618-the-demon-haunted-world

We are all the losers. We prized hate. We prized climate change denial. We prized bullying and tricking others into falsehoods as "winning".

We are all the losers.
