# Simplistic Answer

The 1954 Equation about hate many people may declare as too simple, simple-think.

Accepting hate, not changing, is the simple answer. Just continue to wage war while tehnology of faster execution on weapon systems advances.

Program our minds to think in machine time / systemic time of weapon systems and ignore the human brain is not evolving.

MLK Jr said "The great problem facing modern man is that, that the means by which we live have outdistanced the spiritual ends for which we live."

The technological means, the weapon means, the distance of weapons, while we do not celebrate goodness.

We need to face up to morality: good from bad. Stop prizing bad.

If prizing Donald J. Trump as a "LOL cow to milk" isn't enough evidence we have an attraction to Putin trust and Putin badness against Ukraine since year 2013, then what more evidence do we need that we have a macro-scale (forest for tree) problem of hate?

And is hate even any good at the tree level? Parents abusing thier children? Spouses abusing spouse with domestic violence? School shootings of neighbor gunning down neighbor?
