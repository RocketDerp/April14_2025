Burning smell in the air. 

"Long before 1933 there was a smell of burning in the air, and people were passionately interested in discovering the locus of the fire and in tracking down the incendiary. And when denser clouds of smoke were seen to gather over Germany, and the burning of the Reichstag gave the signal, then at last there was no mistake where the incendiary, evil in person, dwelt." https://ahistoryofthepresentananthology.blogspot.com/2013/06/after-catastrophe-by-carl-jung-1945.html
