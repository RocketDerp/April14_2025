# Arab Spring: December 16, 2009

The media to communicate became TCP/IP to the Algerian suburban homes in May 2007. The personal computer became a household option. If at least a young woman in Algeria did not have her own personal computer in her own house, she was now free to go to a friend's house and share a screen and keyboard.

Original experience has not been interpreted for you, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself in very difficult situations. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience — that is the hero’s deed." - Published Year 1988
