# Media Ecology

And used laptop computers from Europe. In May 2007, home computers became accessible to educated literate women for the first time in history.

The media to communicate became TCP/IP to the Algerian suburban homes in May 2007. The personal computer became a household option. If at least a young woman in Algeria did not have her own personal computer in her own house, she was now free to go to a friend's house and share a screen and keyboard.

# Bedroom Encoders, Sexual Revolution

Bedroom Encoders. Writing in French and English. Men were not attracted to "over-educated", educated women.

* "Algeria’s young men reject school and try to earn money as traders in the informal sector, selling goods on the street, or they focus their efforts on leaving the country or just hanging out. There is a whole class of young men referred to as **hittistes** — the word is a combination of French and Arabic for people who hold up walls." - By Michael Slackman. May 26, 2007. ALGIERS, May 25

"Those with less initiative, many of whom spend their days in hashish-smoking and petty thievery, are called "hittistes." The word is a corruption of the Arabic word heet, or wall, the primary object those men spend their days and nights leaning against."

OPERA_A Women were reaching out to learn about the world beyond those men who would not go off the wall. Family arranged marriage at age 17 was no longer the convention, choice marriage and choice to be single and go to university. If middle class young women could not coax local men into the university, coax men off the wall...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T88J6IzWAFg "Michael Jackson - Off the Wall" - Lyrics: "The world is on your shoulder"...

But it doesn't line up with my image of you... Would you mind very much if I added some spice?
Some sugar and cream and all things nice... there's a twist in your tale that doesn't sit right"; "Were you always aware of the gift you've got?
Were you wandering lost outside of the norm?
Am I getting the gist? Am I getting warm?
You're going to **have to help me** if you want a hand.
Well, I'm here for you, but I'm a busy man... So step out of the shade and into the Sun
I'm listening"; "cutting your teeth
Supposedly composing your masterpiece
If you give good copy then I'll cut you some slack
But you better remember when it all comes back
And you're lying on the corner of Merchant's Quay
Telling the world how it's meant to be
Well, I'll pick you up and I'll take you on"; "I can tell by your tone that you're starting to lag
Am I such a bore? Am I such a drag?
I could rip you to shreds, but I'm much too nice!
So while you're here take my advice:
Don't let the truth get in the way
A story's a story and anyway...
Your foot's in the door, so give me some...
You parasite..." 7,485 views  May 4, 2024 (Star Wars Day, May the Force Be With You, Finnegans Wake Publication Day)
