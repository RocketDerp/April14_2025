# Cynical Systemic Organized Systems Dehumanized

1. Hannah Arendt on cynical tactical cleverness https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Hannah_Arendt_quotes.md

3. Great Dictator, year 1940. "Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…" https://www.CharlieChaplin.com/en/articles/29-the-final-speech-from-the-great-dictator-

4. "That is **the meaning** of love. In the **final analysis, love** is not this sentimental something that we talk about. It's not merely an emotional something. Love is creative, understanding goodwill for all men. It is the refusal to defeat any individual. When you rise to the level of love, of its great beauty and power, you seek only to defeat evil **systems**. Individuals who happen to be caught up in that system, you love, but you seek to defeat the system." - King, Jr., Martin Luther (1957-11-17)

5. Erotic irony. Campbell, 1988: "But when he left to live with the bohemians, he found that they were so disdainful of life that he couldn’t stay with them, either. So he left them, and wrote a letter back to someone in the group, saying, “I admire those cold, proud beings who adventure upon the paths of great and daemonic beauty and despise ‘mankind’; but I do not envy them. For if anything is capable of making a poet of a literary man, it is my hometown love of the human, the living and ordinary."

6. USA health care

# Preachy on Health Care

Luigi doesn't fucking do anything but create sneak attack worship of video camera shootings. American gun stroking. Why are people not posting poor people on social media every 12 hours? Denied insurance claims? Paperwork and red tape piles? Record of phone calls and turnaround time? 13,000 cases as examples, day after day, every 6 hours, every 12 hours, put real names and real faces! [Luigi the video game character smoking](https://tenor.com/view/luigi-smoking-revolution-gif-984480169945063945) gang-sign messaging... killer... is priarily [celebrating ignorance](https://github.com/RocketDerp/April14_2025/blob/main/Quotes_Pile/Carl_Sagan_Quotes.md#celebration-of-ignorance). WHY was Reddit user Luigi Mangione unable to get the **NONFICTION BOOK** on the front page?

YEAR 2010 book. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay,_Deny,_Defend YEAR 2024 SHOOTING. Reddit account: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/reddit-account-linked-luigi-mangione-back-pain-surgery-rcna183674

WHY was Luigi not able to get on the front page of Reddit and organize THE BOOK reading and book quotes? because nonfiction is incredibly unpopular on Reddit since the Internet Research Agency invaded Reddit March 2013 onward. Anti-intellectual anti-nonfiction attitudes abound. Why isn't Dr. Bandy X Lee famous on Reddit, every single day since her October 3, 2017 nonfiction book was published? same Internet Research Agency conditioning!

Look at the fucking creation date on that image for this meme site: "Created: 1/24/2025, 7:33:45 PM". https://tenor.com/view/luigi-smoking-revolution-gif-984480169945063945 When all the gun-worship was raging on Reddit in early year 2025, the demand for that GIF image shot way up. All the meme-source sites added it. Information street gang signs. 1 Year ago tomorrow.

My street gang sign on Luigi is this: He is a real estate golf course family prince. Like Trump! Sure, in Corporate American Trump MAGA land - we can get free health care by making rent prices go from $1,700 a month to $5,200 a moth, now health care is free and rent is staggeringly more expensive! The GANG SIGN is "January 1944 Second Bill of Rights", the Whole Package! And what the intro has to **say bout dictatorships**. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights "People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made."
