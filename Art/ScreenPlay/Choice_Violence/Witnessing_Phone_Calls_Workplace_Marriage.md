# Witnessing Phone Calls Workplace

https://old.reddit.com/r/CoupleMemes/comments/1pijeii/my_wife_before_vs_after_she_sees_me/

I worked in a call center for Microsoft and Cheyenne Tape Backup. Software Spectrum, Garland Texas. Early 1990's. Microsoft Server side, not end-user Desktop.

Microsoft was afraid of government breakup like IBM after screwing IBM over OS/2 partnership. So they were contracting third-parties for independent resellers MCSE support engeineers.

I wrote Exchange Server book chapters while working there. Anyway... I hated the non-creative ruotine of a desk-job call center. They (Garland Texas accounting owners of Software Spectrum) even made us wear shirt and tie to take phone calls.

Strict lunch break, call coverage schedule, etc.

I only took the job because the were so desperate for new MCSE certificaion program that I had completed. That I madea deal to only do it for 18 months then I could be a Principal Consultant for any office they had. They later purchased Egghead Consulting from Spokan wich included a Bellevue office 6 months before my 18 month agreement was finished. So I took lead of Microsoft side of Bellevue consulting.

Anyway... working in a call center with 40 to 60 people in cubicles.

One thing you start to notce: Angry people at work who would change personality on a DIME for money. They would be aruging with another co-worker about sports or their children or marriage or dating - and be angry for 20 minutes. And as soon as the phone rings, they were a different person for $x/hour paid money. This REALLY made an 18 month stint impression on me about how people could turn on a dime with media ecology of a telephone. How they could be hostile and hate-filled towards a co-worker trying to explain an idea to them, and turn totally on a dime because they were paid money to talk to strangers.

My first wife, met in Dallas those same years... she was a 911 operator / call center dispatcher too. Carolton Texas. She lived in Anna Texas and drove past Garland on her way home.

It's amazing to me how people prize hate of ex-lovers. Like the Church / Mosque teaches to hate non-believers. Gentiles / Infidels. That an ex-lover has to be the most hated of all. Call center person demonstarted this to me with  every person in the room. And not a one seemed to be self-aware of this behavior. Holding grudges agaisnt people they spend the most time with, anti-understanding pro-stubborn pro-egoism pro-hate anti-forgivensss - but will sell their whole heart and mind to a stranger on the phone and calm down / slow down / listen to the same words entirely different mindset because of a headset for telephone calls.

Outsourcing USA 1980's 1990's - hollowed out a lot of humanism in USA to remote call-centers. So many people hate their job, hate hate hate and make work torture for eveeryone else.

I've seen and witness too many parents who treat their own children this way. Absolutely not listening and zero pateince with their 14 year old child - and then the phone rings and they are entirely diffrent listening. They hate their family more than anyone. Parents.

I have no children, but I've lived in houses of familiesin North Africa, Arizona, Georgia, Philsadlephia at times. And in RV travels from 1999 onward, seen a lot of familie close quarters out in the open.

People who prie hate as if it is a reward, payday, "payback". I do not enjoy hate. I just don't see anything good with hate.

some military weapon that kills 30 people in one swoop. It just doesn't thrill me, and I really struggle how people don't view it as a failure of humanity in total to come up with mental heath lessons / clergy teachings / communications understandings. How people prize weapon systems. Like police force who abuse immigrants and races every day. My wife working with police 911, saw some shit I could never grasp people being so motivated to harm others again and again.
