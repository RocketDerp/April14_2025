# Males Socialized Parenting Choice

https://youtu.be/VNLdyWPAz18?t=621

When you step back and listen to this, do people really have no sense GLOBALLY how men are socialized?

1. Be warriors / war heroes / killers / murders. Look at Putin's Russia and the December 2013 call for Male Domination Internatonal movement. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/

2. Look at Malala's empowerment of girls and how LITTLE people have stood up on social media in the context of Epstein standing up for topic. BOTH, why not call out men with one hand and empower Malala with the other hand? Why is it so one-sided that girls are not directly confronting men

3. This shit has been going on throughout history. It's embeded in religions! God himself is told to children that people are this way. I am NOT saying that is a good thing. But it is kernel-moode operating system of parenting.

4. Science and religion and computer industry - heavily dominated by men. Richard Feynman, Martin Luther King Jr, John Lennon all had intimate partner violence issues. Why are we not treating this as a PUBLIC HEALTH education issue like Malala is treating it. Education and teaching not brush it under the covers.

&nbsp;

Personally, it wasn't until I really focused on what Malala was saying that I realized the SCOPE of this issue. Campbell called it out in summer of 1988.

My Dad read this book from Leo B: [Osmosis isn't working](/Quotes_Pile/Leo_Buscaglia_Quotes.md) - but he never shared any books with me (a point I made at his funeral, he never shared any books with any of the family, despite reading books being a hobby he had my entire childhood).

Omosis isn't working. And Malala rose above blogging into a clergy critic role. Like Leo B. 

We are all so socialized to hate skin colors, gender conflicts (again December 2013 https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ )

With my autism, it feels like autistics in support groups for the past two decades have been told that they can't ready body langauge / sarcasm / satire / etc.  "Children with this syndrome do not recognize non-literal language that includes humor, irony, and teasing." - https://fountainmagazine.com/all-issues/2013/issue-91-january-february-2013/little-professor-syndrome (Safiye Arslan January 1, 2013)

But then after Septemer 11, 2001 I started digging back into Joseph Campbell's final words at age 82 / 83 in his last two books.

“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”
― Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor

His dancer wife, both at Sarah Lawrence College for women, observed this. In the Coaches With Six Insides, Jean E. made the point about 20 meanings for every sentence in Finnegans Wake.
