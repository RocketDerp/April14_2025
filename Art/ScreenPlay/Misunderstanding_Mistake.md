## Many Hate Clubs

Many clubs / many organizations / many congrigations / many clergy who all prize hate, cherish hate, accumulate patterns of hate teachings.

## I can not keep track of who to hate

I can not keep track of all the anti-forgiveness groups. The anti-goodness clubs. The people who prize anti-forgiving, anti-goodness, anti-compassion, anti-empathy.

The progress people want towards hate, the progress towards elimiating forgiveness. I can not keep track of all the poople I should never forgive, never love, never listen to. The network of prizing hate and the machines programmed to generate hate eclipsed my ability to keep track / keep up / juggle in my mind.

Mental overflow, brain damage, so many out-groups and out-clubs and out-organizations and out-individuals that I am supposed to teach a hate lessson to. To withhold forgiveness, to prize hate.
