Timothy Leary; quoted in Bukatman 1993; pg 139; 

"Computers are the most subversive thing I've ever done. [...] Computers are more addictive than heroin. [...] People need **some way to activate, boot up, and change disks in their minds**. In the 60s we needed LSD to **expand reality and examine our stereotypes**. With computers as our mirrors, LSD might not be necessary now."
