# *They* Do Not Read

I've seen this messaging thousands and thousands and thousands of times on Reddit. "Conservatives do not read", "Donald Trump can not read", "*They* do not read The Bible".

Zero concern for:

1. Interpretation. The Catholic Church reads the Bible book, but DISAGREES on interpretation with the Luthern Church.

2. Comprehension. People who blieve magical stories about Moses burning bush radio tower on a mountain that receives messages from outer space aliens. Magical angel outer-psace aliens who transmit messages to characters in THe BIble. People who believe The Bible is the one and only one perfect storybook in the entire world / public library, and that no other perfect book can ever be created (No Quran rewrites / science fiction retcon of Quran not allowed, no Star Wars 1977 retcon of The Bible story can be perfect, ONLY ONE perfect story, The BIble) that is factual / nonfiction.

“The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. Publsihed October 8, 2013

Does Malala say that Muslims don't "read The Quran", no they fucking read it, they memorize it, they re-read it OVER AND OVER AND OVER!

Clergy re-reads the Bible and Quran and Torah OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

Reading a book is not the issue!

Saying the book is the ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT SCIENCE FICTION STORY IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE is the problem.

It is a MINDSETE that PREVENTS ME from making a science fiction story, say The Egg fro August 15, 2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Egg_(Weir_short_story) - and saying that THIS STORY is EQUAL or BETTER than the 1,900 year old compilation of Matthew / Mark / Luke / John etc STORIES! 

Book supremacy, story supremacy, ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT BOOK EVER WRITTEN IN ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. https://isbndb.com/blog/how-many-books-are-in-the-world/

And that's only couting books. Star Wars 1977 is a FILM. And there are TV shows. And there are "ORAL TRADITION" that is spoken, or danced, or sand paintings, or WHATEVER ELSE can be communicated in any media / medium / wahtever!

it is the SUPREMACY of a story or of an interpretation taken to terrroism and hate!

People AFRAID of the overwhemlign number of human langauges, spoken and written, and newly coined words, newly invented languages (Pascal, C++, Ada, Python, Ruby, RISC V assembly langauge, JavaScript, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc,)

The TOWER OF BABEL CRISIS PROBLEM of people AFRAID of MORE THAN ONE SINGLE BOOK. The supremaecy of ONE PERFECT book fo the Torah / Quran / Upanishads / Bible - or "oral tradition story" or one INTERPRETATION of a story.

Mob mentality, street gangs, of books and stories and media venues (Mosque bombing Church, etc).
