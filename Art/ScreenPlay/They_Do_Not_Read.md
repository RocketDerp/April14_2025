# *They* Do Not Read

I've seen this messaging thousands and thousands and thousands of times on Reddit. "Conservatives do not read", "Donald Trump can not read", "*They* do not read The Bible".

Zero concern for:

1. Interpretation. The Catholic Church reads the Bible book, but DISAGREES on interpretation with the Luthern Church.

2. Comprehension. People who blieve magical stories about Moses burning bush radio tower on a mountain that receives messages from outer space aliens. Magical angel outer-psace aliens who transmit messages to characters in THe BIble. People who believe The Bible is the one and only one perfect storybook in the entire world / public library, and that no other perfect book can ever be created (No Quran rewrites / science fiction retcon of Quran not allowed, no Star Wars 1977 retcon of The Bible story can be perfect, ONLY ONE perfect story, The BIble) that is factual / nonfiction.

3. Understanding.

4. Routine FORGETTING! I, Stephen Alfred Gutknecht, read The Bible cover to cover in 1982 at the age of 12. I had been attending Church my entire life, as an infant, and I sat down on my own and read the whole damn book. Book that does not mean my memory always recalls things exactly when I need. I did not memorize The Bible, I forget passages. I have witnessed OTHER PEOPLE forget things from books. That is in no way evidence you did not read the book or understand it in a way most people mean of understanding a book or having read a book. Perfect memory recall is rather rare. And i can't even guess any more how many books I've read in my lifetime now. I can't even remember the number of books I raed, let alone every single idea and concept / verse and ayah from every book I've read. There are too many آيات

I could go *on and on* on this subject, and I do go on and on throughout this GitHub.

― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. Publsihed October 8, 2013

Does Malala say that Muslims don't "read The Quran", no! They fucking read it, they memorize it, they re-read it OVER AND OVER AND OVER! Terorrists READ The Bible, terrorists READ the Quran, terrorists READ the Torah, terrorists read thier books!

Clergy re-reads the Bible and Quran and Torah OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

Reading a book is not the issue! Hate is the issue. We ahve KNOWN this since February 28, 1954. It is now in every public library, the 1954 equation is on WikiQuotes! 

* February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr. - https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.

Saying the book is the ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT SCIENCE FICTION STORY IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE is the problem.

It is a **MINDSET** that PREVENTS ME OR SECOND-CLASS HUMAN ME from making a science fiction story, say The Egg story from August 15, 2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Egg_(Weir_short_story) - and saying that THIS STORY is EQUAL or BETTER than the 1,900 year old compilation of Matthew / Mark / Luke / John etc STORIES in "The Bible" book!

Book supremacy, story supremacy, ONE AND ONLY ONE PERFECT BOOK EVER WRITTEN IN ALL THE PUBLIC LIBRARY. https://isbndb.com/blog/how-many-books-are-in-the-world/

And that's only couting books. Star Wars 1977 is a FILM. And there are TV shows. And there are "ORAL TRADITION" that is spoken, or danced, or sand paintings, or WHATEVER ELSE can be communicated in any media / medium / wahtever!

it is the SUPREMACY of a story or of an interpretation taken to terrroism and hate!

People AFRAID of the overwhemlign number of human langauges, spoken and written, and newly coined words, newly invented languages (Pascal, C++, Ada, Python, Ruby, RISC V assembly langauge, JavaScript, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc,)

The TOWER OF BABEL CRISIS PROBLEM of people AFRAID of MORE THAN ONE SINGLE BOOK. The supremaecy of ONE PERFECT book fo the Torah / Quran / Upanishads / Bible - or "oral tradition story" or one INTERPRETATION of a story.

Mob mentality, street gangs, of books and stories and media venues (Mosque bombing Church, etc).
