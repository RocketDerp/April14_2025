# Lies Are Friends

All over the world, people choose corporation / bussiness leaders who hire public relations companies and advertising companies

All over the world, politicians are manipulators and liars.

The idea that people find liars to be the basis of good friendship. That people want liars to lead their children.

In USA, I was born in year 1969 and it seemed like the rejection of JimmY Carter to favor what came after was liars. Even Bill Clinton, it isn't just a political party or the other. But a We The People popularion all-inclusive favoring of liars and dceception leadership.

When Rush Limbaugh became "ditto head" leader....    
When Fox News became established mainstream...    
When July 16, 2015 came... it was pretty clear that this was a massive society wide problem.   

The abandonment of science. Carl Sagan 1995:

# Celebration of deception

Celebration of fiction / celebration of bamboozle. Celebration of monomyth.

Hey, I am all for celebration of Santa and Easter bunny deception. Not so much with Bible verse "1 John 4:20" and "I love Jesus" hate equation being ignored.

“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a (year 1995) foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time—when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness. The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the **30-second** sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of [celebration of ignorance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcY-x1VuWtE). As I write, the number-one videocassette rental in America is the movie Dumb and Dumber. “Beavis and Butthead” remain popular (and influential) with young TV viewers. The plain lesson is that study and learning—not just of science, but of anything—are avoidable, even undesirable.”

# Bamboozle Leaders

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”
― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**
