# Post-Credo

Post-Credo: Reference to "Libedo over Credo" 1988 Power of Myth nonfiction book    

BILL MOYERS: What did you mean when you wrote that **the beginning of romantic love** in the West was “libido over credo”?

CAMPBELL: Well, the credo says “I believe,” and I believe not only in the laws, but **I believe that these laws were instituted by God**, and there’s no arguing with God. **These laws are a heavy weight on me, and disobeying these is sin** and has to do with my eternal character.

MOYERS: That’s the credo?

CAMPBELL: That’s the credo. You believe, and then you go to confession, and you run down through the list of sins, and you count yourself against those, and instead of going into the priest and saying, “Bless me, father, for I have been great this week,” you meditate on the sins, and in meditating on the sins, then you really become a sinner in your life. It’s a condemnation, actually, of the will to life, that’s what the credo is.

MOYERS: And libido?

CAMPBELL: The libido is the impulse to life. It comes from the heart.

MOYERS: And the heart is —

CAMPBELL: — the heart is the organ of opening up to somebody else. That’s the human quality as opposed to the animal qualities, which have to do with self-interest.
