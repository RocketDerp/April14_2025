# My Experience of MAGA USA Faith values

From a person who had never stepped foot in North America...

I was living in Bali, Indonesia. I had no other home, this was my home. OPERA_A Now you are here in Bali, and you don't know why. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZoD8JEFjAE

On the flight into Bali, we had a stopover in Jakarta Indonesia. And I asked my partner, would you please plan two things for us:

1. We have 34 days to decide what to do for New Years Eve 2012 / 2013. Please choose which hotel and what you want / desire to do. Concert, live music, food, new clothes, dancing practice? I'll follow your lead.

2. Plan a train trip from one end of the nation to the other. Bali to Jakarta after New Years Day (Thursday January 3, 2013 noontime checkout from hotel onward). A train trip duration of 5 days to 25 days. 60 days after November 27 we need to renew visa to stay in Indonesia.

This partner had no other responsibility. All housekeeping was paid for, laundry was paid for, all cooking was paid for. No job, no employer. All expenses paid for, including medical. Unemployed person. Given unlimited Internet anywhere in Bali Indonesia and a new fully decked-out ThinkPad laptop. No limit on taxi or other travel expenses. This partner had over 30 full days to work on two requested tasks whenever they wished. 

I estimate the first task takes about 2 to 5 hours. We were staying in different hotels every few days, pick which one was favorite. The second task I estimate takes 4 to 8 hours of time. Which cities to stop at, which hotels for the first few stops? Any special places of interest on the train trip to stop and sight-see / visit? Any book clubs or bookstores along the train route? Any film clubs? Cinemas? Restaurants of interest? Public library, university campus? Museum? Concerns, any musicians in the month of January to check out of interest? I had all kinds of suggestions and encouragement I would mention a few minutes each day.

* "A direct land journey from Bali to Jakarta typically takes roughly 24–30 hours by bus/train combinations, but a **more relaxed, scenic trip — often involving stops in cities like Yogyakarta — is generally completed in 7–10 days**. In 2013, the costs for these overland methods were generally budget-friendly, with combined bus, ferry, and train tickets often ranging from $30–$50 USD total, though specific fares fluctuated." Google Search summary 2026-01-23 morning USA . Of course, the hotel costs for 25 nights and food is more expensive than the travel, but I did not set a budget.

* "A trip from Bali to Jakarta by land and train covers a distance of approximately 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) across the island of Java. The journey in January 2013 provided travelers with an immersive experience of Java's diverse and rich geography. The route reveals a constantly changing landscape, moving from coastal areas with swaying coconut trees to the interior, where the scenery is dominated by fertile, deep green, terraced rice paddies, traditional farming villages (kampungs), and impressive volcanic peaks like Mount Merapi and Mount Ijen. The train lines often run through mountainous terrain, requiring the crossing of sweeping viaducts and passing through tunnels, which offered panoramic views of the island's interior, a stark contrast to the urban development found near major cities like Jakarta and Surabaya."

* "Bali (Denpasar → Gilimanuk): ~120–130 km by road. Ferry (Gilimanuk → Ketapang): ~5 km across the Bali Strait. Java rail (Ketapang/Banyuwangi → Jakarta): ~1,000–1,050 km by train" - I got out maps and covered this basic information at the start, November 25 on the flight to Indonesia. The partner had until January 3 afternoon, more than a full month, to make suggestions and pick places of interest. Detours and weeks of extra time were available options.

And we could roll as we go, spend 7 days in a city we liked at any point along the trip, or 3 days here, 4 days there, 25 days total. And there was money available for new clothes or luggage or handbags, etc. We had up to date Android smartphones and Google Maps. to mark places of possible interest. I took care of all the sim cards and data coverage technical planning.
