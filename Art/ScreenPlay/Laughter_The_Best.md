# Laughter The Best

Chuckle-washing serious problems.   
Late night comedy show banal-washing serious problems.    
Social media addicts "miling the LOL cow" to wash Donald Trump and Elon Musk behaviors.    
Joke-washing.   
Comedy-washing. 

A whole pattern of Surkovian mind-fuck techniques.

Laughter the best mind-fuck.

### Everything In Our Background   


“Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?”
― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, year 1985
