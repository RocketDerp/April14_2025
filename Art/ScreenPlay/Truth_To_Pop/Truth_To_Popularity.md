February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it**. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And **since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of **numerical interpretation** of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. It's wrong to hate. It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.
