# Nightmare

The Nightmare I live in USA since year 2013.

A trending that never ends. An Eternal September style sitution where somethng you had experienced once n a while in prior years crosses into year 2013 and year 2014 where it never stops ending.

The abandonment of reality.

I was diagnosed with autism in 2009 in Austin, Texas, maybe 2008 is when I started to learn about it and recognize it. 

The term "Neurodiversity" 

## Neurodiversity

The term "neurodiversity" was coined in 1998 by Australian sociologist Judy Singer. I think I encounterd the term for the first time in a meangful way in year 2008, a decade after it was coined.

In 2009, in my studying of media ecology leading to my December 16, 2009 prediction of the Arab Spring....

I was thinking about comparative mythology. And the neurodiversity of that. https://www.wnyc.org/story/dr-joseph-campbell-inward-journey-schizophrenia-and-mythology/ "National Educational Radio presents the Cooper Union Forum, a program recorded at the Great Hall of the Cooper Union in New York City by station WNYC. This presentation, a lecture by Dr. Joseph Campbell entitled "Inward Journey: Schizophrenia and Mythology" is introduced by Dr. Johnson Fairchild."

Mythology tribes, mythology conflicts. Chritianity spans blacks in USA: Martin Luther King Jr being one of the most famous black skin christians. It spans white people, my own family was Christain, etc. But people are very tribal about Catholic vs. Protestant. Lutehran vs. Baptist. Christians in Dublin vs. Christians in Fort Wayne Indiana. And Russian Chritians. And I lived in apartment under a church (a basement) in Amman, Jordan - an Islamic nation.

Shia vs. Sunni vs. Sufi. Persian poetry.

Software / microcode / firmware / BIOS / operating system bootstrapping / kernel mode vs. user mode, apps vs. operationg system, lots of metaphros and hands-on experience in these areas in my life since age 13.

Joseph Campbell uses a marsupial metaphor (Campbel: "a womb with a view") and a "second womb" for religions / mythology. Sort of like a virtual machine metaphor or a bootloader / linux GRUB system of picking multiple religions but sill being awake ;)

Puberty, age 13 teenage, age 18 wartime, age 21 Age of Reason / drinking age. Driving age 16.

Neurodiversity has a lot of meanings to me. I've been though a rleigion conversion for my second marriage, a Mosque in Africa, required to be Islam to marry into an Islamic family. Not many people have had that experience in life at age 41 in December 2010.

I've lived in 4 nations that did not have English as a language: Chile, Algeria, Indonesia, Malaysia. Indonesia a little less, because it was a tourist part in Bali - and English was more known for tourism / travel langauge. I lived as an everyday person, I was not a tourist in any of those nations, this was my home office / work from home situation, as I have worked from home since Steptember 1999. I've been in organized groups of home office workers, "Jelly" in 2008 / 2009 / 2010 in Austin, before it wasa big thing after the year 2019 pandemic.

I worked for a German company, SAP.

A "corporate steel factory" with a labor union is like a different workplace firmware. I worked at one when there wa a labor strike, and I was on the management side, and had to work in the factory during the strike. 
A USA "Corporate America" is diferent than SAP "Corporrate Germany" despite the IBM roots of SAP.  
A different firmware of my family in Algeria where the mother was illiterate and raised 11 chiildren vs. my family where my mother was widnows and remaired to my father and was an office worker in real estate with lots of paperwork and 3 children (2 from one father, 1 from the remairrage).

As Rick Roderick points out in 1993 about Super Mario Brothers as the teacher of morality. Raised on the Internet / personal computer at age 13 on is different. My second wife was 11 years younger, and her experience wtih personal computers was different at age 20 in Algeria vs. age 20 for me in USA because of ASCII vs. Unicode etc in 32 bit computers vs. 8-bit computers.

My second wife never lived outside her family home at age 30 when we married. She had never been on a date alone with a man before she met me. She had never been to a cinema for a film, even alone with family, due to terrorism in Algeria in the decades of her life.

I had lived with a girlfriend together at age 17 / age 18 for over two years. I lived with my first wife for several years before we got engaged and married. Very different firmware of marriage sysems to experience. My first wife and I lived together for over 13 years. We lived in Dallas, Seattle, all ove in RV, we lived in Chile together for a year. We lived in San Antonio / Canyon Lake. And agian, all over in the RV full time.

Neurodiversity has a lot of meanings to me when you view different religions, different eras of technology, different literate vs. nonliterate, gender roles in different nations.

Malala from Swat Valley Pakstian and her January 2009 onward blog has been life-changing reading and learning for me. Being able to compare that with my Arab Spring December 2009 onward focus and being in Africa alredy  living there when the Arab Spring became world famous December 17, 2010. 

The paper filing cabinet workplace firmware of the behaviors is very different from every employee having a computer and e-mail. That was my profession from 1988 onward. Changing office systems on a huge scale, big change in lifestyel for people.

Neurodiversity.

What's happening in USA since year 2013 isn't just a short-term trend, it hasbeen a consistent trajectroy.  Rick Roderick's 1993 trajectory descriptions in "Self Under Seige" has proven very useful to me since year 2015 in understnading and analyzing the situation. https://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/

Since year 2013 egomania has become prized. Out-group hate is prized.

Anti-diversity of thinking. Tribal religions has been prized. Hate of out-groups of other religiosn prized. Atheists hating upon Christians in USA since year 2013 has been a growing expeirence. Chistians hating on everyone else they percieve as imperfect christians or non-believers growing since year 2013.  Prior to year 2013, it was growing in diversity and acceptance and tolerance, but 2013 onward hate began in every seam and wedge possible.
