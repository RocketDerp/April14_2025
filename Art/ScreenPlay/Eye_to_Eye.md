&nbsp;

No use changing, that's just what We Humans Are.

1. Tower of Babel
2. War is our tradition
3. Hate is our tradition
4. Prizing misunderstandings is our traditin
5. Prizing secrecy of medical drugs, medical treatment is our tradition
6. Feeding falsehoods and deception into public is our tradition

Sonething *older than Time* (older than Recorded History), the Tower of Babel metaphor....
