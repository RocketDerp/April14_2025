# Pluribus for Littles namechoice

So it seems Google A.I. search on 2025-12-14 informed me that "Pluribus for Littles" and { Reddit / Subreddit } words associate with sexual exploitation of little children.

My attempt to build upon Ms. Rachel and Mr. Rogers metaphors of 2025 Ms. Rachel coverage in news did not go well.

I started over parallel with "Pluribus Learning", less poetic.
