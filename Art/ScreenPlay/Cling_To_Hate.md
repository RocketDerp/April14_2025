# Cling To Hate

Humanity prizes hate, clings to hate.

Putin in charge for 25 years, this is after the 1988 publication of Power of Myth.   
Putin in charge for 25 years, this is after the 1993 "Self Under Siege" lectures by Rick Roderick.   

People prize hate, prize violence, cling to hate, cling to violence as their secret back-pocket soluiton to all problems.

People willing to die for hate, willing to die for murder, willing to die for military, but not willing to die for education, teaching.

Stand up for ALL humanity, not just 'be a man' and take others out with you in a suicide-murder agreement that was planned the day the military factory was constructed.

The 1954 Equation is no joke. Our behavior is a joke. 

"And I also think that we have to, ah, be wary of the… overquick reduction of complexity. If some of this lecture has seemed a little weird or to go a little too far, it’s because I don’t want to reduce quite all of this to slogans. On the other hand, I don’t want it to not be funny, because part of the postmodern trajectory itself is a rather humorous joke on the human race which laboured for millennia to reduce working hours in order to produce leisure so we could enjoy this very leisure that then turns in a kind of vengeful act against us absorbing our leisure time, which was to be our living time, into time now spent in the service of what can only be called this inhuman spectacle. I mean, it’s a very bizarre and twisted fate to which postmodernity has led us." - Texan Rick Roderick, 1993, Duke University. https://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/

We are clinging to hate as if it is not an education mistake. Our clergy has been teaching hate globally, to 8 billion people. OUr teachers teach sports of competititon, not sports of rescuing and homebuilding for the homeless. Our Wikipedia set an example of how all medical knowledge, drugs, medicines, first aid, medical technology, best practices should be open sources. And even a "deeper Wikipedia" of medical taht allows more experimental and development in progress off the normal routine pages.

We as a speices are clinging to hate. Letting nuclear bombs point at each other and doing everything we can to laugh-away and mocky-away the danger of our own egomani

 I can't find much teaching that "mob mentality" is bad and we need fire drills to respond to emergency outbreaks of "MASS PSYCHOSIS - How an Entire Population Becomes MENTALLY ILL" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09maaUaRT4M

 We cling to hate, we as a species keep advancing our murder techniques and technology of killings, but we are not addressing the dog eat dog competitive programming we feed into our minds. The glory we give to hate. The prizing of hate.
