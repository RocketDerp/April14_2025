# All Speak John 1:1 

Bible verse John 4:14

Those who speak John One One is All of Humanity. All that bark, all that tweet, all that speak.

My words, Stephen Alfred Guknecht, are equal to Mohammad's words, are equal to Jesus' words, are equal to John One One.

It is this failure to translate Bible verse John 1:1 to Shakespeare's Hamlet Ghost, to Star Wars 1977 "Force Ghost" to my OWN words and writings that is at the heart of this GitHub and Opera.

All men are speaking for all men.

All men are speaking the same recycled water, the same Tower of Babel conflicts.
