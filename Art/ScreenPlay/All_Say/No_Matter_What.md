# No Matter What

No matter what you say or do, people will distrust many autistic people. Being honest and sincere threatens people.

I had a hard time grasping this in autism support groups from year 2009 until year 2015 and the rise of Donald Trump popularity.

No matter what bad things or self-harm USA things Trump does, people trust him. Not just a dozen pepole, or hundreds of peole but hudnreds of MILLIONS of pepole.

A mannerisms / gestures / speech style / writing style of Twitter messages - that people accept no matter how many other people offer solid evidence and facts otherwise.

It says a lot about autism. The way people trust Donald J. Trump has a lot to say about people with autism.
