### Fiction vs. Nonfiction Survivorship

Fiction outsells nonfiction. Study all the media venues / media platform / medium of media... and you find fiction outsells nonfiction. Even when free, popularity of fiction.

The Torah / Quran / Bible history is "survivorship" because nonfiction is attacked, mocked, ridiculed, insulted, shit upon, destroyed.

### "What was the matter with them?"

BILL MOYERS: The troubadours cracked up that old world.

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I don’t think it was they, really, who cracked it up.

MOYERS: It was love.

CAMPBELL: It was—well, it was much the same thing. Luther was, in a way, a troubadour of Christ. He had his own idea of what it meant to be a priest. And that smashed up the medieval Church, really. It never recovered.
You know, it’s very interesting to think of the history of Christianity. During the first five centuries, there were lots of Christianities, lots of ways of being Christian. And then, in the period of Theodosius in the fourth century, the only religion allowed in the Roman Empire was the Christian religion, and the only form of Christianity allowed in the Roman Empire was the Christianity of Byzantium’s throne. The vandalism involved in the destruction of the pagan temples of antiquity is hardly matched in world history.

MOYERS: Destroyed by the organized Church?

CAMPBELL: By the organized Church. And why couldn’t Christians live with another religion? What was the matter with them?

### Known problem in Levant

2,000 yaars ago Bible verse "1 John 4:20" survives as a nonfiction problem in a work of fiction. "God" is a fiction character. "I Love Jesus" is wrong, "I Love God" is wrong, because God is a symbol of ALL LIVING PEOPLE. That is the equation of verse "1 John 4:20" - love for fiction characters is wrong / liars. 

The love one has for a fictoin character is not love at all. That's what "1 John 4:20" is saying. Being attracted to carefully crafted and edited poetry, oral storytelling, of God is not love like love of a living human person. They are completely different categories. That's the entire point of the egoism being confronted in verse "1 John 4:20" - the media mania people get over fiction storytelling, the mania over Torah poetry.
