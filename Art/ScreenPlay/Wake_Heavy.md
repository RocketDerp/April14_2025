# Wake Heavy

"The airplane call sign "heavy" indicates an aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 300,000 pounds or more, a designation used by air traffic control to warn about significant wake turbulence. This classification requires pilots to use the suffix "heavy" in their call sign to alert other pilots and air traffic controllers, allowing them to maintain greater separation and avoid the powerful vortices that heavy aircraft generate."
