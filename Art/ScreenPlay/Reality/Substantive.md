# Substantive

substantive: "having a firm **basis in reality** and therefore important, meaningful, or considerable."    
Definitions from Oxford Languages 

"The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30-second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming" ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, 1995, page 26
