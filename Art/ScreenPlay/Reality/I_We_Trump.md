Bill Gates and Trump, We, I.

"No nation keeps its word. A nation is a big, blind worm, following what? Fate perhaps. A nation has no honour, it has no word to keep. ... Hitler is himself the nation. That incidentally is why Hitler always has to talk so loud, even in private conversation â€” because he is speaking with 78 million voices."
- During an interview with H. R. Knickerbocker (year **1939**), quoted in A Life of Jung (2002) by Ronald Hayman, page 360
