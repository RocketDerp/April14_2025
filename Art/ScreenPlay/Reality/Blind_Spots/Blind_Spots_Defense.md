Sci-Fi Short Film "There Is No Antimemetics Division" | DUST | Starring Jasika Nicole   

* “Asynchronous research — whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over — is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics Division,”
― qntm, There Is No Antimemetics Division

* “It began as an experiment in advanced propaganda. The objective was to cut through the physical conflict and find a way to rupture the ideological machine, to obliterate the idea of Nazism. After two years, enough theory had been developed that the task had been reduced to an engineering problem. Another two years, and the engineering problem had been reduced as well, and what we had built was a very special kind of bomb.” ― qntm, There Is No Antimemetics Division
