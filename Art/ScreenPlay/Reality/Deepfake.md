"The war zone, in other words, may not be – in defending the self – may not be any of the classical ones. Like the working class versus the ruling class, the slaves against the masters, oppressed women against, ah, patriarchal society, blacks against whites. No, the struggle in the future may be to maintain the real against the unreal or the hyperreal or the irreal." - year 1993. Texan Rick Roderick. Professor at Duke University

# Machine Funded Mistrel Show

The machines are given money, the povery is being exploited for entertainment. Entertainment of seeing starving people in Palestine and USA. Compeittive USA free failures. The "losers", the bottom 20% of the bucket listings. The failures, the ones who should be killed off and stomped upon. ***PUNCHING DOWN*** on the bottom of society.

Neil D Tyson... is a black man and the billionare machines of technology have created a Minstrel Show of this man with Deepfake Deep Learning technology. Old-school revival, those days are over a long time ago, but the AI training has no morality firmware updates to the logic logic logic binary of out-group Minstrel Show hate patterns of popularity / toxic pop culture.
