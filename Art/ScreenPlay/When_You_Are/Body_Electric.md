"My main theme is the extension of the nervous system in the electric age, and thus, the complete break with five thousand years of mechanical technology. This I state over and over again. I do not say whether it is a good or bad thing. To do so would be meaningless and arrogant."     
Marshall McLuhan. University of Toronto.    
Letter to Robert Fulford, 1964.
