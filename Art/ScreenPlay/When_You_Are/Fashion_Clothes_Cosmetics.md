# Fashion Clothes Cosmetics

When I worked for Paul Allen Group in Bellevue Washington / NFL team owner / NBA team owner... there was the business card / job identity mask / brand / identity in Seattle.

Even when it is a non-famous person, go to strip clubs and study how men behave. Look at the men around you and how they react to cosmetics / clothing / mask of the women working their hardest to draw attention and earn money. The effort in cosmetics. Study the post-Woodstock liberation 1970's acts / 1980's / 1990's / before the Internet could do images and live video easily. (1971 was a post-woodstock year to study in USA https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/28/fact-check-9-things-women-couldnt-do-1971-mostly-right/3677101001/ )

Lecture I.1.2 - The Individual in Oriental Mythology     
By Joseph Campbell (Sarah Lawrence College for women)    
Date: February 20, 1961   


TRACK 2: Individual Identity in the Occident and Orient

To make myself clear, let me pause for a minute to say a few words about what seems to me to be the Western idea of the individual. I will take a few rather well known examples to illustrate the fact.

Carl Jung in his work speaks of the integration of the personality, and uses the word “individuation” rather frequently.  And to make clear what he means, he points out that each one of us is, by his society, invited to play a certain role, a certain social role in order to function. We play roles. These roles he calls personae, from the Latin word for the mask worn by an actor.

We all have to put on a mask of some sort in order to function in the society. And even those who choose not to function in the society—to revolt from the society—put on masks too. They wear certain insignia, you might say, that indicate, I am in revolt.

One can be impressed by a persona, by a mask. For example, if one meets a person and is talking to him and thinks one is beginning to establish some kind of rapport, and then learns, let us say, **that this is the distinguished ambassador from such and such a place, the mask comes in front of that person and a certain awe in your relationship to him**, and this person becomes what Jung calls a mana personality — a personality with magical powers — so that you are not talking directly to him.

In order to be individuated, in order to be an individual, we must distinguish between ourselves and the mask that we wear. Now this mask goes very deep; it includes moral ideas, it includes judgment systems. These archetypes for action have been impressed upon us by our society.

Now I take Jung’s idea of the individuation as a rather clean-cut example of an Occidental ideal: that one should put on the mask and take it off. **When you come home in the evening are you still Mr. President, or do you leave that in the office? If you keep your mask on, you know what we say of such a person: he is a stuffed shirt. The personality gradually disappears, and this is a particular disaster if one becomes impressed by one’s own mask**. Here we have a real mirage phenomenon: nobody there. 

Now let me say that the typical ideal in the Orient is that one should become identified with the mask. The whole pattern of education throughout the Orient is Believe what you’re told, do what you’re told, do not ask questions. For an Occidental teaching Oriental students, it is absolutely bewildering—the submissiveness. For an Oriental teaching Occidental students, the challenges are shocking. There is no respect for the professor qua professor.

TRACK 3:  Are You Your Body?

Now in the wonderful Inferno of Dante, as he wandered through these hell pits, he recognized all of his friends there as we should recognize ours if we went. And proceeding through Purgatory, and even to Heaven, he knew who those people were. Their personalities—their individual personalities—were preserved, even in the afterworld. The personality here is a permanent part of a permanent entity. You are born once, you live once—you are that. There is an identification with the body. In the Greek world, when the heroes go to the underworld, again they recognize their friends.
However, in the Oriental hells and heavens, whether of the Buddhist or the Hindu or the Jain type, you do not recognize anybody. They are not the same person they were on Earth.

Now, let me make a point. The hero in Europe—in the Greek tragedy, in Dante’s Commedia, in Jung’s idea of the individual—is this individual, this temporal being here now. In the Farther East of India and China and Japan, the hero is—and I’ll use the crucial word—the reincarnating monad: that entity which goes through bodies, puts them on and puts them off as clothes.

This is a continuing theme in the Orient, in the farther Orient. You are not this body, you are not this ego. You are to think of this as merely something put on to be thrown away again. A fundamental distinction here between our European concept of the individual, and that of, let us say, India and the Far East—the reincarnating principle makes quite unimportant this particular temporal phenomenon that we now are. There is an expansion of the ego concept, or an annihilation of it, so that it is not identified with this temporal phenomenon here now, but with the reincarnating principle. Now the differences from belief to belief, which I am going to try to describe, have to do with the identification of the monad. What is it that reincarnates?
