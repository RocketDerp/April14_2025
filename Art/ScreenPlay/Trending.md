Social media trending.    
Human relationships   

"Relationship Advice" since ChatGPT change out year 2022. Since the Internet Research Agency mind-fucking had parented for years and years.

Prizing machine lust, prizing social machines, hating on human persons.

year 2009, year 2010 is when I started to very seriously pay attention. Arab Spring in North Africa anlaysis from Austin, Texas. Met my wife in early 2010 on Facebook, traveled to Algeria December 2, 2010. This was before "block lust" was huge on social machines. Now we are in Eternal September 2.0 of block-happy eternal hate growth. It was not like that back in year 2009 and year 2010. Austin was the inside place to see the future trends, lots of tech companies from all over came to Austin in 2008 and 2009 for cheap parties and lots of booze and entertainment. Austin was far more cool than Vegas for younger crowds in 2009. I was living right down in 78704 in a rental house. 2008 / 2009 was also when I was diagnosed with autism and studying media ecology of autism. Very eye opening how autistic people are treated for langauge differences / language composition differences. My wife from Africa, she was a langauge teacher, her msasters thesis on teaching langauges was how we became friends in early 2010. I was cross-referencing her masters of Oran, Algeria to Ausitn Texas autism experiences.

Tower of Babel abounds. The abandonment of compassion and abandonment of comprehension of "1 John 4:20" - love of fiction characters vs. love of human persons (nonfiction *real* human people with langauge challenges - who don't have edited-refined poetry like "Allah" and "God" in a science fiction story Bible / Quran / Torah). December 2009 was a turning point for humanity. Malala was already blogging in January 2009 at age 11! Girls were given global voices not heard before. https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19899540
