"Relationship Advice" since ChatGPT change out year 2022. Since the Internet Research Agency mind-fucking had parented for years and years.

Prizing machine lust, prizing social machines, hating on human persons.

Met my wife in early 2010 on Facebook, traveled to Algeria December 2, 2010. This was before "block lust" was huge on social machines. Now we are in Eternal September 2.0 of block-happy eternal hate growth. It was not like that back in year 2009 and year 2010. Austin was the inside place to see the future trends, lots of tech companies from all over came to Austin in 2008 and 2009 for cheap parties and lots of booze and entertainment. Austin was far more cool than Vegas for younger crowds in 2009. I was living right down in 78704 in a rental house.
