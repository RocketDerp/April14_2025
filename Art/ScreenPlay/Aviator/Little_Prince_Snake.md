George Lucas in 1985, at the very height of his Hollywood fame and power, filmed lessons for Star Wars audiences at Skywalker Ranch. Published in 1988 book "The Power of Myth".

BILL MOYERS: Do you see some new metaphors emerging in a modern medium for the old universal truths?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: I see the possibility of new metaphors, but I don’t see that they have become mythological yet.

BILL MOYERS: What do you think will be the myths that will incorporate the machine into the new world?

JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Well, automobiles have gotten into mythology. They have gotten into dreams. And airplanes are very much in the service of the imagination. The **flight of the airplane**, for example, is in the imagination as the release from earth. This is the same thing that birds symbolize, in a certain way. The bird is symbolic of the release of the spirit from bondage to the earth, just as **the serpent is symbolic of the bondage to the earth. The airplane plays that role now**.
