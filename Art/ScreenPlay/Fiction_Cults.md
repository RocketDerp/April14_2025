The USA people knew we had a Fox News problem, every person in USA since year 1996 has had the experience of encountering Fox News audience members. Now in USA 2025, that problem has destroyed all goodness. Fiction cults. **Hate Abounds ; Dehumanization Abounds**

&nbsp;

People witnessed others who were in the cult of fiction, Fox News audience, it was a common experience in USA for the past 20 years (since year 2005). We knew and experienced that fiction storytelling was a problem. 

Society had to have weaknesses. There has to be problems that didn't get the proper attention and understanding. Neil Postman's 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" described the Fox News HDTV problem ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE. 1985 book describing October 1996 Fox News problems. We had education, we had prevention for ELEVEN YEARS in the 1985 book... but we, as a society, *We The People*, could only keep up with so many topics. Inforamtion overload, running out of time in the race with all the advances in technology and media.

Something had to blow up in our face. The Fox News year 1996 issue, the experience of Fox News audiences favoring fiction storytelling... we all had that around us. It grew and grew and grew, and then the year 2013 Russian Internet Research Agency media messages of fiction storytelling added to the Fox News audience fiction addictions. 

That is how we got where we are today in October 2025. That's the forest for the trees. We couldn't keep up on every issue, and the issue we didn't keep up on was a 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death" by Neil Postman.

Now We The Nation, United States of America, EVERYONE - not just MAGA, not just White Housse, EVERYONE - even people too young to vote, even non-voters. We are now here, and we do not know why. 

***Now you are here and you don't know why, we as a nation, don't know why** ... past the palces like Fox News year 1996, where you used to learn... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZoD8JEFjAE
