”This is an unauthorized use of my performance of ‘Danger Zone.’ Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately. I can’t imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together. We’re all Americans, and we’re all patriotic. There is no ‘us and them’ – that’s not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It’s all of us. We’re in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us.”

BILL MOYERS: Why is a myth different from a dream?

CAMPBELL: Oh, because a dream is a personal experience of that deep, dark ground that is the support of our conscious lives, and a myth is the society’s dream. The myth is **the public dream** and the dream is the private myth. If your private myth, your dream, happens to coincide with that of the society, you are in good accord with your group. If it isn’t, you’ve got an adventure in the dark forest ahead of you.

Finnegans Wake is a public dream.

* "The novel is designed as a single "Wakenight," covering the time between falling asleep and waking up. The narrative journey begins in the evening and concludes with the dawn, often interpreted as culminating around 6:00 or 6:30 a.m." ... "James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake is famously characterized as a "night book" representing the nocturnal dreams of a single night, primarily taking place within a pub-owner's home in the Chapelizod suburb of Dublin, Ireland." - Google Search summary 2026-02-10 morning USA

* “Jesus had the eye,” he said. “What a magnificent reality he saw in the mustard seed.” He would quote the words of Jesus from the gospel of John—“Truly, truly, I say unto you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit”—and in the next breath, the Koran: “Do you think that you shall enter the Garden of Bliss without such trials as came to those who passed away before you?” He roamed this vast literature of the spirit, even translating the Hindu scriptures from Sanskrit, and continued to collect more recent stories which he added to the wisdom of the ancients. One story he especially liked told of the trouble woman who came to the Indian saint and sage Ramakrishna, saying, “O Master, I do not find that I love God.” And he asked, “Is there nothing, then, that you love?” To this she answered, “My little nephew.” And he said to her, “There is your love and service to God, in your love and service to that child.” “And there,” said Campbell, “is the high message of religion: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these …’ ” A spiritual man, he found in the literature of faith those principles common to the human spirit. But they had to be liberated from tribal lien, or the religions of the world would remain — **as in the Middle East and Northern Ireland today** — the source of disdain and aggression. The images of God are many, he said, calling them “the masks of eternity” that both cover and reveal “the Face of Glory.” He wanted to know what it means that God assumes such different masks in different cultures, yet how it is that comparable stories can be found in these divergent traditions—stories of creation, of virgin births, incarnations, death and resurrection, second comings, and judgment days. He liked the insight of the Hindu scripture: “Truth is one; the sages call it by many names.” All our names and images for God are masks, he said, signifying the ultimate reality that by definition transcends language and art. A myth is a mask of God, too—a metaphor for what lies behind the visible world. However the mystic traditions differ, he said, they are in accord in calling us to a deeper awareness of the very act of living itself. **The unpardonable sin, in Campbell’s book, was the sin of inadvertence, of not being alert, not quite awake.**" - Year 1988, Bill Moyers, The Power of Myth

OPERA_A I'm from growing up in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Working on mysteries without any clues. Night hours of Finengans Wake. Trying to make some **front page** news... sweet Ramadan summertime 2010. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH7cSSKnkL4 - restless and bored. Steal away every chance we could, Skype calls and I used her, and she used me. Working on the Finnegans Wake movies. Working on humanity's adolescence moves. I felt the Joyce Thunderwords. 45,403,135 views July 10, 2020 How far off I sat and wondered in December 2009... started humming a song from year 1962. Strange how the Finnegans Wake night moves...

* I remember... autumn closing in year 2010. Start Date: Ramadan began on or around August 11, 2010. End Date: It concluded with Eid al-Fitr around September 10, 2010.

OPERA_A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H6re3PCP3E 11,749,234 views February 26, 2020 Gonna make you notice! "Gonna use my fingers, gonna use my, my, my imagination! 'Cause I gonna make you see...  There's nobody else here, no one like me"; "Can't miss a beat" 

* "Can't miss a beat"... ... "A Hindu text says, “A dangerous path is this, **like the edge of a razor**.” This is a motif that occurs in medieval literature, also. When Lancelot goes to rescue Guinevere from captivity, he has to cross a stream on a sword’s edge with his bare hands and feet, a torrent flowing underneath. When you are doing something that is a brand-new adventure, breaking new ground, whether it is something like a technological breakthrough or simply a way of living that is not what the community can help you with, there’s always **the danger of too much enthusiasm, of neglecting certain mechanical details**. Then you fall off. “A dangerous path is this.” When you follow the path of your desire and enthusiasm and emotion, keep your mind in control, and don’t let it pull you compulsively into disaster."
