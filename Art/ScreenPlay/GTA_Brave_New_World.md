"Grand Theft Auto: Brave New World" ... **Neil Postman Was Right 1985** 

The USA meme audiences are eating up the fiction storytelling of the White House. I have never seen Americans more thrilled, entertained, awestruck. Donald Trump is by far the most charming person to walk the earth.

Surkov governing applied to the White House and Truth Social is far more audience engaging than the domestic Russian media franchise. People here in USA can not get enough of the total mockery. Hate messages and mocking blows audience minds.

# "Politics has got to feel like a movie"

Published January 2015, before Trump started run for office in June 2015: https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/ At one end of the table sat one of the country’s most famous political TV presenters. He was small and spoke fast, with a smoky voice: “We all know there will be no real politics,” he said. “But we still have to give our viewers the sense something is happening. They need to be kept entertained.” “So what should we play with?” he asked. “Shall we attack oligarchs? Who’s the enemy this week? Politics has got to feel like a movie!”

# Politics has got to feel like *Grand Theft Auto*.

A video game. GTA.
