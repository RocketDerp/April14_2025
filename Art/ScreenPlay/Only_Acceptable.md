to sing to yourself if you are praticing an instrument, your voice in song.   
Singsong, Finnegans Wake    
to read prayer out loud to God you have never seen "1 John 4:20"    

If you speak in normal way, you are crazy, at least they say in year 2025 U.S. of A.

Other times, other socities, singing to yourself, singing out loud when nobody is around, dancing to practice or dancing to exercise. Jogging in a circle around the neighborhood or park - going nowhere... just to dance, just to speak out loud, just to exercise the language output ... is *crazy*.

Only acceptable if you ape talking to yourself in a book words from Quran / Torah / Bible / Upanishads. If you are originating your own words, not reading from a book, but coposing a book into a recording device - dictation device - then you are crazy or not, depending on people observing you.

This is how much we hate words from everyday people. This is how much peer to peer hate there is in U.S.A. society in 2025. You are "crazy" if you are saying words to your own self and it isn't an Apple iPhone you are speaking into. If you are just compsing words of your own origignal ideas, you are crazy for speaking to your own self.  That's how dehuamnizing we arer around the origins of John 1:1 Bible verse, who gets to orginate the langauge of John 1:1 messages.
