This is the VERY LOGIC here. This is evertying my GitHub is about. The Neil Postman 1985 book "Amusing Ourselves To Death", this is my VERY THESIS of Reddit, MAGA, GOP, Bluesky, EVERYTHING is Media Ecology: ***IF YOU DO ONE THING, PUT A JOKE ON PAGE ONE OF A BOOK OF HATE, IT IS ALL OK. IF YOU SAY IT IS COMEDY, AMSUEMENT, FICTION, ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING CAN BE TAKEN AS GOSPEL. THAT IS HOW THE QURAN, BIBLE, TORAH, UPANIDHSADS, BOOK OF MORMON, ALL OPERATE. ANYTHING GOES IF YOU DECLARE ONE JOKE AT THE FIRST PAGE. CALL IT A "RELIGION" INSTEAD OF AN "OUT-GROUP HATE CLUB, JOIN TODAY!" LEVANT FAITH SYSTEM!!! AND BEYOND LEVANT TO EVERY MEDIA SYSTEM. THERE IS NO SUPERNATURAL, NO BOOK IS MAGICAL, NO MEDIUM IS MAGICAL, THIS BRAIN LOOPHOLE CAN WORK ON ANY MEDIA VENUE FROM ORAL / SIGN-LANGUAGE GESTURES TO ANYTHING INCLUDING REDDIT AND BLUESKY.**** ... ... ...      

"Now that isn't the only thing that convinces me that we've strayed away from this attitude, this principle. The other thing is that we have adopted a sort of a pragmatic test for right and wrong — whatever works is right. If it works, it's all right. Nothing is wrong but that which does not work. If you don't get caught, it's right. ... That's the attitude, isn't it? It's all right to disobey the Ten Commandments, but just don't disobey the eleventh, "Thou shall not get caught." ... **That's the attitude. That's the prevailing attitude in our culture. No matter what you do, just do it with a bit of finesse. You know, a sort of attitude of the survival of the slickest**. Not the Darwinian survival of the fittest, but the survival of the slickest — whoever can be the slickest is the one who right. It's all right to lie, but lie with dignity. ... It's all right to steal and to rob and extort, but do it with a bit of finesse. It's even all right to hate, but just dress your hate up in the garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating. Just get by! That's the thing that's right according to this new ethic. My friends, that attitude is destroying the soul of our culture! It's destroying our nation! The thing that we need in the world today is a group of men and women who will stand up for right and to be opposed to wrong, wherever it is." - February 28, 1954. WE HAVE KNOWN THIS SINCE YEAR 1954!!!
