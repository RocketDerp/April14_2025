I suggest that a healthy thing for USA people is to make a list of 8 people you think would make good President and Vice President if an urgent situaiton came and from-scratch elections were agreed upon. Ideally younger people age 35 to 55. Refine the list weekly.

I think **Putin** [mind-fucked the population of USA](/Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md) **Since March 2013** 

People can not imagine anyone else than **Trump** being a constant source of stimulation with high-speed media networks. Making a list of 8 people who would be good leaders of the nation to break free thinking.

Mine?

1. AOC
2. Research: Saru Jayaraman
3. Research: Jim Conigliaro, Jr
4. Research: Reesa Kossoff
5. Lady Gaga ?
6. Research:  Jenny Mattingley
7. Vince Gilligan WGA February 15, 2025 convinced me
8. ?

I need help on this list!

ASSERTIONS: Vice President and President should be interchangeable, we should not be afraid to swap their roles if there are problems leading. We need to stop making this a job that only 1 person can do like Trump, and cultivate leaders. Second: we should not be afraid to remove someone and even re-marriage and put them back. It is a team that runs the White House / Executive. Good ideas and goodness over cult of style / fashion / entertainment (LOL cow milking) Trump provided. Lessons learned, progress.

ASSERTING: Reform. Wikitribune / Wiki-based news reporting on politics / governing / government / world news. History of edits, real identity, allow conflicts to be resolved by forked but still connected stories on disputes of sources or interpretations?
