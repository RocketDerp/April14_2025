I suggest that a healthy thing for USA people is to make a list of 8 people you think would make good President and Vice President if an urgent situaiton came and from-scratch elections were agreed upon. Ideally younger people age 35 to 55. Refine the list weekly.

I think **Putin** [mind-fucked the population of USA](/Operation_Matthew_4_19_on_monday_2024-03-31.md) **Since March 2013** 

People can not imagine anyone else than **Trump** being a constant source of stimulation with high-speed media networks. Making a list of 8 people who would be good leaders of the nation to break free thinking.
