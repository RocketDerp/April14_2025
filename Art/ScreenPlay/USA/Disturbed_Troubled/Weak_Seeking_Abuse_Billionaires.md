# Weak Seeking Abuse: Billionaires

the health care crisis of USA, the health care system has created a cultural behavior of "weak seeking", punching down by billionaires upon the weak, fragile, needy.

The response within the general Internet population since year 2012 is to prize hate. And instead of preaching "1 John 3:17" Bible verse to MAGA Fox News HDTV fandom.... to bully peer to peer of poor people to poor people.

"Belief" of the Bible does not concern me on this one topic. Literacy does. Can people grasp and understand translations of "1 John 3:17" verse?

And why is the clergy not making this verse well known? Signs on Church, postings on social media? Protest signs carrying "1 John 3:17"?

Does it not apply to Elon Musk USAID / D.O.G.E. in 2025?  
Does it not apply to Donald Trump and our national health care crisis?

This is a literacy crisis of people hate-seeking in a book to find valid reasons to spread hate. And ignoring and avoiding "1 John 3:17" reading and repeating.
