In USA, people seem unwilling and unable to recognize how much video gaming has changed values . Machine lust and human hate. Each video game generation unable to communicate with each other. Parents who can't connect with children. Anti-science, anti "real world of Earth" learning in favor of simulation.

Fox News / CNN / MSNBC / etc Television HDTV does the same thing. [See: Ted_Koppel year 2015](/Quotes_Pile/Ted_Koppel.md)
