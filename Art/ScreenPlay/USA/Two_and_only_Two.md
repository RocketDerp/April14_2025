# Two and only Two

One-bit logic, that there are 'both sides" to a problem. That there are "two sides" to every story.

1. Wrong answer
2. Second wrong answer

Since logic thinking is programmed into minds, that there is left vs. right brainrot values, that a 3rd or 13th answer can't be orgiinated / created because once you reach "two" sides of a problem you got it solved.

### Two Terms

I'm not suggesting this is "two sides" or "2" as a limit.

What I am saying is this is mind-fucking, Steely Dan Pretzel Logic, NYC Steely Dandom society pretzeled-up logic.

This is how you lodge a wedge between the one-bit "both sides" two number in a roundabout way.

Deep mind fuck, Deep manipulation, isn't always as obvious. But We The People are circeling around the "two and only two" patterns in the human mind, no matter how corrected or unconnected the concepts of both / two / sides.

We did our best with wrong answers, wrong thinking. 

The Great Seal of The United States of America sides are none of the logic-thing "both sides of the story" (witnesses can all be wrong in their interpretation, no matter if 2 or 3).

If anyting: Fiction vs. nonfiction. Goodness vs. badness. Morality of good and bad. And Putin Trump prize badness.
