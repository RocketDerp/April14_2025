You did not vote for this.

And if everyone around you starts voting for self-harm and suicide, you start asking DEEP and SERIOUS questions. You don't turn it into a mockery chamber of "Leopards eating voter faces of Americans, ha ha ha ha ha LOL LOL LOL".

* “Everything in our background has prepared us to know and resist a prison when the gates begin to close around us . . . But what if there are no cries of anguish to be heard? Who is prepared to take arms against a sea of amusements? To whom do we complain, and when, and in what tone of voice, when serious discourse dissolves into giggles? What is the antidote to a culture's being drained by laughter?” ― Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business, 1985

The Russia war against Reality mind-fucked people. People were not educated on media ecology. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMiHRZPQzjQ&t=49s

People use egomania / egoism to cover up mistakes. When they are suffering from **information overload** and contradictions - people had faith in USA. That it was a minor problem and would work itself out. Well, Russia mind-fucking EVERY PERSON, not just MAGA, not just Republicans, EVERYONE - including democrats and independents. Russia mind-fucked EVERYONE.

### Faith in self harm

It is SELF HARM. You spend your time at the side of the bed until the very last breath. You stand up for humanism. **YOU BECOME THE TEACHER, THE PREACHER** even to your own death and as people kill and murder you and torture you.

You don't act like it is entertainment and amusement!

You don't throw away thousands of years of moral learning and study into the trash and abandon it so you can **giggle away** at people's suffering. You don't turn it into your comedy show that real life suffering is going on.

The answer to stupid  / dumb / idiot / moron isn't being a giggle festival of LOL at humanity being ignorant and stupid.

You stand up as best as you fucking can and you rescue Donald Trump from Putin's self-harm mind fuck. You LEARN about Surkov techniques and you study Cambridge Analtyica. You don't cheer on Russia fucking over the hearts and minds of the USA and NATO!
