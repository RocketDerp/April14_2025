"Moscow’s top gallery-owner advises the Kremlin on propaganda at the same time as exhibiting anti-Kremlin work in his gallery; the most fashionable film director makes a blockbuster satirising the Putin regime while joining Putin’s party; Surkov writes a novel" - October 2011

Is it Year 2011 Russia or Year 2026 USA?

* “If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don’t have to worry about answers.” ― Thomas Pynchon, Gravity’s Rainbow. February 28, 1973

* “One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to **reject any evidence of the bamboozle**. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back. So the old bamboozles tend to persist as the new ones rise.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, **1995**, page 241
