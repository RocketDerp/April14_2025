# Proven

It is proven over and over. Statistics, mathmaticians, probability, we know with certaintiy.

We know that advertising and marketing programs human minds. Clicks are measured. Increased hamburger sales are measured.

Yet we do not teach defense. Every nation is programming every other naton to self-harm. Every military is programming We The People of the Pale Blue Dot, the citizens of the world, to self-harm.

Certain actor voices, certain auto-tine outcomes, certain patterns of music lyrics, certain polticial cartoon styles - they program minds instantly.

And others program long-term

We know the Church raises money selling media, we know the Mosques raises money selling media, we know the Mecca science fiction Quran theme park concentrates power, we know Disney science fiction theme parks conentrante wealth and power.

It is proven. The profits are accounted for by accountants. Advertising and product placement pay for themselves and fund much more.

We have taught machiens how to manipulate our minds with marekting, advertising, public relations, information warfare.

Do you need reminding McDonald's is down the street? Does the proximity of Starbucks and McDonald's not remind you it is already there? Would you travel 1,800 miles for a McDonald's? Why must their logo be put on athletic sports, on healthy people, as *sponsors*?  Why Does McDonald's have toys and amusement, film ties in, video game tie-ins?

It's proven. The doctorates of graduate school, the mathmatic analysits, KNOW how to push minds.

Politicians all learned to tell specific patterns of lies and deceptions, politicians are professional self-decievers of We The People who flock to deception leadership.

Keep your comedy in special venues, keep your science fiction in speical venues. Don't lead your nation with Mecca science ficiton theme park and wildcard meaning poetry and overloaded world John 1:1 meme patterns.

It is proven: Fiction outsells nonfiction. It is proven: Advertising alters behaviors.

People see a McDonald's advert on a sports ball game TV show, then see the sign the next day, there is an association with John 1:1 Bible verse.

The Bible is science fiction. It is proven.
