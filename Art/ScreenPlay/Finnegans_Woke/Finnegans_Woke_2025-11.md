4:20    
such a Divinity exists why are there such horrific things
happening in the world why is there
prejudice against people whose skin color is different from ours.
Why is there prejudice against people whose belief structures are different
from ours? Why can't we see that we're all striving
to know better what's going on in this universe?
And those of us with belief believe that our particular version of things is
right but other people with beliefs believe that their versions of things are right.

5:25    
What I would like us to be able to do those of us who are believers
is a this is my version and you are striving
with your version I prefer mine.
But I acknowledge and accept yours. Oh, some Believers want to say to the people of science you believe that you approach no... the fundamental element of science is not belief. It's in fact doubt when Isaac Newton who in many ways started modern science using mathematics as it fits onto the world
with the help of Kepler who came about 50 60 70 years
before he was working before Newton was working. That is to say
using kepta he came up with some principles and he actually believed
that those principles were the utter truth
Newton in fact was a religious person he wrote more about the Bible
than he wrote about science
many people don't know that but he thought that the physics that he
was working out cosmological answers to how things are in the universe

“Educators may bring upon themselves unnecessary travail by taking a tactless and unjustifiable position about the relation between scientific and religious narratives. We see this, of course, in the conflict concerning creation science. Some educators representing, as they think, the conscience of science act much like those legislators who in 1925 prohibited by law the teaching of evolution in Tennessee. In that case, anti-evolutionists were fearful that a scientific idea would undermine religious belief. Today, pro-evolutionists are fearful that a religious idea will undermine scientific belief. The former had insufficient confidence in religion; the latter insufficient confidence in science. The point is that profound but contradictory ideas may exist side by side, if they are constructed from different materials and methods and have different purposes. Each tells us something important about where we stand in the universe, and it is foolish to insist that they must despise each other.” ― Neil Postman, The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School, year 1992
