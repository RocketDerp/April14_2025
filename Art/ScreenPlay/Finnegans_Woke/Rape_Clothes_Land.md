# Rape, Clothes, Land

Across the world, there is a general topic that clothing is very important.

1. Islamic cultures and veiled women.

2. Asking for rape, dressing like a slut

3. Automatic faith in white men in business suits

4. High class wear, dress codes, excluding the poor. Fashion police.

Ok

# Land ownership / tresspass

Why do people not criticize locks on doors / gates / fences / security systems.

People blame *men* who rape women because of clothing / slut asks for it.    

What about the temptation of owning land. Killing off the previous owners, native Americans / native peoples from year 1492 in Americas?

Is the thinking that natives were asking to havee their land taken away because they didn't dress up their land in military defense systems.

Men can't control their penis desires?    
Men can't control their land conquest desires?     
Men can't control their grand theft auto desires?     

Not sure if I am serious at all writing this.

Mother Earth rape metaphors.
