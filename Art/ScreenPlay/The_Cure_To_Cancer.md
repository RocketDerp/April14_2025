# The Cure To Cancer

If people cared about curing cancer and preventing diseases and findng medicines...

At some point you come to terms that contributing factual inforamtion about the world to organized systems like Wikipedia.

A personal experience of mine is Tom Campbell who was owner of eSnipe.com website in year 2000 and I worked with him for 9 years. He had a child, he told me that during pregnacy his wife didn't get enough "A diet deficient in certain nutrients, especially folic acid (folate), increases the risk of spinal disorders like spina bifida during pregnancy"

When he told me this story, he was clearly distraught, because I know Tom, and he prizes information and learning - and he clealry ahd overlooked a technical thing about his daughters. I have never forgotten this conversation, it haunts me.

During the Arab Spring in Middle East, I was living in Jordan and my wife went back to Africa for a month to deal with school issues and family. So I went my myself to linve in Larnica, Cyprus for a month. This was weeks after the storage explosion. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelos_Florakis_Naval_Base_explosion 

And I had been living in Texas as my USA base and the factory explosion in year 2013 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Fertilizer_Company_explosion

I sseriously considered creating a website of all dangerous places like this that had ticking time-bomb explosions. It crossed my mind several times year 2014 onward but I passed on the project. And sure enough, year 2020 came along and another. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosion

The 2020 Beruit explision was a lot like the year 2011 Cyprus explision in that it was just sitting there in storage next to people and valualble things and people were not educated to inspect it and protect it as risky as it was!

If we really want the world to be safer and better, we al should be buuilding a series of Super Wiki style systems of progressively improving human knowledge and making subjects interlink so we ae mappng out the diseases / treatments / preventoins / etc.

Think of electrical codes and building codes and best practices and money-saving yet still safe ways of doing things to prvent house fires, rodents disease spreading, food contamination, etc.
