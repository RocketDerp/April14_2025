# Never Gets Old

Niceness, compassion, love

Competitition for hate, comeptition for war, competititon for weapon systems, competititon for machine lust, competititions for dehumanization, competititions for wrecking planet Earth. Badness itself. Why do people actlike hate is rewarding? That misunderstanding of love are comprehension?

Competition for trcking and manipulating people. For setting traps, for gaming others out of goodness.
