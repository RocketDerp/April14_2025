# Fandoms of Trump Death

It's impossible to ignore the fandoms of Trump.   
The Death Cult of Donald Trump.   
People who comment day in and day out the parties they have planed, the special gifts, the sacred foods they are stockpiling for the Trump Death.  

This cult of death does not want goodness, only death can satisfy their desires.   
Goodness is boring. Nonfiction science learning is boring and unattractivee.

But Trump attracts a deeply serious death cult.
Fantasy dreaming away, day after day, about their marriage to death cult symbolism.
