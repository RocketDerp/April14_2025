# Arguing 

People think you are arguing for emtions, people think wihtout thinking about the Tower of Babel metaphor, the multi-langauge conflicts of the Levant.

Semites language ties, metaphors of "Semite" itself, and "Anti-semitism", Anti Hebrew, Anti Arabic.

Anti-translation of Quran to Torah, metaphor to metaphor level translation.

Aruging? no. Understanding reality of the real world and science? very very very rare.

Truth is one. The stars in outer space may as well be light-bulbs installed in The Trueman Show, the True Man who sees a lamp fall from the sky, man-made, or campfires out in space with a gap you can't measure.

"The Yolngu people see stars as the campfires of their ancestors who have journeyed to the sky."

Every personal relationshp I've had people think I'm arguing with them, and my autism language brain damage argues back with me. 

Donald J. Trump is the opposite of autism, No matter how brain damaged Trump is from Cambridge Analytica mind-fuck brian damage or Russian Putin Kremlin mind-fuck brain damage... people can't resist adotping the Trump-speak langauge and comrpehending what he says and rewriting the Earth to match what Trump Says. The opposite of anti-popularity problem of autism experience many share. 

I have Hyper Empathy, not an abscence of empathy. Elon Musk has anti-empathy, which is why Trump was attracted to Musk and Putin, anti-empathy.

Anti-compassion.
