* "David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, published in 1996, deeply embeds references to William Shakespeare’s Hamlet (first published in roughly 1603 in the First Quarto). The title itself is a direct quote from Act V, Scene 1, where Hamlet looks at Yorick’s skull and speaks of "a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy". Within the text, this parallel is extended through the "Poor Yorick" Entertainment (a lethal film), the familial drama echoing Hamlet’s, and the "sazmat" joke (a colloquial, likely phonetic shortening of "safe zone" or "saz," referring to the "Them can kill you but the legalities of eating you are quite a bit dicier" joke in the footnotes) that highlights the novel's dark, absurdist, and meta-textual tone. While Hamlet explores the inability to act in the face of truth, DFW’s novel uses these references to explore addiction, entertainment, and the search for meaning in a postmodern world." - Google Search summary 2026-01-08 Sports Addiction Super Bowl morning USA

* “Youth instinctively understands the present environment—the electric drama. It lives mythically and in depth. This is the reason for the great alienation between generations.”

* The mechanics of not teaching the **Free Masons** Founding Fathers of the United States of America. The Dollar Bill symbols were forgotten generation after generation since year 1915. The Constitution and Deceleration of Independence and Bill of Rights make zero sense if you can't comprehend and understand and read the meaning of overloaded words. Free Mason teachings were essential and core to the letter of the law vs. spirit of the law, the spiritual concerns of the eye at the top of the pyramid meaning and perspectives. The mechanic here is: failure to teach, failure to pass down serous Latin language meanings and Hindu symbolism.. and Africa focus.
