USA population is blind that amusement jokes are why Donald Trump became most powerful man in the world. The population, the citizens of USA have thrust their #BadHumor upon the world. #DiaperFetish + #OrangeSkin shit.

* "David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, published in 1996, deeply embeds references to William Shakespeare’s Hamlet (first published in roughly 1603 in the First Quarto). The title itself is a direct quote from Act V, Scene 1, where Hamlet looks at Yorick’s skull and speaks of "a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy". Within the text, this parallel is extended through the "Poor Yorick" Entertainment (a lethal film), the familial drama echoing Hamlet’s, and the "sazmat" joke (a colloquial, likely phonetic shortening of "safe zone" or "saz," referring to the "Them can kill you but the legalities of eating you are quite a bit dicier" joke in the footnotes) that highlights the novel's dark, absurdist, and meta-textual tone. While Hamlet explores the inability to act in the face of truth, DFW’s novel uses these references to explore addiction, entertainment, and the search for meaning in a postmodern world." - Google Search summary 2026-01-08 Sports Addiction Super Bowl morning USA

* James O. Incandenza runs 'Poor Yorick Entertainment,' and Hamlet refers to Yorick as "a fellow of infinite jest".

* It is part of the "Found Dramas" or experimental films created by James Incandenza, described as a "soliloquized parody" or a slice-of-life, with the "joke" being the viewer watching themselves.

* The film "Infinite Jest (IV)" is also listed in the filmography as a potential earlier, perhaps even more dangerous version of the "Entertainment" (the cartridge that is the focus of the novel).

# Some Mechanics Of the Jokes

Machine mechanics are involved in the joke

The distance between peers on social machine systems.

* “Youth instinctively understands the present environment — the **electric drama**. It lives **mythically** and in depth. This is the reason for the great alienation between generations.”
* *  the book “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects” by media analyst Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore, and coordinated by Jerome Agel. It was published in March 1967

* The mechanics of not teaching the **Free Masons** Founding Fathers of the United States of America. The Dollar Bill symbols were forgotten generation after generation since year 1915. The Constitution and Deceleration of Independence and Bill of Rights make zero sense if you can't comprehend and understand and read the meaning of overloaded words. Free Mason teachings were essential and core to the letter of the law vs. spirit of the law, the spiritual concerns of the eye at the top of the pyramid meaning and perspectives. The mechanic here is: failure to teach, failure to pass down serous Latin language meanings and Hindu symbolism.. and Africa focus.

# Trump 2 Joke beyond "Infinite Jest IV" potency

The inability to stop compulsive joking about Donald Trump's diapers and poop toilet humor is the Trump 2 joke. Joke-washing and amusement-washing became constantly game-loop grinding mechanisms of Trump and ICE power. Reddit social is the core platform for cleaning and washing Trump as a prized nugget of shit to joke about constantly.

The mechanism at play here is mob mentality. Technically gifted and experienced technical users of Reddit who know how to use high speed information systems... and steer these same systems of information towards their infantile poop humor. Meme shockwaves that land on Trump. Because Reddit comment creators use the mechanism of ICE masking their own identity, their own home city, their own real life. Self-dehumanizing monster masks. This mechanic is the monster force of Reddit culture.

1. I created this teaching SubReddit on Reddit itself. "Hyper Banalization" https://old.Reddit.com/r/HyperBanalisation/comments/bjf6ys/under_the_surkov_media_invasion_of_russia_usa/ - to describe the poop smearing Reddit fandoms of Trump.

2. ICE masked / Reddit audience masked identity in shit-posting shit-commenting

3. Published year 1988. BILL MOYERS: ... romance based upon selflessness rather than selfishness.
CAMPBELL: The fact that the evil power is not identified with any specific nation on this earth means you’ve got an abstract power, which represents a principle, not a specific historical situation. The story has to do with an operation of principles, not of this nation against that. **The monster masks that are put on people in Star Wars represent the real monster force in the modern world**. When the mask of Darth Vader is removed, you see an unformed man, one who has not developed as a human individual. What you see is a strange and pitiful sort of undifferentiated face.
MOYERS: What’s the significance of that?
CAMPBELL: Darth Vader has not developed his own humanity. He’s a robot. He’s a bureaucrat, living not in terms of himself but in terms of an imposed system. This is the threat to our lives that we all face today. Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you your humanity, or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of **human purposes**? How do you relate to the system so that you are not **compulsively** serving it?
