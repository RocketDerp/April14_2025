# ToDo:

1. Vanessa Carlton eclipse, Ordinary Day
2. Pink Floyd Eclipse / Brain Damage (Brain Rot Society 47 link)

3. "Turn around, bright eyes" from eclipse of the inward heart lyrics. MLK Jr left behind quotes. Styx Suite Madame Blue, long ago in the past, turn around ending lyrics.
4. "Bright eyes" lyrics to Suite Madame Blue ... Looking glass.

5. "Every now and then I fall apart", Iterations of Finnegans Wake the Free Mason Tim bricklayer (freed from permanent death) symbolism. Fall of Wall Street, Page 3 of Joyce's work.

6. Forever is going to start *tonight*, night hours of Dublin / Finnegans Wake.

7. Remotivate the men themes. Building with bricks like Tim Finnegan, not shitting concrete to cover over goodness like MAGA / Murdoch / Musk / Trump / Putin.

8. Eclipse of ALP, "EclipeHCE" hashtag (dual meaning. eclipse the toxic male attitudes, and HCE everybody Pluribus level-up eclipse)? Anna Livia Plurabelle (ALP) is a central, symbolic character in James Joyce's novel Finnegans Wake. Representing the River Liffey and eternal femininity, she embodies renewal and flow.

9. Be The New Man - Woke Carol hashtag looping integration and Finnegans Wake iteration?
