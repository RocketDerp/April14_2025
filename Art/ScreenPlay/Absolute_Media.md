# Absolute Media

In year 2013, Cambridge Analytica did not study media ecology of Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan. They did not have the philosophical insight and context issues of knowing that medium itself drove the change. Facebook vs. paper maagine, Facebook vs. printed book. Facebook vs. traditioanl television (people in the same city all seeing the same show content at the same time).

## Paradox of the Kremlin Story

Russia claims Trump recommended "Cambridge Analytica" in November 7, 2013

"Cambridge Analytica (SCL USA) was incorporated in January 2013 with its registered office being in Westferry Circus, London"

Maybe the story is condensed - leaving out intermediate steps of November 2012 to July 2013, maybe the November 2012 claim is total fiction, a backfill idea ceated for November 2016 messages to make false claims of year 2012 activities.

The evidence of the Internet Research Agency goes back to 2014. June 2, 2014 in English "Western" coveage. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/maxseddon/documents-show-how-russias-troll-army-hit-america - which points to Russian coverage and ...

"budget for April 2014, its first month, lists costs for 25 employees and expenses that together total over $75,000. The Internet Research Agency itself, founded last summer, now employs over 600 people and, if spending levels from December 2013 to April continue, is set to budget for over $10 million in 2014"

This is a bit confusing. "last summer" would indicate in Summer year 2013. But the statemnet "April 2014, its first month"... but this story is published summer of 2014. June 2, 2014 on Buzzfeed News.

"Internet Research Energy is only one of several firms believed to be employing pro-Kremlin comment trolls. That has long been suspected based on the comments under articles about Russia on many other sites, such as Kremlin propaganda network RT's wildly successful YouTube channel."

It isn't the only name. Nor is Surkov the only peson. (Is "Energy" a typo in that article, "Agency").

The activities don't go under the name "Internet Research Agency" in October 2025. I emphasize the name because it got the most coverage. Same with Surkov. Although Surkov is the one I think through his fiction publications and song selections demonstrates a MonoMyth meme arrangement that points to the James Joyce 1905 to 1930 levels. Not with as much labor as invested Joyce did, and not with the outcomes of Joyce, but with the modern tools of samples / clips / research / composition that same level of mind... with a focus on the "dark side" inspirations, the harm of humanity, where Joyce is lifting humanity, Surkov is sinking into the metahor of Hell.

## The mess is so bad

Specific facts in a Surkovian world become nightmarish. Not because you can't track them down, but because anyone you communicate will not accept them. The Tower of Babel metaphor dominates experience since year 2013.

Did CA release 5,000 patterns? no idea. My focus is from Finnegans Wake to Marshall McLuhan. Finnegans Wake to Joseph Campbell (all his work). Finnegans Wake to Jean Erdman ("Coach With the Six Insides"). Finnegans Wake to Anthony Burgess 1973 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMubEjUAIk

My focus is: "Finnegans Wake is the greatest guidebook to media study ever fashioned by man." - Marshall McLuhan, Newsweek Magazine, p.56, February 28, 1966

My focus is the LSD drug experience claims of Marshall McLuhan and Finnegans Wake.  https://youtube.com/watch?v=-f2F02gsYsk

My focus is my own Christian childhood experience with Trinity English Luthern Church in Fort Wayne, Indiana. My focus is my own Islamic Quran experiences living in Algeria, Jordan, Malaysia, Indonesia. My focus is my own Christian Catholic experience of a boy scout troup in Fort Wayne and weekend (Sunday) rituals, and living in Chritian Arica, Chile - South America.  My focus is the media ecology iexperience of religin 

Ultimatly James Joyce knows The Bible is a dream and focuses on the arragement of dream memes. Ultimatly Joseph Campbell declares Public Dream vs. Private Dream. We come up to the Great Seal of the United States of America as a "Dream Machine", an arrangement of Dream Interpretations, Mythology.

John 1:1 

The way we react to language, the ever-shifting meanings of words, and how that gets into our emotions and our interpretation and conception of what others are saying. The context our mind is in as we listen, read. Th emeanings shifts of re-rading a book the second time a couple months later.

Is the claim entirely bullshit?

Константин Рыков. November 12, 2016. "
Настало время замечательных историй. Расскажу вам о том (теперь уже можно), как мы с Дональдом Трампом приняли решение освободить Америку и сделать её снова великой. На это нам понадобилось целых 4 года и ещё 2 дня. **Всё началось ночью с 6 на 7 ноября 2012 года.**"
