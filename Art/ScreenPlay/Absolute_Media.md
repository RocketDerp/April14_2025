# Absolute Media

In year 2013, Cambridge Analytica did not study media ecology of Neil Postman and Marshall McLuhan. They did not have the philosophical insight and context issues of knowing that medium itself drove the change. Facebook vs. paper maagine, Facebook vs. printed book. Facebook vs. traditioanl television (people in the same city all seeing the same show content at the same time).

## Paradox of the Kremlin Story

Russia claims Trump recommended "Cambridge Analytica" in November 7, 2013

"Cambridge Analytica (SCL USA) was incorporated in January 2013 with its registered office being in Westferry Circus, London"

Maybe the story is condined, maybe it is total fiction, a backfill idea ceated for November 2016 messages to make false claims of year 2012 activities.

The evidence of the Internet Research Agency goes back to 2014.
