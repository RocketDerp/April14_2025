"How the Moon Landing Ruined Conspiracy Theories"

USA centered video content.

“The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013. Swat Valley Pakistan (very far from Mecca, very far from USA moon landing)

Fiction outsells not fiction.

Trolling for mythology. Bible is mythology, Bible is science fiction, Matthew 4:19 is not fiction.

## Word Choice magic

The simplistic mind reading of a single word choice. The power USA police have to detect a situation based on 15 seconds of obervation and listening. (Police in USA / I.C.E. in USA have very poor and limited training on how mass mind (Howard Bloom terminology) / mass man (Marshall McLuhan terminology) / society operating system works). Tower of Babel language that you can determine some great important topic by use of "negro" vs. "black" vs. "African-American", or "female" vs "women". And that the age and education and even the mental overlaod of the person in word choice. Are they very tired, have they not slept well for 96 hours and they choose the word "female" over "women" or other words? Choosing "person" over "woman" or the word "person" over "female"? How one single world choice is prized and interpreted as mutual comprehension and undestanding on a massive scale. Micro vs. macro scale of a single world choice.

This is exactly the crisis that Finnegans Wake year 1924, James Joyce, is highlighting... the Tower of Babel problem. The Jewish Israel vs. Muslim Mecca vs. Christian vs. non-believer, gentile, infidel, out-group languge and word choice toxic clergy teachings.
