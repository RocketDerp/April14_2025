ToDo: somewhere in this GitHub project there is a idea of mapping out predicgable learned bullshit. Flat earth, moon landing, etc. You LEARN about the moon landing, it is an event of human history. You can't know of it via your own staring at the moon, it is passed down knolwedge. And there are mass mind / gorup think / mob mentality patterns of falsehoods people accept. Monomyth science fiction.

They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
