It has never been more clear since year 2022 with the widespread embrace of ChatGPT - that the ability to distinguish falsehoods is not biological testing.

ToDo: somewhere in this GitHub project there is a idea of mapping out predicgable learned bullshit. Flat earth, moon landing, etc. You LEARN about the moon landing, it is an event of human history. You can't know of it via your own staring at the moon, it is passed down knolwedge. And there are mass mind / gorup think / mob mentality patterns of falsehoods people accept. Monomyth science fiction.

We are talking LEARNNG, TEACHING, EDUCATION, SCHOOLS, MEDIA VENUES, MEDIA ECOLOGY, AQUIRED KNOWLEDGE. “The boys learn the Quran by heart, rocking back and forth as they recite. They learn that there is no such thing as science or literature, that dinosaurs never existed and man never went to the moon.”
― Malala Yousafzai, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban. October 8, 2013. Nonfiction.

Back to ChatGPT

It does not matter if the INTENTION is deception, manipulation. It can be machine reproduced. If you educate a pesson like Malala says, they will state there was no moon landing and it's fiction. And they will state that the science fiction Quran is nonfiction!

The ability to validate information / confirm sources / fact-check is not OPTIONAL. marketing / advertising / gaming / ARG / politics / Putin Surkov Russian methods / are all games to exploit weak spots in the human brain to trick and deceive people. We can't keep behaving as if this isn't accidental. 

“We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to **cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into “user experience,” “gamification,” “growth hacking,” and “engagement” by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do**. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to **exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition**? Do we really want to live in a “gamified” environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?” ― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, chapter 12 "Revelations", page 235, year 2019
