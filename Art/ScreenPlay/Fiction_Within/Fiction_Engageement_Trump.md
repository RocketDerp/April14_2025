# Fiction Engagement: Trump

Trump gets what everyone else does not get. People do not understand Donald Trump.

Comging from Russian Reality TV https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960/is the way to understand Donald Trump "The Apprentice" Reality TV / Rality Casino entertainment (not profit, but media influence) experience. 

People so programmed by Hoolywood "to Follow the MoneY" don't see that Hollywood is willing to make flops. Hollywood gambles on films and is a failing casino. Because that's how ENTERTAINMENT Reality Hollywood works. And Trump grasps that. He isn't running a Casino for profit, he is running it to grasp why classy people think Casino Boxing and Casino Comedy is respectable. The decoration / the Ballroom of the White House gilding.

# People don't get Trump

TRUMP GETS IT:

***FICTION OUTSELLS NONFICTION***

Lavel it "True Lies", and "Rerality TV" (Unreality Reality) and FICTION OUTSELLS EVEN MORE!

Tony Clifton performances OUTSELF EVEN MORE YET!

Trump gets it what nobody can get about Trump: Fiction Outsells Nonfiction.

A White House that goes all in, ccasino style card games all in, on fiction. A franchies of the Kremlin Reality Surkov evolutions. The Surkov student screenplays plus NYC SNL Andky Kaufman Trump NYC.

People run around "correcting" the Pentagon, White House, Musk under Trump leadership. It creates ENGAEMENT of correcting Trump. It spread the brand. It goes viral. The lies are far more engaging / fiction outsells nonfiction!

PEOPLE DO NOT GRASP THIS. NOBODY IS DEMONSTARTING SELF-AWARENESS HERE!

The Surkov technique franchies with Clifon Kaufman, Mr. Donald Kaufman, Mr. Tony Trump - blending Surkov / Putin and Clifon! Is leap hears beyond Fox News.

Humanity never lived in nonfiction! Science was not poular. The HISTORY of science is very short. Carl Sagan Cosmos!
