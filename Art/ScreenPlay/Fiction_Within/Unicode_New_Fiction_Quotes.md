Putting words into a mouth quotes.   

Inauthentic, non-factual, fiction quotes, attributed to a person.   

Let me rephrase that for you quotes.

There needs to be a convention for such quotes that people strive to honor and use. The mark ideally should be entirely new to not be confused with any existing purpose.

Could be rendered like italics, etc for inline text... but a begin and end element. 

&nbsp;

Further: a marker for citation section. Links to real quotes. A special unicode character pair to distinguish a citation / reference inline.
