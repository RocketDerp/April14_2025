# Mocking Mistakes, Misfortune

One-penmanship as the deepest faith in society. Tried to teach others once or twice, maybe a few times, and enough is enough, giving up on people understanding.

Free time and spare time spent in service to mocking and insulting to *teach a lesson*, the dehumanization of out-groups who don't comprehend the Tower of Babel is an ego issue, egoism, experience.

### Faith in mocking

### Faith in insulting

### Faith in laughing and creating laugh-tracks

## What is Progress?

Misfortune of others is winning. Stand still and let your enemy harm itself. An enemy mentality. That human beings are your enemy and any you can gain advantage of as enemy the better off you are.

Not my stance, not what Malala articulates better than I can write and speak. Malala at age 15 could articulate the problem better than I can at age 55.
