# Mocking Mistakes, Misfortune

One-upmanship as the deepest faith in society. Tried to teach others once or twoce, maybe a few times, and enough is enough, giving up on people understanding.

Free time and spare time spent in service to mocking and insutling to *teach a lesson*, the dehumanization of out-groups who don't coprehend the Tower of Babel is an ego issue, egoism, experience.

### Faith in mocking

### Faith in insutling

### Faith in laughing and creating laugh-tracks

## What is Progress?

Misfortune of others is winning. Stand still and let your enemy harm itself. An emeny mentality. That human beings are your enemy and any you can gain advatnage of as enemy the better off you are.

Not my stance, not what Malala articules better than I can write and speak. Malaa at age 15 could articulate the problem better than I can at age 55.
