Kingston and another vendor are selling a 64MB upgrade for the TP 560.
I just got a new 2GB/133 560 and am holding out for the 64MB upgrade
(72MB total).  They are supposed to ship this week...  The price was
about double that of a 32MB...

Anyone purchasing new today should look at the total cost of their
investment... \

RAM is cheap compared to what it used to be (9 months ago for laptops),
and 72MB on a laptop isn't that far fetched.  If you think you could be
running Windows 97 or Windows NT Workstation.... the $200 to $400
difference would seem  a given...   For others, even on Windows 95,
there is only one expansion module (and you would have to throw away or
sell to get new).  A new purchaser should consider the 2 to 3 year
lifespan of a typical laptop.... and think about it...
