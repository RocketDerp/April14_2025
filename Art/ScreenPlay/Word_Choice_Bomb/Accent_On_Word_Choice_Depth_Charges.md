* "There is a kind of humanization of the myth material in both of these cultures. There is a very strong accent on the human"

* "This I do not understand. I do understand the accent on the local social deity for people who are living in a desert. Your whole commitment is to the society which is protecting you. Society is always patriarchal. Nature is always matrilineal."

* "You can put an accent on it that way, but I think it’s a little too strong because there were the great female saints. Hildegarde of Bingen—she was a match for Innocent III. And Eleanor of Aquitaine—I don’t think there is anybody in the Middle Ages who has the stature to match hers. One now can look back and quarrel with the whole situation, but the situation of women was not that bad by any means."

* "It was important in that it gave the West this accent on the individual, that one should have faith in his *experience* and not simply mouth terms handed down to him by others."

INTERESTING NOTE: this got removed from ~~MIT public Internet since~~ Google Search since I last checked 2024-11-26 despite been public Internet since 1997-05-01 -- OK mailing list still there. Why has Google Search removed the one file with my username  in the past year?
