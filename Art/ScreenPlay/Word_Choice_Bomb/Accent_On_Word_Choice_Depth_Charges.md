* "There is a kind of humanization of the myth material in both of these cultures. There is a very strong accent on the human"

* "This I do not understand. I do understand the accent on the local social deity for people who are living in a desert. Your whole commitment is to the society which is protecting you. Society is always patriarchal. Nature is always matrilineal."
