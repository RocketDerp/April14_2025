# German

I'm blonde hair, blue eyed, (Nordic Aryan prized attributes) like my mother.

Both my parent's families settled in Ohio after immigrating from Germany back in year 18xx or whatever.

I have autism. 

RFK Jr. has made autism a current joke for the Reddit home page to joke-wash.

I worked for a Germany company, SAP. Traveled to thier HQ in Waldorf, Germany early in my computing career. 

&nbsp;

I was born in Columbus Georgia unlike my mother / father / brother Jeff / brother Jon all born in Ohio.

I learned a few things about Nazi mind-fucking from Putin's time spent in the KGB before the Berlin Wall fell.

### Leo Buscaglia On Nazi Germany

"I am a survivor of a concentration camp. My eyes saw what no person should witness. Gas chambers built by learned engineers. Children poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and killed by high school and college graduates. So I'm suspicious of education. My request is: help your students to be human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, or educated Eichmanns. Reading and writing and spelling and history and arithmetic are only important if they serve to make our students human."

You know what occurred to me? We teach everything in the world to people, except the most essential thing. And that is life. Nobody teaches you about life. You're supposed to know about it. Nobody teaches you how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being, and the dignity that it means when you say, "I am a human being." Everyone assumes this is something you have, or you should have gotten by osmosis. We'll it's not working by osmosis!

- From the chapter "The Art of Being Fully Human" page 127 of "Living, Loving & Learning" by Leo Buscaglia, Ph. D. as he refers to Haim Ginott's book

### Hate Training Observations

On the other side of the religious divide stood the new Fundamentalists of Racial Purity and Christianity, whose leaders skillfully manipulated conformity enforcement mechanisms which impel us to pick on those who are different. Typical among these was a group called **Russian National Unity,** which claimed an army of 70,000, snapped up members at the age of nine, enrolled them in "military patriotic clubs," dressed them in fascist uniforms, **gave them the insignia of the swastika, taught them the Nazi salute,** drilled them in combat maneuvers, honed their marksmanship, and identified the target of their weapons in their anthem:

    we are going down the straight road
    to believe, desire, and dare
    death to the cosmopolitan dogs and Jews and masons!

National Unity's founder, karate coach Alexander Barkashov, quoted yet another tune when giving interviews on the dangers of world Jewry and of the United States:

    Plunge your knife in the vampire's throat  
    And the world will become good again.

Many parents welcomed National Unity's training for mass murder.

NOTE: I like to emphasize that this book was published before September 11, 2001 terrorism attacks on USA by Islamic / Saudi Arabians / Mecca science fiction media empire followers. As it offers a great perspective of NYC research and thinking before 9/11 changed so many attitudes.

Again, 1969 Georgia, I've listened to some of the hate prizing. Autism can be a real wake-up call when you discover you have hyper empathy. And what machine lust lovers are doing to humanism in flocking to Putin / Kremlin mental programming since year 2013. Humor-washing the abandonment of goodness. I lived in the Middle East and looked real hard on what ideas people prize, toxic clergy of hate and dehumanization of out-groups. And I have not forgotten the Atlanta, Georgia reformation teachings in October 2025.

### The 1954 Equation

February 28, 1954: "Most people can't stand up for their convictions, because the majority of people might not be doing it. See, everybody's not doing it, so it must be wrong. And since everybody is doing it, it must be right. So a sort of numerical interpretation of what's right. But I'm here to say to you this morning that some things are right and some things are wrong. Eternally so, absolutely so. **It's wrong to hate.** It always has been wrong and it always will be wrong. It's wrong in America, it's wrong in Germany, it's wrong in Russia, it's wrong in China. It was wrong in 2000 B.C., and it's wrong in 1954 A.D. It always has been wrong, and it always will be wrong." - Martin Luther King Jr.

"For the person who hates, the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful. For the person who hates, the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good. For the person who hates, the **true becomes false and the false becomes true**. That's what hate does. You can't see right. **The symbol of objectivity** is lost." - Martin Luther King Jr.
