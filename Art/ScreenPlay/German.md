# German

I'm blonde hair, blue eyed, like my mother.

Both my parent's families settled in Ohio after immigrating from Germany back in year 18xx or whatever.

I have autism. 

RFK Jr. has made autism a current joke for the Reddit home page to joke-wash.

I worked for a Germany company, SAP. Traveled to thier HQ in Waldorf, Germany early in my computing career.
