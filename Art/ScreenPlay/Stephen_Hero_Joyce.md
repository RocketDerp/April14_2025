Summer of 1986 or Summer of 1987

CAMPBELL: There are some teachers who decide they won’t teach at all because of what society will do with what they’ve found.

MOYERS: What if the hero returns from his ordeal, and the world doesn’t want what he brings back?

CAMPBELL: That, of course, is a normal experience. It isn’t always so much that the world doesn’t want the gift, but that it doesn’t know how to receive it and how to institutionalize it—

MOYERS: —how to keep it, how to renew it.

CAMPBELL: Yes, how to help keep it going.

MOYERS: I’ve always liked that image of life being breathed back into the dry bones, back into the ruins and the relics.

CAMPBELL: There is **a kind of secondary hero to revitalize** the tradition. This hero reinterprets the tradition and makes it valid as a living experience today instead of a lot of outdated clichés. This has to be done with all traditions.
