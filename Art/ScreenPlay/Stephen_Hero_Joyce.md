# Stephen Hero, Joyce

"It is the early version of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Its published form reflects only a portion of the manuscript: the first 518 pages have disappeared; 383 pages remain."

Summer of 1986 or Summer of 1987

CAMPBELL: There are some teachers who decide they won’t teach at all because of what society will do with what they’ve found.

MOYERS: What if the hero returns from his ordeal, and the world doesn’t want what he brings back?

CAMPBELL: That, of course, is a normal experience. It isn’t always so much that the world doesn’t want the gift, but that it doesn’t know how to receive it and how to institutionalize it—

MOYERS: —how to keep it, how to renew it.

CAMPBELL: Yes, how to help keep it going.

MOYERS: I’ve always liked that image of life being breathed back into the dry bones, back into the ruins and the relics.

CAMPBELL: There is **a kind of secondary hero to revitalize** the tradition. This hero reinterprets the tradition and makes it valid as a living experience today instead of a lot of outdated clichés. This has to be done with all traditions.

# Revelations of Stephen 

http://www.gnosis.org/library/revstev.htm      

From "The Apocryphal New Testament"    
M.R. James-Translation and Notes    
Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924    

"a mighty wind: the stars shall fall, the heavens open, the books be brought forward. The twelve angels who are set over every soul shall unveil the deeds of men. The sea shall move and give up what is in it. The mountains fall, all the surface of the earth becomes smooth."

**Isaiah 40:4** ?
