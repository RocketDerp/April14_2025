## Crazy runs in the Joyce family

In a diagnostic, which Mr. Ellmann does not like, Jung wrote that "the relationship of father and daughter was a kind of mystical identity or participation." Jung called Lucia "her father's anima inspiratrix." "Joyce's psychological style is definitely schizophrenic, with the difference, however, that the ordinary patient cannot help himself talking and thinking in such a way, while Joyce willed it and moreover developed it with all his creative forces.Which, incidentally explains, why he himself did not go over the border. But his daughter did, because she was no genius like her father, but merely a victim of the disease. In any other time of the past Joyce's work would never have reached the printers, but in our blessed XXth century it is a message, though not yet understood."

## Married Joyceians 

Jean and Joseph. J & J, teacher and student, student and teacher. Two experts in Joyce. In USA New York City and Hawaii, no Irish nationalism motives of Dublin storytelling.

Joseph Campbell Foundation to this very day published this association: "James Joyce’s daughter, Lucia Joyce, in the early 1930s consulted Carl Jung as a last resort in dealing with her psychic ailments. Jung did not hesitate to interpret her mental condition as a kind of symptom, the product of being imbued into the titanic spiritual currents with which her father was contending. The presumption is that her father’s creative genius exposed her to the strongest waves of the archetypal psyche from a very young age." https://www.jcf.org/post/the-sacrificial-wheel-of-fortune

### Cambell knew and edited Carl Jung 

### Campbell was contacted by Doctor John Weir Perry

### Suprresed Knowledge

Why is the litary world, book world, so afraid of this topic? So avoidant?

# James Joyce Himself February 1912

Februarhy 1912 is LONG before Finns Hotel in year 1923! Long before creating FInnegans Wake. The self-awareness of audience reactions to Quran science fiction stories. Bible science fiction stories, Torah science fiction stories, Upanishads science fiction stories, Buddha science fiction stories... Celtic science fiction stories... Monomyth patterns all (Page 581 Finnegans Wake)... was WELL KNOWN to James Joyce. Catholic vs. Protestant in Ireland: Peopel calling EACH OTHER crazy for how to read ONE SINGLE book, The BIble scieence fiction! Calling each other insane, crazy, morons for having mutliple interpretations of poetry words of a science fiction story! James Joyce saw this in year 1912!

"To say that a great genius is half-mad, while recognizing his artistic prowess, is worth as much as saying that he was rheumatic, or that he suffered from diabetes. Madness, in fact, is a medical expression to which a balanced critic should pay no more heed than he would to the accusation of heresy brought by the theologian, or to the accusation of immorality brought by the public prosecutor."
"Realism and Idealism in English Literature (Daniel Defoe - William Blake)," lecture, Università Popolare, Trieste (February 27-28, 1912), printed in James Joyce: Occasional, Critical and Political Writing (2002) edited by Kevin Barry (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-192-83353-7), page 179
